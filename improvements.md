Here are a few ways you could improve this Python script:

Add comments to the code explaining what each block of code does. This will make it easier for others to understand the logic behind the script and how it works.

Use more descriptive variable and function names. For example, instead of using entry1 and entry2 as the names of variables, you could use more descriptive names like first_article and second_article to make it clear what these variables represent.

Add error handling to the code to catch and handle any potential errors that may arise during execution. This will prevent the script from crashing and make it more robust.

Add some documentation to the script explaining how to use it and what the different input and output parameters represent. This will make it easier for others to understand how to use the script and what it does.

Consider refactoring the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain. For example, you could move some of the functions into separate files and import them into the main script, which will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Overall, there are many ways you could improve this Python script to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable.
