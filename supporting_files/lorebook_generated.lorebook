            "text": "The syntax of the Python programming language is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted . The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.  Design philosophy Python was designed to be a highly readable language. It has a relatively uncluttered visual layout and uses English keywords frequently where other languages use punctuation. Python aims to be simple and consistent in the design of its syntax, encapsulated in the mantra There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it , from the Zen of Python.This mantra is deliberately opposed to the Perl and Ruby mantra, there's more than one way to do it .  Keywords Python has 35 keywords or reserved words; they cannot be used as identifiers. In addition, Python also has 3 soft keywords. Unlike regular hard keywords, soft keywords are reserved words only in the limited contexts where interpreting them as keywords would make syntactic sense. These words can be used as identifiers elsewhere; You can define a function or variable named match or case. case matchNotes  Indentation Python uses whitespace to delimit control flow blocks . Python borrows this feature from its predecessor ABC: instead of punctuation or keywords, it uses indentation to indicate the run of a block. In so called free format languages that use the block structure derived from ALGOL blocks of code are set off with braces or keywords. In most coding conventions for these languages, programmers conventionally indent the code within a block, to visually set it apart from the surrounding code. A recursive function named foo, which is passed a single parameter, x, and if the parameter is 0 will call a different function named bar and otherwise will call baz, passing x, and also call itself recursively, passing x 1 as the parameter, could be implemented like this in Python: and could be written like this in C with K R indent style: Incorrectly indented code could be misread by a human reader differently than it would be interpreted by a compiler or interpreter. For example, if the function call foo on the last line in the example above was erroneously indented to be outside the if else block: it would cause the last line to always be executed, even when x is 0, resulting in an endless recursion. While both space and tab characters are accepted as forms of indentation and any multiple of spaces can be used, spaces are recommended and 4 spaces are recommended and are by far the most commonly used. Mixing spaces and tabs on consecutive lines is not allowed starting with Python 3 because that can create bugs which are difficult to see, since many tools do not visually distinguish spaces and tabs.  Data structures  Since Python is a dynamically typed language, Python values, not variables, carry type information. All variables in Python hold references to objects, and these references are passed to functions. Some people have called this parameter passing scheme call by object reference . An object reference means a name, and the passed reference is an alias , i.e. a copy of the reference to the same object, just as in C C . The object's value may be changed in the called function with the alias , for example: Function my func changes the value of alist with the formal argument al, which is an alias of alist. However, any attempt to operate on the alias itself will have no effect on the original object. In Python, non innermost local and not declared global accessible names are all aliases. Among dynamically typed languages, Python is moderately type checked. Implicit conversion is defined for numeric types , so one may validly multiply a complex number by an integer without explicit casting. However, there is no implicit conversion between, for example, numbers and strings; a string is an invalid argument to a mathematical function expecting a number.  Base types  Python has a broad range of basic data types. Alongside conventional integer and floating point arithmetic, it transparently supports arbitrary precision arithmetic, complex numbers, and decimal numbers. Python supports a wide variety of string operations. Strings in Python are immutable, so a string operation such as a substitution of characters, that in other programming languages might alter the string in place, returns a new string in Python. Performance considerations sometimes push for using special techniques in programs that modify strings intensively, such as joining character arrays into strings only as needed.  Collection types  One of the very useful aspects of Python is the concept of collection types. In general a collection is an object that contains other objects in a way that is easily referenced or indexed. Collections come in two basic forms: sequences and mappings. The ordered sequential types are lists , tuples, and strings. All sequences are indexed positionally and all but strings can contain any type of object, including multiple types in the same sequence. Both strings and tuples are immutable, making them perfect candidates for dictionary keys . Lists, on the other hand, are mutable; elements can be inserted, deleted, modified, appended, or sorted in place. Mappings, on the other hand, are types implemented in the form of dictionaries which map a set of immutable keys to corresponding elements . For example, one could define a dictionary having a string toast mapped to the integer 42 or vice versa. The keys in a dictionary must be of an immutable Python type, such as an integer or a string, because under the hood they are implemented via a hash function. This makes for much faster lookup times, but requires keys not change. Dictionaries are central to the internals of Python as they reside at the core of all objects and classes: the mappings between variable names and the values which the names reference are stored as dictionaries . Since these dictionaries are directly accessible , metaprogramming is a straightforward and natural process in Python. A set collection type is an unindexed, unordered collection that contains no duplicates, and implements set theoretic operations such as union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, and subset testing. There are two types of sets: set and frozenset, the only difference being that set is mutable and frozenset is immutable. Elements in a set must be hashable. Thus, for example, a frozenset can be an element of a regular set whereas the opposite is not true. Python also provides extensive collection manipulating abilities such as built in containment checking and a generic iteration protocol.  Object system  In Python, everything is an object, even classes. Classes, as objects, have a class, which is known as their metaclass. Python also supports multiple inheritance and mixins. The language supports extensive introspection of types and classes. Types can be read and compared types are instances of type. The attributes of an object can be extracted as a dictionary. Operators can be overloaded in Python by defining special member functions for instance, defining a method named add on a class permits one to use the operator on objects of that class.  Literals   Strings  Python has various kinds of string literals.  Normal string literals  Either single or double quotes can be used to quote strings. Unlike in Unix shell languages, Perl or Perl influenced languages such as Ruby or Groovy, single quotes and double quotes function identically, i.e. there is no string interpolation of foo expressions. However, interpolation can be done in various ways: with f strings , using the format method or the old string format operator. For instance, all of these Python statements:are equivalent to the Perl statement:They build a string using the variables num and printer.  Multi line string literals  There are also multi line strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotes and function like here documents in Perl and Ruby. A simple example with variable interpolation is:  Raw strings  Finally, all of the previously mentioned string types come in raw varieties , which do no backslash interpolation and hence are very useful for regular expressions; compare quoting in C . Raw strings were originally included specifically for regular expressions. Due to limitations of the tokenizer, raw strings may not have a trailing backslash. Creating a raw string holding a Windows path ending with a backslash requires some variety of workaround . Examples include:  Concatenation of adjacent string literals  String literals appearing contiguously and only separated by whitespace , are allowed and are aggregated into a single longer string. Thus is equivalent to  Unicode  Since Python 3.0, the default character set is UTF 8 both for source code and the interpreter. In UTF 8, unicode strings are handled like traditional byte strings. This example will work:  Numbers  Numeric literals in Python are of the normal sort, e.g. 0, 1, 3.4, 3.5e 8. Python has arbitrary length integers and automatically increases their storage size as necessary. Prior to Python 3, there were two kinds of integral numbers: traditional fixed size integers and long integers of arbitrary size. The conversion to long integers was performed automatically when required, and thus the programmer usually didn't have to be aware of the two integral types. In newer language versions the distinction is completely gone and all integers behave like arbitrary length integers. Python supports normal floating point numbers, which are created when a dot is used in a literal , when an integer and a floating point number are used in an expression, or as a result of some mathematical operations . Python also supports complex numbers natively. Complex numbers are indicated with the J or j suffix, e.g. 3 4j.  Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  Python has syntactic support for the creation of container types. Lists are mutable sequences of items of arbitrary types, and can be created either with the special syntax or using normal object creation Tuples are immutable sequences of items of arbitrary types. There is also a special syntax to create tuples Although tuples are created by separating items with commas, the whole construct is usually wrapped in parentheses to increase readability. An empty tuple is denoted by , while a tuple with a single value can be created with . Sets are mutable containers of hashable items of arbitrary types, with no duplicates. The items are not ordered, but sets support iteration over the items. The syntax for set creation uses curly brackets Python sets are very much like mathematical sets, and support operations like set intersection and union. Python also features a frozenset class for immutable sets, see Collection types. Dictionaries are mutable mappings tying keys and corresponding values. Python has special syntax to create dictionaries The dictionary syntax is similar to the set syntax, the difference is the presence of colons. The empty literal results in an empty dictionary rather than an empty set, which is instead created using the non literal constructor: set .  Operators   Arithmetic  Python includes the , , , ,  , , and  operators, with their usual mathematical precedence. In Python 3, x y performs true division , meaning that it always returns a float, even if both x and y are integers that divide evenly. and performs integer division or floor division, returning the floor of the quotient as an integer. In Python 2 , unless explicitly requested, x y performed integer division, returning a float only if either input was a float. However, because Python is a dynamically typed language, it was not always possible to tell which operation was being performed, which often led to subtle bugs, thus prompting the introduction of the operator and the change in semantics of the operator in Python 3.  Comparison operators  The comparison operators, i.e. , ! , , , , , is, is not, in and not in are used on all manner of values. Numbers, strings, sequences, and mappings can all be compared. In Python 3, disparate types do not have a consistent relative ordering. While it was possible to compare whether some string was greater than or less than some integer in Python 2, this was considered a historical design quirk and was ultimately removed in Python 3. Chained comparison expressions such as a b c have roughly the meaning that they have in mathematics, rather than the unusual meaning found in C and similar languages. The terms are evaluated and compared in order. The operation has short circuit semantics, meaning that evaluation is guaranteed to stop as soon as a verdict is clear: if a b is false, c is never evaluated as the expression cannot possibly be true anymore. For expressions without side effects, a b c is equivalent to a b and b c. However, there is a substantial difference when the expressions have side effects. a f b will evaluate f exactly once, whereas a f and f b will evaluate it twice if the value of a is less than f and once otherwise.  Logical operators  In all versions of Python, boolean operators treat zero values or empty values such as , 0, None, 0.0, , and as false, while in general treating non empty, non zero values as true. The boolean values True and False were added to the language in Python 2.2.1 as constants and were changed to be full blown keywords in Python 3. The binary comparison operators such as and return either True or False. The boolean operators and and or use minimal evaluation. For example, y 0 or x y 100 will never raise a divide by zero exception. These operators return the value of the last operand evaluated, rather than True or False. Thus the expression evaluates to 5, and evaluates to 4.  Functional programming As mentioned above, another strength of Python is the availability of a functional programming style. As may be expected, this makes working with lists and other collections much more straightforward.  Comprehensions  One such construction is the list comprehension, which can be expressed with the following format: Using list comprehension to calculate the first five powers of two: The Quicksort algorithm can be expressed elegantly using list comprehensions: Python 2.7 also supports set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.  First class functions  In Python, functions are first class objects that can be created and passed around dynamically. Python's limited support for anonymous functions is the lambda construct. An example is the anonymous function which squares its input, called with the argument of 5: Lambdas are limited to containing an expression rather than statements, although control flow can still be implemented less elegantly within lambda by using short circuiting, and more idiomatically with conditional expressions.  Closures  Python has had support for lexical closures since version 2.2. Here's an example function that returns a function that approximates the derivative of the given function: Python's syntax, though, sometimes leads programmers of other languages to think that closures are not supported. Variable scope in Python is implicitly determined by the scope in which one assigns a value to the variable, unless scope is explicitly declared with global or nonlocal.Note that the closure's binding of a name to some value is not mutable from within the function. Given: and you can see that b, as visible from the closure's scope, retains the value it had; the changed binding of b inside the inner function did not propagate out. The way around this is to use a nonlocal b statement in bar. In Python 2 , the usual workaround is to use a mutable value and change that value, not the binding. E.g., a list with one element.  Generators  Introduced in Python 2.2 as an optional feature and finalized in version 2.3, generators are Python's mechanism for lazy evaluation of a function that would otherwise return a space prohibitive or computationally intensive list. This is an example to lazily generate the prime numbers: When calling this function, the returned value can be iterated over much like a list: The definition of a generator appears identical to that of a function, except the keyword yield is used in place of return. However, a generator is an object with persistent state, which can repeatedly enter and leave the same scope. A generator call can then be used in place of a list, or other structure whose elements will be iterated over. Whenever the for loop in the example requires the next item, the generator is called, and yields the next item. Generators don't have to be infinite like the prime number example above. When a generator terminates, an internal exception is raised which indicates to any calling context that there are no more values. A for loop or other iteration will then terminate.  Generator expressions  Introduced in Python 2.4, generator expressions are the lazy evaluation equivalent of list comprehensions. Using the prime number generator provided in the above section, we might define a lazy, but not quite infinite collection. Most of the memory and time needed to generate this many primes will not be used until the needed element is actually accessed. Unfortunately, you cannot perform simple indexing and slicing of generators, but must use the itertools module or roll your own loops. In contrast, a list comprehension is functionally equivalent, but is greedy in performing all the work: The list comprehension will immediately create a large list , even if most elements are never accessed. The generator comprehension is more parsimonious.  Dictionary and set comprehensions  While lists and generators had comprehensions expressions, in Python versions older than 2.7 the other Python built in collection types had to be kludged in using lists or generators: Python 2.7 and 3.0 unified all collection types by introducing dictionary and set comprehensions, similar to list comprehensions:  Objects Python supports most object oriented programming techniques. It allows polymorphism, not only within a class hierarchy but also by duck typing. Any object can be used for any type, and it will work so long as it has the proper methods and attributes. And everything in Python is an object, including classes, functions, numbers and modules. Python also has support for metaclasses, an advanced tool for enhancing classes' functionality. Naturally, inheritance, including multiple inheritance, is supported. Python has very limited support for private variables using name mangling which is rarely used in practice as information hiding is seen by some as unpythonic, in that it suggests that the class in question contains unaesthetic or ill planned internals. The slogan we're all responsible users here is used to describe this attitude. As is true for modules, classes in Python do not put an absolute barrier between definition and user, but rather rely on the politeness of the user not to break into the definition. OOP doctrines such as the use of accessor methods to read data members are not enforced in Python. Just as Python offers functional programming constructs but does not attempt to demand referential transparency, it offers an object system but does not demand OOP behavior. Moreover, it is always possible to redefine the class using properties so that when a certain variable is set or retrieved in calling code, it really invokes a function call, so that spam.eggs toast might really invoke spam.set eggs . This nullifies the practical advantage of accessor functions, and it remains OOP because the property eggs becomes a legitimate part of the object's interface: it need not reflect an implementation detail. In version 2.2 of Python, new style classes were introduced. With new style classes, objects and types were unified, allowing the subclassing of types. Even entirely new types can be defined, complete with custom behavior for infix operators. This allows for many radical things to be done syntactically within Python. A new method resolution order for multiple inheritance was also adopted with Python 2.3. It is also possible to run custom code while accessing or setting attributes, though the details of those techniques have evolved between Python versions.  With statement  The with statement handles resources, and allows users to work with the Context Manager protocol. One function is called when entering scope and another when leaving. This prevents forgetting to free the resource and also handles more complicated situations such as freeing the resource when an exception occurs while it is in use. Context Managers are often used with files, database connections, test cases, etc.  Properties  Properties allow specially defined methods to be invoked on an object instance by using the same syntax as used for attribute access. An example of a class defining some properties is:  Descriptors  A class that defines one or more of the three special methods get , set , delete can be used as a descriptor. Creating an instance of a descriptor as a class member of a second class makes the instance a property of the second class.  Class and static methods  Python allows the creation of class methods and static methods via the use of the classmethod and staticmethod decorators. The first argument to a class method is the class object instead of the self reference to the instance. A static method has no special first argument. Neither the instance, nor the class object is passed to a static method.  Exceptions Python supports exception handling as a means of testing for error conditions and other exceptional events in a program. Python style calls for the use of exceptions whenever an error condition might arise. Rather than testing for access to a file or resource before actually using it, it is conventional in Python to just go ahead and try to use it, catching the exception if access is rejected. Exceptions can also be used as a more general means of non local transfer of control, even when an error is not at issue. For instance, the Mailman mailing list software, written in Python, uses exceptions to jump out of deeply nested message handling logic when a decision has been made to reject a message or hold it for moderator approval. Exceptions are often used as an alternative to the if block, especially in threaded situations. A commonly invoked motto is EAFP, or It is Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission, which is attributed to Grace Hopper. The alternative, known as LBYL, or Look Before You Leap , explicitly tests for pre conditions.In this first code sample, following the LBYL approach, there is an explicit check for the attribute before access: This second sample follows the EAFP paradigm: These two code samples have the same effect, although there will be performance differences. When spam has the attribute eggs, the EAFP sample will run faster. When spam does not have the attribute eggs , the EAFP sample will run slower. The Python profiler can be used in specific cases to determine performance characteristics. If exceptional cases are rare, then the EAFP version will have superior average performance than the alternative. In addition, it avoids the whole class of time of check to time of use vulnerabilities, other race conditions, and is compatible with duck typing. A drawback of EAFP is that it can be used only with statements; an exception cannot be caught in a generator expression, list comprehension, or lambda function.  Comments and docstrings Python has two ways to annotate Python code. One is by using comments to indicate what some part of the code does. Single line comments begin with the hash character and continue until the end of the line. Comments spanning more than one line are achieved by inserting a multi line string that is not used in assignment or otherwise evaluated, but sits in between other statements. Commenting a piece of code: Commenting a piece of code with multiple lines: Docstrings , that is, strings that are located alone without assignment as the first indented line within a module, class, method or function, automatically set their contents as an attribute named doc , which is intended to store a human readable description of the object's purpose, behavior, and usage. The built in help function generates its output based on doc attributes. Such strings can be delimited with or ' for single line strings, or may span multiple lines if delimited with either  or ''' which is Python's notation for specifying multi line strings. However, the style guide for the language specifies that triple double quotes are preferred for both single and multi line docstrings.Single line docstring: Multi line docstring: Docstrings can be as large as the programmer wants and contain line breaks. In contrast with comments, docstrings are themselves Python objects and are part of the interpreted code that Python runs. That means that a running program can retrieve its own docstrings and manipulate that information, but the normal usage is to give other programmers information about how to invoke the object being documented in the docstring. There are tools available that can extract the docstrings from Python code and generate documentation. Docstring documentation can also be accessed from the interpreter with the help function, or from the shell with the pydoc command pydoc. The doctest standard module uses interactions copied from Python shell sessions into docstrings to create tests, whereas the docopt module uses them to define command line options.  Function annotations Function annotations are defined in PEP 3107. They allow attaching data to the arguments and return of a function. The behaviour of annotations is not defined by the language, and is left to third party frameworks. For example, a library could be written to handle static typing:  Decorators  A decorator is any callable Python object that is used to modify a function, method or class definition. A decorator is passed the original object being defined and returns a modified object, which is then bound to the name in the definition. Python decorators were inspired in part by Java annotations, and have a similar syntax; the decorator syntax is pure syntactic sugar, using as the keyword: is equivalent to Decorators are a form of metaprogramming; they enhance the action of the function or method they decorate. For example, in the sample below, viking chorus might cause menu item to be run 8 times for each time it is called: Canonical uses of function decorators are for creating class methods or static methods, adding function attributes, tracing, setting pre and postconditions, and synchronization, but can be used for far more, including tail recursion elimination, memoization and even improving the writing of other decorators.Decorators can be chained by placing several on adjacent lines: is equivalent to or, using intermediate variables In the example above, the favourite colour decorator factory takes an argument. Decorator factories must return a decorator, which is then called with the object to be decorated as its argument: This would then decorate the black knight function such that the colour, Blue , would be printed prior to the black knight function running. Closure ensures that the colour argument is accessible to the innermost wrapper function even when it is returned and goes out of scope, which is what allows decorators to work. Despite the name, Python decorators are not an implementation of the decorator pattern. The decorator pattern is a design pattern used in statically typed object oriented programming languages to allow functionality to be added to objects at run time; Python decorators add functionality to functions and methods at definition time, and thus are a higher level construct than decorator pattern classes. The decorator pattern itself is trivially implementable in Python, because the language is duck typed, and so is not usually considered as such.  Easter eggs Users of curly bracket languages, such as C or Java, sometimes expect or wish Python to follow a block delimiter convention. Brace delimited block syntax has been repeatedly requested, and consistently rejected by core developers. The Python interpreter contains an easter egg that summarizes its developers' feelings on this issue. The code from future import braces raises the exception SyntaxError: not a chance. The future module is normally used to provide features from future versions of Python. Another hidden message, the Zen of Python , is displayed when trying to import this. The message Hello world! is printed when the import statement import hello is used. In Python 2.7, instead of Hello world! it prints Hello world.... Importing the antigravity module opens a web browser to xkcd comic 353 that portrays a humorous fictional use for such a module, intended to demonstrate the ease with which Python modules enable additional functionality. In Python 3, this module also contains an implementation of the geohash algorithm, a reference to xkcd comic 426.

            "text": "Python is a high level, general purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured , object oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.  History  Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde Informatica in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python's benevolent dictator for life , a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long term commitment as the project's chief decision maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five member Steering Council to lead the project.Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.Python 2.7's end of life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end of life, only Python 3.6.x and later were supported. Later, support for 3.6 was also discontinued. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python had security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and so were older releases including 3.8.13, and 3.7.13 because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial of service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.  Design philosophy and features Python is a multi paradigm programming language. Object oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect oriented programming . Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution , which binds method and variable names during program execution. Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.Its core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python , which includes aphorisms such as: Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Readability counts.Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.Python strives for a simpler, less cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's there is more than one way to do it motto, Python embraces a there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture. Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C; or use PyPy, a just in time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C level API calls into the Python interpreter. Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.The programming language's name 'Python' came from the BBC Comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. Guido van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique and slightly mysterious, And so, he decided to name the programming language 'Python'.A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. Pythonic code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.Python users and admirers, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.  Syntax and semantics  Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.  Indentation  Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.  Statements and control flow  Python's statements include: The assignment statement, using a single equals sign The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses ; it also ensures that clean up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re raise a caught exception The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object oriented programming The def statement, which defines a function or method The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager , allowing resource acquisition is initialization like behavior and replacing a common try finally idiom The break statement, which exits a loop The continue statement, which skips the current iteration and continues with the next The del statement, which removes a variable deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined The pass statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function ; used to implement coroutines The return statement, used to return a value from a function The import statement, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current programThe assignment statement binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing in contrast to statically typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type. Python does not support tail call optimization or first class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.  Expressions  Some Python expressions are similar to those in languages such as C and Java, while some are not: Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division  and floating point division. Python also uses the operator for exponentiation. The infix operator. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication. The syntax : , called the walrus operator , was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. In Python, compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities , and comparisons may be chained for example, a b c. Python uses and, or, and not as boolean operators rather than the symbolic , , ! in Java and C. Python has a type of expression called a list comprehension, as well as a more general expression called a generator expression. Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body. Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y . Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as 1, 2, 3 , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries . Tuples, written as , are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to , executing t t  first evaluates t , which yields , which is then assigned back to t thereby effectively modifying the contents of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts. Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left. Python has a string format operator that functions analogously to printf format strings in C e.g. spam s eggs d  evaluates to spam blah eggs 2 . In Python 2.6 and 3 , this was supplemented by the format method of the str class, e.g. spam 0 eggs 1 .format . Python 3.6 added f strings : spam blah ; eggs 2; f'spam spam eggs eggs '. Strings in Python can be concatenated by adding them , e.g. spam  eggs returns spameggs . If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. 2  2 returns 22 . Python has various string literals: Delimited by single or double quote marks; unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl influenced languages, single and double quote marks work the same. Both use the backslash as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as formatted string literals . Triple quoted , which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby. Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows style paths. Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, denoted as a key , a start:stop or a start:stop:step . Indexes are zero based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted for example, a : returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example: List comprehensions vs. for loops Conditional expressions vs. if blocks The eval vs. exec built in functions ; the former is for expressions, the latter is for statementsStatements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as a 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator for an equality operator in conditions: if  ... is syntactically valid C code, but if c 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.  Methods  Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method . Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self in some other object oriented programming languages . Python also provides methods, often called dunder methods , to allow user defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.  Typing  Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well defined rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class or EggsClass , and the classes are instances of the metaclass type , allowing metaprogramming and reflection. Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes : old style and new style, current Python versions only support the semantics new style. The long term plan is to support gradual typing. Python's syntax allows specifying static types, but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker, mypy, supports compile time type checking.  Arithmetic operations  Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators , the floor division operator and the modulo operation . It also has for exponentiation, e.g. 5 3 125 and 9 0.5 3.0, and a matrix multiplication operator . These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix . The division between integers produces floating point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time: Current Python changed to always be floating point division, e.g. 5 2 2.5. The floor division operator was introduced. So 7 3 2, 7 3  3, 7.5 3 2.0 and 7.5 3  3.0. Adding from future import division causes a module used in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division .In Python terms, is true division , and is floor division. before version 3.0 is classic division.Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation b a b 1 is always true. It also means that the equation b  a b a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a b is, as expected, in the half open interval 0, b , where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval and round both produce 2. Versions before 3 used round away from zero: round is 1.0, round is 1.0.Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a b c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.Python uses arbitrary precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type class in the decimal module provides decimal floating point numbers to a pre defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.  Programming examples Hello world program: Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:  Libraries Python's large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks, and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing. Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333 but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations. As of June 2022, the Python Package Index , the official repository for third party Python software, contains over 380,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:  Development environments  Most Python implementations include a read eval print loop , permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately. Python also comes with an Integrated development environment called IDLE, which is more beginner oriented. Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting. As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser based IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science and math related programs; PythonAnywhere, a browser based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing.  Implementations   Reference implementation  CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard with several select C99 features It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix like systems, including macOS and unofficial support for e.g. VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.   Other implementations  PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.8. Its just in time compiler often brings a significant speed improvement over CPython but some libraries written in C cannot be used with it. Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version. MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3. Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just in time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs. Cinder is a performance oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method at a time JIT and an experimental bytecode compiler.  Unsupported implementations  Other just in time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported: Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock. Psyco is a discontinued just in time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later. PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.  Cross compilers to other languages  There are several compilers to high level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language: Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs compile Python to JavaScript. Cython compiles Python 2.7 to C . Nuitka compiles Python into C. Numba uses LLVM to compile a subset of Python to machine code. Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C . RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python. The Python 11l C transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C .Specialized: MyHDL is a Python based hardware description language , that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.Older projects : Google's Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go. IronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime. Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program. Pyrex and Shed Skin compile to C and C respectively.  Performance  Performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non numerical workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13. Python's performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.  Development Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self hosted source code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: Backward incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen. Major or feature releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to happen annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release. Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.Many alpha, beta, and release candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as Pyladies. Python 3.10 deprecated wstr , and added pattern matching to the language.  API documentation generators Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc , Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.  Naming Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.The prefix Py is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python ; PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python.  Popularity Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of October 2021, it is the most popular language . It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 .An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often better than Java and not much worse than C or C .Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.  Uses  Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod wsgi for the Apache webserver. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client side of Ajax based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used by Dropbox. Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, and Scikit learn. As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.Python can also be used to create games, with libraries such as Pygame, which can make 2D games. Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 , FreeBSD , NetBSD, and OpenBSD and can be used from the command line . Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage. Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single board computer project has adopted Python as its main user programming language. LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.  Languages influenced by Python Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages: Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its Acknowledgements document lists Python first among languages that influenced it. CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross compiles to JavaScript, has Python inspired syntax. ECMAScript JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python. GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built in to the Godot game engine. Go is designed for the speed of working in a dynamic language like Python and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays. Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java. Julia was designed to be as usable for general programming as Python . Nim uses indentation and similar syntax. Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language. Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python inspired syntax.Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language is also used in Tcl, Erlang, and Swift.

            "text": "Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects , which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields , and code, in the form of procedures . A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or self used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely used programming languages are multi paradigm and they support object oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object oriented languages include: Java, C , C , Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, SIMSCRIPT, Object Pascal, Objective C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.  History  Terminology invoking objects and oriented in the modern sense of object oriented programming made its first appearance at MIT in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the environment of the artificial intelligence group, as early as 1960, object could refer to identified items with properties ;Alan Kay later cited a detailed understanding of LISP internals as a strong influence on his thinking in 1966. Another early MIT example was Sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland in 1960 1961; in the glossary of the 1963 technical report based on his dissertation about Sketchpad, Sutherland defined notions of object and instance , albeit specialized to graphical interaction. Also, an MIT ALGOL version, AED 0, established a direct link between data structures and procedures, prefiguring what were later termed messages , methods , and member functions .Simula introduced important concepts that are today an essential part of object oriented programming, such as class and object, inheritance, and dynamic binding. The object oriented Simula programming language was used mainly by researchers involved with physical modelling, such as models to study and improve the movement of ships and their content through cargo ports.In the 1970s, the first version of the Smalltalk programming language was developed at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg. Smalltalk 72 included a programming environment and was dynamically typed, and at first was interpreted, not compiled. Smalltalk became noted for its application of object orientation at the language level and its graphical development environment. Smalltalk went through various versions and interest in the language grew. While Smalltalk was influenced by the ideas introduced in Simula 67 it was designed to be a fully dynamic system in which classes could be created and modified dynamically.In the 1970s, Smalltalk influenced the Lisp community to incorporate object based techniques that were introduced to developers via the Lisp machine. Experimentation with various extensions to Lisp eventually led to the Common Lisp Object System, which integrates functional programming and object oriented programming and allows extension via a Meta object protocol. In the 1980s, there were a few attempts to design processor architectures that included hardware support for objects in memory but these were not successful. Examples include the Intel iAPX 432 and the Linn Smart Rekursiv. In 1981, Goldberg edited the August issue of Byte Magazine, introducing Smalltalk and object oriented programming to a wider audience. In 1986, the Association for Computing Machinery organised the first Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications , which was unexpectedly attended by 1,000 people. In the mid 1980s Objective C was developed by Brad Cox, who had used Smalltalk at ITT Inc., and Bjarne Stroustrup, who had used Simula for his PhD thesis, eventually went to create the object oriented C . In 1985, Bertrand Meyer also produced the first design of the Eiffel language. Focused on software quality, Eiffel is a purely object oriented programming language and a notation supporting the entire software lifecycle. Meyer described the Eiffel software development method, based on a small number of key ideas from software engineering and computer science, in Object Oriented Software Construction. Essential to the quality focus of Eiffel is Meyer's reliability mechanism, Design by Contract, which is an integral part of both the method and language. In the early and mid 1990s object oriented programming developed as the dominant programming paradigm when programming languages supporting the techniques became widely available. These included Visual FoxPro 3.0, C , and Delphi. Its dominance was further enhanced by the rising popularity of graphical user interfaces, which rely heavily upon object oriented programming techniques. An example of a closely related dynamic GUI library and OOP language can be found in the Cocoa frameworks on Mac OS X, written in Objective C, an object oriented, dynamic messaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also enhanced the popularity of event driven programming . At ETH Z rich, Niklaus Wirth and his colleagues had also been investigating such topics as data abstraction and modular programming . Modula 2 included both, and their succeeding design, Oberon, included a distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such. Object oriented features have been added to many previously existing languages, including Ada, BASIC, Fortran, Pascal, and COBOL. Adding these features to languages that were not initially designed for them often led to problems with compatibility and maintainability of code. More recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily object oriented, but that are also compatible with procedural methodology. Two such languages are Python and Ruby. Probably the most commercially important recent object oriented languages are Java, developed by Sun Microsystems, as well as C and Visual Basic.NET , both designed for Microsoft's .NET platform. Each of these two frameworks shows, in its own way, the benefit of using OOP by creating an abstraction from implementation. VB.NET and C support cross language inheritance, allowing classes defined in one language to subclass classes defined in the other language.  Features Object oriented programming uses objects, but not all of the associated techniques and structures are supported directly in languages that claim to support OOP. It performs operations on operands. The features listed below are common among languages considered to be strongly class and object oriented , with notable exceptions mentioned.  Shared with non OOP languages  Variables that can store information formatted in a small number of built in data types like integers and alphanumeric characters. This may include data structures like strings, lists, and hash tables that are either built in or result from combining variables using memory pointers. Procedures also known as functions, methods, routines, or subroutines that take input, generate output, and manipulate data. Modern languages include structured programming constructs like loops and conditionals.Modular programming support provides the ability to group procedures into files and modules for organizational purposes. Modules are namespaced so identifiers in one module will not conflict with a procedure or variable sharing the same name in another file or module.  Objects and classes  Languages that support object oriented programming typically use inheritance for code reuse and extensibility in the form of either classes or prototypes. Those that use classes support two main concepts: Classes the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions Objects instances of classesObjects sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as circle , square , menu . An online shopping system might have objects such as shopping cart , customer , and product . Sometimes objects represent more abstract entities, like an object that represents an open file, or an object that provides the service of translating measurements from U.S. customary to metric. Each object is said to be an instance of a particular class . Procedures in object oriented programming are known as methods; variables are also known as fields, members, attributes, or properties. This leads to the following terms: Class variables belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one Instance variables or attributes data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one Member variables refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class Class methods belong to the class as a whole and have access to only class variables and inputs from the procedure call Instance methods belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variablesObjects are accessed somewhat like variables with complex internal structure, and in many languages are effectively pointers, serving as actual references to a single instance of said object in memory within a heap or stack. They provide a layer of abstraction which can be used to separate internal from external code. External code can use an object by calling a specific instance method with a certain set of input parameters, read an instance variable, or write to an instance variable. Objects are created by calling a special type of method in the class known as a constructor. A program may create many instances of the same class as it runs, which operate independently. This is an easy way for the same procedures to be used on different sets of data. Object oriented programming that uses classes is sometimes called class based programming, while prototype based programming does not typically use classes. As a result, significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to define the concepts of object and instance. In some languages classes and objects can be composed using other concepts like traits and mixins.  Class based vs prototype based  In class based languages the classes are defined beforehand and the objects are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects apple and orange are instantiated from the class Fruit, they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as color or sugar content or is ripe. In prototype based languages the objects are the primary entities. No classes even exist. The prototype of an object is just another object to which the object is linked. Every object has one prototype link . New objects can be created based on already existing objects chosen as their prototype. You may call two different objects apple and orange a fruit, if the object fruit exists, and both apple and orange have fruit as their prototype. The idea of the fruit class doesn't exist explicitly, but as the equivalence class of the objects sharing the same prototype. The attributes and methods of the prototype are delegated to all the objects of the equivalence class defined by this prototype. The attributes and methods owned individually by the object may not be shared by other objects of the same equivalence class; e.g. the attribute sugar content may be unexpectedly not present in apple. Only single inheritance can be implemented through the prototype.  Dynamic dispatch message passing  It is the responsibility of the object, not any external code, to select the procedural code to execute in response to a method call, typically by looking up the method at run time in a table associated with the object. This feature is known as dynamic dispatch. If the call variability relies on more than the single type of the object on which it is called , one speaks of multiple dispatch. A method call is also known as message passing. It is conceptualized as a message being passed to the object for dispatch.  Data Abstraction  Data Abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions, so as to prevent misuse. The success of data abstraction leads to frequent incorporation of data hiding as a design principle in object oriented and pure functional programming. If a class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only, this is a form of information hiding known as abstraction. Some languages let classes enforce access restrictions explicitly, for example denoting internal data with the private keyword and designating methods intended for use by code outside the class with the public keyword. Methods may also be designed public, private, or intermediate levels such as protected . In other languages this is enforced only by convention .  Encapsulation  Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. This facilitates code refactoring, for example allowing the author of the class to change how objects of that class represent their data internally without changing any external code . It also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling.  Composition, inheritance, and delegation  Objects can contain other objects in their instance variables; this is known as object composition. For example, an object in the Employee class might contain an object in the Address class, in addition to its own instance variables like first name and position . Object composition is used to represent has a relationships: every employee has an address, so every Employee object has access to a place to store an Address object . Languages that support classes almost always support inheritance. This allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchy that represents is a type of relationships. For example, class Employee might inherit from class Person. All the data and methods available to the parent class also appear in the child class with the same names. For example, class Person might define variables first name and last name with method make full name . These will also be available in class Employee, which might add the variables position and salary . This technique allows easy re use of the same procedures and data definitions, in addition to potentially mirroring real world relationships in an intuitive way. Rather than utilizing database tables and programming subroutines, the developer utilizes objects the user may be more familiar with: objects from their application domain.Subclasses can override the methods defined by superclasses. Multiple inheritance is allowed in some languages, though this can make resolving overrides complicated. Some languages have special support for mixins, though in any language with multiple inheritance, a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is a type of relationship. Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes. For example, class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method unicode to ascii when included in class FileReader and class WebPageScraper, which don't share a common parent. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated into objects; they exist only for the purpose of inheritance into other concrete classes that can be instantiated. In Java, the final keyword can be used to prevent a class from being subclassed. The doctrine of composition over inheritance advocates implementing has a relationships using composition instead of inheritance. For example, instead of inheriting from class Person, class Employee could give each Employee object an internal Person object, which it then has the opportunity to hide from external code even if class Person has many public attributes or methods. Some languages, like Go do not support inheritance at all. The open closed principle advocates that classes and functions should be open for extension, but closed for modification . Delegation is another language feature that can be used as an alternative to inheritance.  Polymorphism  Subtyping a form of polymorphism is when calling code can be independent of which class in the supported hierarchy it is operating on the parent class or one of its descendants. Meanwhile, the same operation name among objects in an inheritance hierarchy may behave differently. For example, objects of type Circle and Square are derived from a common class called Shape. The Draw function for each type of Shape implements what is necessary to draw itself while calling code can remain indifferent to the particular type of Shape being drawn. This is another type of abstraction that simplifies code external to the class hierarchy and enables strong separation of concerns.  Open recursion  In languages that support open recursion, object methods can call other methods on the same object , typically using a special variable or keyword called this or self. This variable is late bound; it allows a method defined in one class to invoke another method that is defined later, in some subclass thereof.  OOP languages  Simula is generally accepted as being the first language with the primary features of an object oriented language. It was created for making simulation programs, in which what came to be called objects were the most important information representation. Smalltalk is another early example, and the one with which much of the theory of OOP was developed. Concerning the degree of object orientation, the following distinctions can be made: Languages called pure OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Emerald, JADE, Self, Raku. Languages designed mainly for OO programming, but with some procedural elements. Examples: Java, Python, C , C , Delphi Object Pascal, VB.NET. Languages that are historically procedural languages, but have been extended with some OO features. Examples: PHP, Perl, Visual Basic , MATLAB, COBOL 2002, Fortran 2003, ABAP, Ada 95, Pascal. Languages with most of the features of objects , but in a distinctly original form. Examples: Oberon . Languages with abstract data type support which may be used to resemble OO programming, but without all features of object orientation. This includes object based and prototype based languages. Examples: JavaScript, Lua, Modula 2, CLU. Chameleon languages that support multiple paradigms, including OO. Tcl stands out among these for TclOO, a hybrid object system that supports both prototype based programming and class based OO.  OOP in dynamic languages  In recent years, object oriented programming has become especially popular in dynamic programming languages. Python, PowerShell, Ruby and Groovy are dynamic languages built on OOP principles, while Perl and PHP have been adding object oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and ColdFusion since version 6. The Document Object Model of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents on the Internet has bindings to the popular JavaScript ECMAScript language. JavaScript is perhaps the best known prototype based programming language, which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting from a class . Another scripting language that takes this approach is Lua.  OOP in a network protocol  The messages that flow between computers to request services in a client server environment can be designed as the linearizations of objects defined by class objects known to both the client and the server. For example, a simple linearized object would consist of a length field, a code point identifying the class, and a data value. A more complex example would be a command consisting of the length and code point of the command and values consisting of linearized objects representing the command's parameters. Each such command must be directed by the server to an object whose class recognizes the command and is able to provide the requested service. Clients and servers are best modeled as complex object oriented structures. Distributed Data Management Architecture took this approach and used class objects to define objects at four levels of a formal hierarchy: Fields defining the data values that form messages, such as their length, code point and data values. Objects and collections of objects similar to what would be found in a Smalltalk program for messages and parameters. Managers similar to IBM i Objects, such as a directory to files and files consisting of metadata and records. Managers conceptually provide memory and processing resources for their contained objects. A client or server consisting of all the managers necessary to implement a full processing environment, supporting such aspects as directory services, security and concurrency control.The initial version of DDM defined distributed file services. It was later extended to be the foundation of Distributed Relational Database Architecture .  Design patterns Challenges of object oriented design are addressed by several approaches. Most common is known as the design patterns codified by Gamma et al.. More broadly, the term design patterns can be used to refer to any general, repeatable, solution pattern to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of these commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions particular to object oriented development.  Inheritance and behavioral subtyping  It is intuitive to assume that inheritance creates a semantic is a relationship, and thus to infer that objects instantiated from subclasses can always be safely used instead of those instantiated from the superclass. This intuition is unfortunately false in most OOP languages, in particular in all those that allow mutable objects. Subtype polymorphism as enforced by the type checker in OOP languages cannot guarantee behavioral subtyping in any context. Behavioral subtyping is undecidable in general, so it cannot be implemented by a program . Class or object hierarchies must be carefully designed, considering possible incorrect uses that cannot be detected syntactically. This issue is known as the Liskov substitution principle.  Gang of Four design patterns  Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software is an influential book published in 1994 by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, often referred to humorously as the Gang of Four . Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming problems and patterns for solving them. As of April 2007, the book was in its 36th printing. The book describes the following patterns: Creational patterns : Factory method pattern, Abstract factory pattern, Singleton pattern, Builder pattern, Prototype pattern Structural patterns : Adapter pattern, Bridge pattern, Composite pattern, Decorator pattern, Facade pattern, Flyweight pattern, Proxy pattern Behavioral patterns : Chain of responsibility pattern, Command pattern, Interpreter pattern, Iterator pattern, Mediator pattern, Memento pattern, Observer pattern, State pattern, Strategy pattern, Template method pattern, Visitor pattern  Object orientation and databases  Both object oriented programming and relational database management systems are extremely common in software today. Since relational databases don't store objects directly , there is a general need to bridge the two worlds. The problem of bridging object oriented programming accesses and data patterns with relational databases is known as object relational impedance mismatch. There are a number of approaches to cope with this problem, but no general solution without downsides. One of the most common approaches is object relational mapping, as found in IDE languages such as Visual FoxPro and libraries such as Java Data Objects and Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord. There are also object databases that can be used to replace RDBMSs, but these have not been as technically and commercially successful as RDBMSs.  Real world modeling and relationships  OOP can be used to associate real world objects and processes with digital counterparts. However, not everyone agrees that OOP facilitates direct real world mapping or that real world mapping is even a worthy goal; Bertrand Meyer argues in Object Oriented Software Construction that a program is not a model of the world but a model of some part of the world; Reality is a cousin twice removed . At the same time, some principal limitations of OOP have been noted. For example, the circle ellipse problem is difficult to handle using OOP's concept of inheritance. However, Niklaus Wirth said of OOP in his paper, Good Ideas through the Looking Glass , This paradigm closely reflects the structure of systems 'in the real world', and it is therefore well suited to model complex systems with complex behaviours . Steve Yegge and others noted that natural languages lack the OOP approach of strictly prioritizing things before actions . This problem may cause OOP to suffer more convoluted solutions than procedural programming.  OOP and control flow  OOP was developed to increase the reusability and maintainability of source code. Transparent representation of the control flow had no priority and was meant to be handled by a compiler. With the increasing relevance of parallel hardware and multithreaded coding, developing transparent control flow becomes more important, something hard to achieve with OOP.  Responsibility vs. data driven design  Responsibility driven design defines classes in terms of a contract, that is, a class should be defined around a responsibility and the information that it shares. This is contrasted by Wirfs Brock and Wilkerson with data driven design, where classes are defined around the data structures that must be held. The authors hold that responsibility driven design is preferable.  SOLID and GRASP guidelines  SOLID is a mnemonic invented by Michael Feathers which spells out five software engineering design principles: Single responsibility principle Open closed principle Liskov substitution principle Interface segregation principle Dependency inversion principleGRASP is another set of guidelines advocated by Craig Larman.  Criticism The OOP paradigm has been criticised for a number of reasons, including not meeting its stated goals of reusability and modularity, and for overemphasizing one aspect of software design and modeling at the expense of other important aspects .Luca Cardelli has claimed that OOP code is intrinsically less efficient than procedural code, that OOP can take longer to compile, and that OOP languages have extremely poor modularity properties with respect to class extension and modification , and tend to be extremely complex. The latter point is reiterated by Joe Armstrong, the principal inventor of Erlang, who is quoted as saying: The problem with object oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. A study by Potok et al. has shown no significant difference in productivity between OOP and procedural approaches.Christopher J. Date stated that critical comparison of OOP to other technologies, relational in particular, is difficult because of lack of an agreed upon and rigorous definition of OOP; however, Date and Darwen have proposed a theoretical foundation on OOP that uses OOP as a kind of customizable type system to support RDBMS.In an article Lawrence Krubner claimed that compared to other languages OOP languages have no unique strengths, and inflict a heavy burden of unneeded complexity.Alexander Stepanov compares object orientation unfavourably to generic programming: I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. Paul Graham has suggested that OOP's popularity within large companies is due to large groups of mediocre programmers . According to Graham, the discipline imposed by OOP prevents any one programmer from doing too much damage .Leo Brodie has suggested a connection between the standalone nature of objects and a tendency to duplicate code in violation of the don't repeat yourself principle of software development. Steve Yegge noted that, as opposed to functional programming: Object Oriented Programming puts the Nouns first and foremost. Why would you go to such lengths to put one part of speech on a pedestal? Why should one kind of concept take precedence over another? It's not as if OOP has suddenly made verbs less important in the way we actually think. It's a strangely skewed perspective. Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure, described object systems as overly simplistic models of the real world. He emphasized the inability of OOP to model time properly, which is getting increasingly problematic as software systems become more concurrent.Eric S. Raymond, a Unix programmer and open source software advocate, has been critical of claims that present object oriented programming as the One True Solution , and has written that object oriented programming languages tend to encourage thickly layered programs that destroy transparency. Raymond compares this unfavourably to the approach taken with Unix and the C programming language.Rob Pike, a programmer involved in the creation of UTF 8 and Go, has called object oriented programming the Roman numerals of computing and has said that OOP languages frequently shift the focus from data structures and algorithms to types. Furthermore, he cites an instance of a Java professor whose idiomatic solution to a problem was to create six new classes, rather than to simply use a lookup table.Regarding inheritance, Bob Martin states that because they are software, related classes do not necessarily share the relationships of the things they represent.  Formal semantics  Objects are the run time entities in an object oriented system. They may represent a person, a place, a bank account, a table of data, or any item that the program has to handle. There have been several attempts at formalizing the concepts used in object oriented programming. The following concepts and constructs have been used as interpretations of OOP concepts: co algebraic data types recursive types encapsulated state inheritance records are basis for understanding objects if function literals can be stored in fields , but the actual calculi need be considerably more complex to incorporate essential features of OOP. Several extensions of System F : that deal with mutable objects have been studied; these allow both subtype polymorphism and parametric polymorphism Attempts to find a consensus definition or theory behind objects have not proven very successful , and often diverge widely. For example, some definitions focus on mental activities, and some on program structuring. One of the simpler definitions is that OOP is the act of using map data structures or arrays that can contain functions and pointers to other maps, all with some syntactic and scoping sugar on top. Inheritance can be performed by cloning the maps .

            "text": "R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is used among data miners, bioinformaticians and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software. Users have created packages to augment the functions of the R language. According to user surveys and studies of scholarly literature databases, R is one of the most commonly used programming languages used in data mining. As of October 2022, R ranks 12th in the TIOBE index, a measure of programming language popularity, in which the language peaked in 8th place in August 2020.The official R software environment is an open source free software environment within the GNU package, available under the GNU General Public License. It is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself . Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems. R has a command line interface. Multiple third party graphical user interfaces are also available, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface.  History R is an open source implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics from Scheme, which allow objects to be defined in predetermined blocks rather than the entirety of the code. S was created by Rick Becker, John Chambers, Doug Dunn, Jean McRae, and Judy Schilling at Bell Labs around 1976. Designed for statistical analysis, the language is an interpreted language whose code could be directly run without a compiler. Many programs written for S run unaltered in R. As a dialect of the Lisp language, Scheme was created by Gerald J. Sussman and Guy L. Steele Jr. at MIT around 1975.In 1991, statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, embarked on an S implementation. It was named partly after the first names of the first two R authors and partly as a play on the name of S. They began publicizing it on the data archive StatLib and the s news mailing list in August 1993. In 1995, statistician Martin M chler convinced Ihaka and Gentleman to make R free and open source software under the GNU General Public License. The first official release came in June 1995. The first official stable beta version was released on 29 February 2000.The Comprehensive R Archive Network was officially announced on 23 April 1997. CRAN stores R's executable files, source code, documentations, as well as packages contributed by users. CRAN originally had 3 mirrors and 12 contributed packages. As of January 2022, it has 101 mirrors and 18,728 contributed packages. In addition to hosting packages CRAN hosts binaries for major distributions of Linux, MacOS and Windows.The R Core Team was formed in 1997 to further develop the language. As of January 2022, it consists of Chambers, Gentleman, Ihaka, and M chler, plus statisticians Douglas Bates, Peter Dalgaard, Kurt Hornik, Michael Lawrence, Friedrich Leisch, Uwe Ligges, Thomas Lumley, Sebastian Meyer, Paul Murrell, Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley, Deepayan Sarkar, Duncan Temple Lang, Luke Tierney, and Simon Urbanek, as well as computer scientist Tomas Kalibera. Stefano Iacus, Guido Masarotto, Heiner Schwarte, Seth Falcon, Martin Morgan, and Duncan Murdoch were members. In April 2003, the R Foundation was founded as a non profit organization to provide further support for the R project.  Features   Data processing  R's data structures include vectors, arrays, lists, and data frames. Vectors are ordered collections of values and can be mapped to arrays of one or more dimensions in a column major order. That is, given an ordered collection of dimensions, one fills in values along the first dimension first, then fill in one dimensional arrays across the second dimension, and so on. R supports array arithmetics and in this regard is like languages such as APL and MATLAB. The special case of an array with two dimensions is called a matrix. Lists serve as collections of objects that do not necessarily have the same data type. Data frames contain a list of vectors of the same length, plus a unique set of row names. R has no scalar data type. Instead, a scalar is represented as a length one vector.R and its libraries implement various statistical techniques, including linear, generalized linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, spatial and time series analysis, classification, clustering, and others. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C , and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Another of R's strengths is static graphics; it can produce publication quality graphs that include mathematical symbols.  Programming  R is an interpreted language; users can access it through a command line interpreter. If a user types 2 2 at the R command prompt and presses enter, the computer replies with 4. R supports procedural programming with functions and, for some functions, object oriented programming with generic functions. Due to its S heritage, R has stronger object oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages. Extending it is facilitated by its lexical scoping rules, which are derived from Scheme. R uses S expressions to represent both data and code. R's extensible object system includes objects for : regression models, time series and geo spatial coordinates. Advanced users can write C, C , Java, .NET or Python code to manipulate R objects directly.Functions are first class objects and can be manipulated in the same way as data objects, facilitating meta programming that allows multiple dispatch. Function arguments are passed by value, and are lazy that is to say, they are only evaluated when they are used, not when the function is called. A generic function acts differently depending on the classes of the arguments passed to it. In other words, the generic function dispatches the method implementation specific to that object's class. For example, R has a generic print function that can print almost every class of object in R with print . Many of R's standard functions are written in R, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. R is highly extensible through the use of packages for specific functions and specific applications.  Packages  R's capabilities are extended through user created packages, which offer statistical techniques, graphical devices, import export, reporting , etc. These packages and their easy installation and use has been cited as driving the language's widespread adoption in data science. The packaging system is also used by researchers to organize research data, code and report files in a systematic way for sharing and archiving.Multiple packages are included with the basic installation. Additional packages are available on CRAN, Bioconductor, R Forge, Omegahat, GitHub, and other repositories.The Task Views on the CRAN website lists packages in fields including Finance, Genetics, High Performance Computing, Machine Learning, Medical Imaging, Meta Analysis, Social Sciences and Spatial Statistics. R has been identified by the FDA as suitable for interpreting data from clinical research. Microsoft maintains a daily snapshot of CRAN that dates back to Sept. 17, 2014.Other R package resources include R Forge, a platform for the collaborative development of R packages. The Bioconductor project provides packages for genomic data analysis, including object oriented data handling and analysis tools for data from Affymetrix, cDNA microarray, and next generation high throughput sequencing methods.A group of packages called the Tidyverse, which can be considered a dialect of the R language, is increasingly popular among developers. It strives to provide a cohesive collection of functions to deal with common data science tasks, including data import, cleaning, transformation and visualisation . Dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages.R is one of 5 languages with an Apache Spark API, along with Scala, Java, Python, and SQL.  Milestones A list of changes in R releases is maintained in various news files at CRAN. Some highlights are listed below for several major releases.  Interfaces Various applications can be used to edit or run R code.Early developers preferred to run R via the command line console, succeeded by those who prefer an IDE. IDEs for R include R.app , Rattle GUI, R Commander, RKWard, RStudio, and Tinn R. R is also supported in multi purpose IDEs such as Eclipse via the StatET plugin, and Visual Studio via the R Tools for Visual Studio. Of these, RStudio is the most commonly used.Statistical frameworks which use R in the background include Jamovi and JASP. Editors that support R include Emacs, Vim , Kate, LyX, Notepad , Visual Studio Code, WinEdt, and Tinn R. Jupyter Notebook can also be configured to edit and run R code.R functionality is accessible from scripting languages including Python, Perl, Ruby, F , and Julia. Interfaces to other, high level programming languages, like Java and .NET C are available.  Implementations The main R implementation is written in R, C, and Fortran. Several other implementations aimed at improving speed or increasing extensibility. A closely related implementation is pqR by Radford M. Neal with improved memory management and support for automatic multithreading. Renjin and FastR are Java implementations of R for use in a Java Virtual Machine. CXXR, rho, and Riposte are implementations of R in C . Renjin, Riposte, and pqR attempt to improve performance by using multiple cores and deferred evaluation. Most of these alternative implementations are experimental and incomplete, with relatively few users, compared to the main implementation maintained by the R Development Core Team. TIBCO, who previous sold the commercial implementation S PLUS, built a runtime engine called TERR, which is part of Spotfire.Microsoft R Open is a fully compatible R distribution with modifications for multi threaded computations. As of 30 June 2021, Microsoft started to phase out MRO in favor of the CRAN distribution.  Communities R has local communities worldwide for users to network, share ideas, and learn.A growing number of R events bring users together, such as conferences , meetups, as well as R Ladies groups that promote gender diversity. The R Foundation taskforce focuses on women and other under represented groups.  useR! conferences The official annual gathering of R users is called useR! . The first such event was useR! 2004 in May 2004, Vienna, Austria. After skipping 2005, the useR! conference has been held annually, usually alternating between locations in Europe and North America. History: useR! 2006, Vienna, Austria useR! 2007, Ames, Iowa, US useR! 2008, Dortmund, Germany useR! 2009, Rennes, France useR! 2010, Gaithersburg, Maryland, US useR! 2011, Coventry, United Kingdom useR! 2012, Nashville, Tennessee, US useR! 2013, Albacete, Spain useR! 2014, Los Angeles, California, US useR! 2015, Aalborg, Denmark useR! 2016, Stanford, California, US useR! 2017, Brussels, Belgium useR! 2018, Brisbane, Australia useR! 2019, Toulouse, France useR! 2020, took place online due to COVID 19 pandemic useR! 2021, took place online due to COVID 19 pandemic useR! 2022, took place online due to COVID 19 pandemicThe dates and the location for the next useR! event is to be decided as of July 2022.  The R Journal The R Journal is an open access, refereed journal of the R project. It features short to medium length articles on the use and development of R, including packages, programming tips, CRAN news, and foundation news.  Comparison with alternatives R is comparable to popular commercial statistical packages such as SAS, SPSS, and Stata. One difference is that R is available at no charge under a free software license.In January 2009, the New York Times ran an article charting the growth of R, the reasons for its popularity among data scientists and the threat it poses to commercial statistical packages such as SAS. In June 2017 data scientist Robert Muenchen published a more in depth comparison between R and other software packages, The Popularity of Data Science Software .R is more procedural than either SAS or SPSS, both of which make heavy use of pre programmed procedures that are built in to the language environment and customized by parameters of each call. R generally processes data in memory, which limits its usefulness in processing larger files.  Commercial support  Although R is an open source project, some companies provide commercial support and extensions. In 2007, Richard Schultz, Martin Schultz, Steve Weston and Kirk Mettler founded Revolution Analytics to provide commercial support for Revolution R, their distribution of R, which includes components developed by the company. Major additional components include: ParallelR, the R Productivity Environment IDE, RevoScaleR , RevoDeployR, web services framework, and the ability for reading and writing data in the SAS file format. Revolution Analytics offers an R distribution designed to comply with established IQ OQ PQ criteria that enables clients in the pharmaceutical sector to validate their installation of REvolution R. In 2015, Microsoft Corporation acquired Revolution Analytics and integrated the R programming language into SQL Server, Power BI, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Cortana Intelligence, Microsoft ML Server and Visual Studio 2017.In October 2011, Oracle announced the Big Data Appliance, which integrates R, Apache Hadoop, Oracle Linux, and a NoSQL database with Exadata hardware. As of 2012, Oracle R Enterprise became one of two components of the Oracle Advanced Analytics Option .IBM offers support for in Hadoop execution of R, and provides a programming model for massively parallel in database analytics in R.TIBCO offers a runtime version R as a part of Spotfire.Mango Solutions offers a validation package for R, ValidR, to comply with drug approval agencies, such as the FDA. These agencies required the use of validated software, as attested by the vendor or sponsor.  Examples   Basic syntax  The following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command line interface. In R, the generally preferred assignment operator is an arrow made from two characters , although can be used in some cases.  Structure of a function  One of R's strengths is the ease of creating new functions. Objects in the function body remain local to the function, and any data type may be returned. Example:  Modeling and plotting  The R language has built in support for data modeling and graphics. The following example shows how R can easily generate and plot a linear model with residuals.  Mandelbrot set  Short R code calculating Mandelbrot set through the first 20 iterations of equation z z2 c plotted for different complex constants c. This example demonstrates: use of community developed external libraries , in this case caTools package handling of complex numbers multidimensional arrays of numbers used as basic data type, see variables C, Z and X.

            "text": "In object oriented programming, a class is an extensible program code template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior . In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class , the name for the default constructor of the class , and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated. Although, to the point of conflation, one could argue that is a feature inherent in a language because of its polymorphic nature and why these languages are so powerful, dynamic and adaptable for use compared to languages without polymorphism present. Thus they can model dynamic systems more easily. When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an instance of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called instance variables, to contrast with the class variables shared across the class. In certain languages, classes are, as a matter of fact, only a compile time feature , while in other languages classes are first class citizens, and are generally themselves objects . In these languages, a class that creates classes within itself is called a metaclass.  Class vs. type In its most casual usage, people often refer to the class of an object, but narrowly speaking objects have type: the interface, namely the types of member variables, the signatures of member functions , and properties these satisfy. At the same time, a class has an implementation , and can create objects of a given type, with a given implementation. In the terms of type theory, a class is an implementation a concrete data structure and collection of subroutines while a type is an interface. Different classes can produce objects of the same type ; for example, the type Stack might be implemented with two classes SmallStack and ScalableStack . Similarly, a given class may have several different constructors. Class types generally represent nouns, such as a person, place or thing, or something nominalized, and a class represents an implementation of these. For example, a Banana type might represent the properties and functionality of bananas in general, while the ABCBanana and XYZBanana classes would represent ways of producing bananas . The ABCBanana class could then produce particular bananas: instances of the ABCBanana class would be objects of type Banana. Often only a single implementation of a type is given, in which case the class name is often identical with the type name.  Design and implementation Classes are composed from structural and behavioral constituents. Programming languages that include classes as a programming construct offer support, for various class related features, and the syntax required to use these features varies greatly from one programming language to another.  Structure  A class contains data field descriptions . These are usually field types and names that will be associated with state variables at program run time; these state variables either belong to the class or specific instances of the class. In most languages, the structure defined by the class determines the layout of the memory used by its instances. Other implementations are possible: for example, objects in Python use associative key value containers.Some programming languages such as Eiffel support specification of invariants as part of the definition of the class, and enforce them through the type system. Encapsulation of state is necessary for being able to enforce the invariants of the class.  Behavior  The behavior of class or its instances is defined using methods. Methods are subroutines with the ability to operate on objects or classes. These operations may alter the state of an object or simply provide ways of accessing it. Many kinds of methods exist, but support for them varies across languages. Some types of methods are created and called by programmer code, while other special methods such as constructors, destructors, and conversion operators are created and called by compiler generated code. A language may also allow the programmer to define and call these special methods.  The concept of class interface  Every class implements an interface by providing structure and behavior. Structure consists of data and state, and behavior consists of code that specifies how methods are implemented. There is a distinction between the definition of an interface and the implementation of that interface; however, this line is blurred in many programming languages because class declarations both define and implement an interface. Some languages, however, provide features that separate interface and implementation. For example, an abstract class can define an interface without providing implementation. Languages that support class inheritance also allow classes to inherit interfaces from the classes that they are derived from. For example, if class A inherits from class B and if class B implements the interface interface B then class A also inherits the functionality provided by interface B . In languages that support access specifiers, the interface of a class is considered to be the set of public members of the class, including both methods and attributes ; any private members or internal data structures are not intended to be depended on by external code and thus are not part of the interface. Object oriented programming methodology dictates that the operations of any interface of a class are to be independent of each other. It results in a layered design where clients of an interface use the methods declared in the interface. An interface places no requirements for clients to invoke the operations of one interface in any particular order. This approach has the benefit that client code can assume that the operations of an interface are available for use whenever the client has access to the object.  Example  The buttons on the front of your television set are the interface between you and the electrical wiring on the other side of its plastic casing. You press the power button to toggle the television on and off. In this example, your particular television is the instance, each method is represented by a button, and all the buttons together compose the interface . In its most common form, an interface is a specification of a group of related methods without any associated implementation of the methods. A television set also has a myriad of attributes, such as size and whether it supports colour, which together comprise its structure. A class represents the full description of a television, including its attributes and buttons . Getting the total number of televisions manufactured could be a static method of the television class. This method is clearly associated with the class, yet is outside the domain of each individual instance of the class. A static method that finds a particular instance out of the set of all television objects is another example.  Member accessibility  The following is a common set of access specifiers: Private restricts the access to the class itself. Only methods that are part of the same class can access private members. Protected allows the class itself and all its subclasses to access the member. Public means that any code can access the member by its name.Although many object oriented languages support the above access specifiers, their semantics may differ. Object oriented design uses the access specifiers in conjunction with careful design of public method implementations to enforce class invariants constraints on the state of the objects. A common usage of access specifiers is to separate the internal data of a class from its interface: the internal structure is made private, while public accessor methods can be used to inspect or alter such private data. Access specifiers do not necessarily control visibility, in that even private members may be visible to client external code. In some languages, an inaccessible but visible member may be referred to at run time , but an attempt to use it by referring to the name of the member from client code will be prevented by the type checker.The various object oriented programming languages enforce member accessibility and visibility to various degrees, and depending on the language's type system and compilation policies, enforced at either compile time or run time. For example, the Java language does not allow client code that accesses the private data of a class to compile. In the C language, private methods are visible, but not accessible in the interface; however, they may be made invisible by explicitly declaring fully abstract classes that represent the interfaces of the class.Some languages feature other accessibility schemes: Instance vs. class accessibility: Ruby supports instance private and instance protected access specifiers in lieu of class private and class protected, respectively. They differ in that they restrict access based on the instance itself, rather than the instance's class. Friend: C supports a mechanism where a function explicitly declared as a friend function of the class may access the members designated as private or protected. Path based: Java supports restricting access to a member within a Java package, which is the logical path of the file. However, it is a common practice when extending a Java framework to implement classes in the same package as a framework class in order to access protected members. The source file may exist in a completely different location, and may be deployed to a different .jar file, yet still be in the same logical path as far as the JVM is concerned.  Inter class relationships In addition to the design of standalone classes, programming languages may support more advanced class design based upon relationships between classes. The inter class relationship design capabilities commonly provided are compositional and hierarchical.  Compositional  Classes can be composed of other classes, thereby establishing a compositional relationship between the enclosing class and its embedded classes. Compositional relationship between classes is also commonly known as a has a relationship. For example, a class Car could be composed of and contain a class Engine . Therefore, a Car has an Engine. One aspect of composition is containment, which is the enclosure of component instances by the instance that has them. If an enclosing object contains component instances by value, the components and their enclosing object have a similar lifetime. If the components are contained by reference, they may not have a similar lifetime. For example, in Objective C 2.0: This Car class has an instance of NSString , Engine, and NSArray .  Hierarchical  Classes can be derived from one or more existing classes, thereby establishing a hierarchical relationship between the derived from classes and the derived class . The relationship of the derived class to the derived from classes is commonly known as an is a relationship. For example, a class 'Button' could be derived from a class 'Control'. Therefore, a Button is a Control. Structural and behavioral members of the parent classes are inherited by the child class. Derived classes can define additional structural members and behavioral members in addition to those that they inherit and are therefore specializations of their superclasses. Also, derived classes can override inherited methods if the language allows. Not all languages support multiple inheritance. For example, Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, but only inherit from one class. If multiple inheritance is allowed, the hierarchy is a directed acyclic graph , otherwise it is a tree. The hierarchy has classes as nodes and inheritance relationships as links. Classes in the same level are more likely to be associated than classes in different levels. The levels of this hierarchy are called layers or levels of abstraction. Example : In this example, a UITableView is a UIScrollView is a UIView is a UIResponder is an NSObject.  Definitions of subclass  Conceptually, a superclass is a superset of its subclasses. For example, a common class hierarchy would involve GraphicObject as a superclass of Rectangle and Ellipse, while Square would be a subclass of Rectangle. These are all subset relations in set theory as well, i.e., all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares. A common conceptual error is to mistake a part of relation with a subclass. For example, a car and truck are both kinds of vehicles and it would be appropriate to model them as subclasses of a vehicle class. However, it would be an error to model the component parts of the car as subclass relations. For example, a car is composed of an engine and body, but it would not be appropriate to model engine or body as a subclass of car. In object oriented modeling these kinds of relations are typically modeled as object properties. In this example, the Car class would have a property called parts. parts would be typed to hold a collection of objects, such as instances of Body, Engine, Tires, etc. Object modeling languages such as UML include capabilities to model various aspects of part of and other kinds of relations data such as the cardinality of the objects, constraints on input and output values, etc. This information can be utilized by developer tools to generate additional code beside the basic data definitions for the objects, such as error checking on get and set methods.One important question when modeling and implementing a system of object classes is whether a class can have one or more superclasses. In the real world with actual sets it would be rare to find sets that didn't intersect with more than one other set. However, while some systems such as Flavors and CLOS provide a capability for more than one parent to do so at run time introduces complexity that many in the object oriented community consider antithetical to the goals of using object classes in the first place. Understanding which class will be responsible for handling a message can get complex when dealing with more than one superclass. If used carelessly this feature can introduce some of the same system complexity and ambiguity classes were designed to avoid.Most modern object oriented languages such as Smalltalk and Java require single inheritance at run time. For these languages, multiple inheritance may be useful for modeling but not for an implementation. However, semantic web application objects do have multiple superclasses. The volatility of the Internet requires this level of flexibility and the technology standards such as the Web Ontology Language are designed to support it. A similar issue is whether or not the class hierarchy can be modified at run time. Languages such as Flavors, CLOS, and Smalltalk all support this feature as part of their meta object protocols. Since classes are themselves first class objects, it is possible to have them dynamically alter their structure by sending them the appropriate messages. Other languages that focus more on strong typing such as Java and C do not allow the class hierarchy to be modified at run time. Semantic web objects have the capability for run time changes to classes. The rational is similar to the justification for allowing multiple superclasses, that the Internet is so dynamic and flexible that dynamic changes to the hierarchy are required to manage this volatility.  Orthogonality of the class concept and inheritance  Although class based languages are commonly assumed to support inheritance, inheritance is not an intrinsic aspect of the concept of classes. Some languages, often referred to as object based languages , support classes yet do not support inheritance. Examples of object based languages include earlier versions of Visual Basic.  Within object oriented analysis  In object oriented analysis and in UML, an association between two classes represents a collaboration between the classes or their corresponding instances. Associations have direction; for example, a bi directional association between two classes indicates that both of the classes are aware of their relationship. Associations may be labeled according to their name or purpose.An association role is given end of an association and describes the role of the corresponding class. For example, a subscriber role describes the way instances of the class Person participate in a subscribes to association with the class Magazine . Also, a Magazine has the subscribed magazine role in the same association. Association role multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association. Common multiplicities are 0..1 , 1..1 , 1.. and 0.. , where the  specifies any number of instances.  Taxonomy of classes There are many categories of classes, some of which overlap.  Abstract and concrete  In a language that supports inheritance, an abstract class, or abstract base class , is a class that cannot be instantiated because it is either labeled as abstract or it simply specifies abstract methods . An abstract class may provide implementations of some methods, and may also specify virtual methods via signatures that are to be implemented by direct or indirect descendants of the abstract class. Before a class derived from an abstract class can be instantiated, all abstract methods of its parent classes must be implemented by some class in the derivation chain.Most object oriented programming languages allow the programmer to specify which classes are considered abstract and will not allow these to be instantiated. For example, in Java, C and PHP, the keyword abstract is used. In C , an abstract class is a class having at least one abstract method given by the appropriate syntax in that language .A class consisting of only virtual methods is called a Pure Abstract Base Class in C and is also known as an interface by users of the language. Other languages, notably Java and C , support a variant of abstract classes called an interface via a keyword in the language. In these languages, multiple inheritance is not allowed, but a class can implement multiple interfaces. Such a class can only contain abstract publicly accessible methods.A concrete class is a class that can be instantiated, as opposed to abstract classes, which cannot.  Local and inner  In some languages, classes can be declared in scopes other than the global scope. There are various types of such classes. An inner class is a class defined within another class. The relationship between an inner class and its containing class can also be treated as another type of class association. An inner class is typically neither associated with instances of the enclosing class nor instantiated along with its enclosing class. Depending on language, it may or may not be possible to refer to the class from outside the enclosing class. A related concept is inner types, also known as inner data type or nested type, which is a generalization of the concept of inner classes. C is an example of a language that supports both inner classes and inner types .Another type is a local class, which is a class defined within a procedure or function. This limits references to the class name to within the scope where the class is declared. Depending on the semantic rules of the language, there may be additional restrictions on local classes compared to non local ones. One common restriction is to disallow local class methods to access local variables of the enclosing function. For example, in C , a local class may refer to static variables declared within its enclosing function, but may not access the function's automatic variables.  Metaclasses  Metaclasses are classes whose instances are classes. A metaclass describes a common structure of a collection of classes and can implement a design pattern or describe particular kinds of classes. Metaclasses are often used to describe frameworks.In some languages, such as Python, Ruby or Smalltalk, a class is also an object; thus each class is an instance of a unique metaclass that is built into the language. The Common Lisp Object System provides metaobject protocols to implement those classes and metaclasses.  Non subclassable  Non subclassable classes allow programmers to design classes and hierarchies of classes where at some level in the hierarchy, further derivation is prohibited . Contrast this to abstract classes, which imply, encourage, and require derivation in order to be used at all. A non subclassable class is implicitly concrete. A non subclassable class is created by declaring the class as sealed in C or as final in Java or PHP. For example, Java's String class is designated as final.Non subclassable classes may allow a compiler to perform optimizations that are not available for subclassable classes.  Open Class  An open class is one that can be changed. Typically, an executable program cannot be changed by customers. Developers can often change some classes, but typically cannot change standard or built in ones. In Ruby, all classes are open. In Python, classes can be created at runtime, and all can be modified afterwards. Objective C categories permit the programmer to add methods to an existing class without the need to recompile that class or even have access to its source code.  Mixins  Some languages have special support for mixins, though in any language with multiple inheritance a mixin is simply a class that does not represent an is a type of relationship. Mixins are typically used to add the same methods to multiple classes; for example, a class UnicodeConversionMixin might provide a method called unicode to ascii when included in classes FileReader and WebPageScraper that do not share a common parent.  Partial  In languages supporting the feature, a partial class is a class whose definition may be split into multiple pieces, within a single source code file or across multiple files. The pieces are merged at compile time, making compiler output the same as for a non partial class. The primary motivation for introduction of partial classes is to facilitate the implementation of code generators, such as visual designers. It is otherwise a challenge or compromise to develop code generators that can manage the generated code when it is interleaved within developer written code. Using partial classes, a code generator can process a separate file or coarse grained partial class within a file, and is thus alleviated from intricately interjecting generated code via extensive parsing, increasing compiler efficiency and eliminating the potential risk of corrupting developer code. In a simple implementation of partial classes, the compiler can perform a phase of precompilation where it unifies all the parts of a partial class. Then, compilation can proceed as usual. Other benefits and effects of the partial class feature include: Enables separation of a class's interface and implementation code in a unique way. Eases navigation through large classes within an editor. Enables separation of concerns, in a way similar to aspect oriented programming but without using any extra tools. Enables multiple developers to work on a single class concurrently without the need to merge individual code into one file at a later time.Partial classes have existed in Smalltalk under the name of Class Extensions for considerable time. With the arrival of the .NET framework 2, Microsoft introduced partial classes, supported in both C 2.0 and Visual Basic 2005. WinRT also supports partial classes.  Example in VB.NET  This simple example, written in Visual Basic .NET, shows how parts of the same class are defined in two different files. file1.vb file2.vb When compiled, the result is the same as if the two files were written as one, like this:  Example in Objective C  In Objective C, partial classes, also known as categories, may even spread over multiple libraries and executables, like the following example. But a key difference is that Objective C's categories can overwrite definitions in another interface declaration, and that categories aren't equal to original class definition . Instead, .NET partial class can't have conflicting definitions, and all partial definitions are equal to the others.In Foundation, header file NSData.h: In user supplied library, a separate binary from Foundation framework, header file NSData base64.h: And in an app, yet another separate binary file, source code file main.m: The dispatcher will find both methods called over the NSData instance and invoke both of them correctly.  Uninstantiable  Uninstantiable classes allow programmers to group together per class fields and methods that are accessible at runtime without an instance of the class. Indeed, instantiation is prohibited for this kind of class. For example, in C , a class marked static can not be instantiated, can only have static members , may not have instance constructors, and is sealed.  Unnamed  An unnamed class or anonymous class is a class that is not bound to a name or identifier upon definition. This is analogous to named versus unnamed functions.  Benefits The benefits of organizing software into object classes fall into three categories: Rapid development Ease of maintenance Reuse of code and designsObject classes facilitate rapid development because they lessen the semantic gap between the code and the users. System analysts can talk to both developers and users using essentially the same vocabulary, talking about accounts, customers, bills, etc. Object classes often facilitate rapid development because most object oriented environments come with powerful debugging and testing tools. Instances of classes can be inspected at run time to verify that the system is performing as expected. Also, rather than get dumps of core memory, most object oriented environments have interpreted debugging capabilities so that the developer can analyze exactly where in the program the error occurred and can see which methods were called to which arguments and with what arguments.Object classes facilitate ease of maintenance via encapsulation. When developers need to change the behavior of an object they can localize the change to just that object and its component parts. This reduces the potential for unwanted side effects from maintenance enhancements. Software re use is also a major benefit of using Object classes. Classes facilitate re use via inheritance and interfaces. When a new behavior is required it can often be achieved by creating a new class and having that class inherit the default behaviors and data of its superclass and then tailor some aspect of the behavior or data accordingly. Re use via interfaces occurs when another object wants to invoke some object class. This method for re use removes many of the common errors that can make their way into software when one program re uses code from another.  Run time representation As a data type, a class is usually considered as a compile time construct. A language or library may also support prototype or factory metaobjects that represent run time information about classes, or even represent metadata that provides access to reflection facilities and ability to manipulate data structure formats at run time. Many languages distinguish this kind of run time type information about classes from a class on the basis that the information is not needed at run time. Some dynamic languages do not make strict distinctions between run time and compile time constructs, and therefore may not distinguish between metaobjects and classes. For example, if Human is a metaobject representing the class Person, then instances of class Person can be created by using the facilities of the Human metaobject.

            "text": "In computer programming, a function or subroutine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed. Functions may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs. In different programming languages, a function may be called a routine, subprogram, subroutine, method, or procedure. Technically, these terms all have different definitions, and the nomenclature varies from language to language. The generic umbrella term callable unit is sometimes used.A function is often coded so that it can be started several times and from several places during one execution of the program, including from other functions, and then branch back to the next instruction after the call, once the function's task is done. The idea of a function was initially conceived by John Mauchly during his work on ENIAC, and recorded in a January 1947 Harvard symposium on Preparation of Problems for EDVAC type Machines . Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler, and Stanley Gill are generally credited with the formal invention of this concept, which they termed a closed sub routine, contrasted with an open subroutine or macro. However, Alan Turing had discussed functions in a paper of 1945 on design proposals for the NPL ACE, going so far as to invent the concept of a return address stack.Functions are a powerful programming tool, and the syntax of many programming languages includes support for writing and using them. Judicious use of functions will often substantially reduce the cost of developing and maintaining a large program, while increasing its quality and reliability. functions, often collected into libraries, are an important mechanism for sharing and trading software. The discipline of object oriented programming is based on objects and methods . In the compiling method called threaded code, the executable program is basically a sequence of function calls.  Main concepts The content of a function is its body, which is the piece of program code that is executed when the function is called or invoked. A function may be written so that it expects to obtain one or more data values from the calling program . The calling program provides actual values for these parameters, called arguments. Different programming languages may use different conventions for passing arguments: A function call may also have side effects such as modifying data structures in a computer memory, reading from or writing to a peripheral device, creating a file, halting the program or the machine, or even delaying the program's execution for a specified time. A subprogram with side effects may return different results each time it is called, even if it is called with the same arguments. An example is a random number function, available in many languages, that returns a different pseudo random number each time it is called. The widespread use of functions with side effects is a characteristic of imperative programming languages. A function can be coded so that it may call itself recursively, at one or more places, to perform its task. This method allows direct implementation of functions defined by mathematical induction and recursive divide and conquer algorithms. A function whose purpose is to compute one boolean valued function is sometimes called a predicate. In logic programming languages, often all functions are called predicates, since they primarily determine success or failure.A function that returns no value or returns a null value is sometimes called a procedure. Procedures usually modify their arguments and are a core part of procedural programming.  Terminology A subroutine is a function that doesn't return a value. The primary purpose of functions is to break up complicated computations into meaningful chunks and name them. The function may return a computed value to its caller , or provide various result values or output parameters. Indeed, a common use of functions is to implement mathematical functions, in which the purpose of the function is purely to compute one or more results whose values are entirely determined by the arguments passed to the function. In some languages the syntax for a procedure that returns a value is essentially the same as the syntax for a procedure that does not return a value, except for the absence of, e.g., RETURNS clause. In some languages a procedure may dynamically choose to return with or without a value, depending on its arguments.  Language support High level programming languages usually include specific constructs to: Delimit the part of the program that makes up the function Assign an identifier to the function Specify the names and data types of its parameters and return values Provide a private naming scope for its temporary variables Identify variables outside the function that are accessible within it Call the function Provide values to its parameters The main program contains the address of the subprogram The subprogram contains the address of the next instruction of the function call in the main program Specify the return values from within its body Return to the calling program Dispose of the values returned by a call Handle any exceptional conditions encountered during the call Package functions into a module, library, object, or classSome programming languages, such as Pascal, Fortran, Ada and many dialects of BASIC, distinguish between functions or function subprograms, which provide an explicit return value to the calling program, and subroutines or procedures, which do not. In those languages, function calls are normally embedded in expressions . Procedure calls either behave syntactically as statements or are explicitly invoked by a statement such as CALL or GOSUB . Other languages, such as C and Lisp, do not distinguish between functions and subroutines. In strictly functional programming languages such as Haskell, subprograms can have no side effects, which means that various internal states of the program will not change. Functions will always return the same result if repeatedly called with the same arguments. Such languages typically only support functions that return a value, since functions that do not return a value have no use unless they can cause a side effect. In programming languages such as C, C , and C , functions that return a value and functions that return no value are both called functions . A language's compiler will usually translate procedure calls and returns into machine instructions according to a well defined calling convention, so that functions can be compiled separately from the programs that call them. The instruction sequences corresponding to call and return statements are called the procedure's prologue and epilogue.  Advantages The advantages of breaking a program into functions include: Decomposing a complex programming task into simpler steps: this is one of the two main tools of structured programming, along with data structures Reducing duplicate code within a program Enabling reuse of code across multiple programs Dividing a large programming task among various programmers or various stages of a project Hiding implementation details from users of the function Improving readability of code by replacing a block of code with a function call where a descriptive function name serves to describe the block of code. This makes the calling code concise and readable even if the function is not meant to be reused. Improving traceability ; by not decomposing the code into functions, debugging would be severely impaired  Disadvantages Compared to using in line code, invoking a function imposes some computational overhead in the call mechanism.A function typically requires standard housekeeping code both at the entry to, and exit from, the function .  History The idea of a function was worked out after computing machines had already existed for some time. The arithmetic and conditional jump instructions were planned ahead of time and have changed relatively little, but the special instructions used for procedure calls have changed greatly over the years. The earliest computers and microprocessors, such as the Manchester Baby and the RCA 1802, did not have a single function call instruction. Functions could be implemented, but they required programmers to use the call sequence a series of instructions at each call site. Functions were implemented in Konrad Zuse's Z4 in 1945. In 1945, Alan M. Turing used the terms bury and unbury as a means of calling and returning from functions.In January 1947 John Mauchly presented general notes at 'A Symposium of Large Scale Digital Calculating Machinery' under the joint sponsorship of Harvard University and the Bureau of Ordnance, United States Navy. Here he discusses serial and parallel operation suggesting ...the structure of the machine need not be complicated one bit. It is possible, since all the logical characteristics essential to this procedure are available, to evolve a coding instruction for placing the subroutines in the memory at places known to the machine, and in such a way that they may easily be called into use.In In other words, one can designate subroutine A as division and subroutine B as complex multiplication and subroutine C as the evaluation of a standard error of a sequence of numbers, and so on through the list of subroutines needed for a particular problem. ... All these subroutines will then be stored in the machine, and all one needs to do is make a brief reference to them by number, as they are indicated in the coding. Kay McNulty had worked closely with John Mauchly on the ENIAC team and developed an idea for functions for the ENIAC computer she was programming during World War II. She and the other ENIAC programmers used the functions to help calculate missile trajectories.Goldstine and von Neumann wrote a paper dated 16 August 1948 discussing the use of functions.Some very early computers and microprocessors, such as the IBM 1620, the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008, and the PIC microcontrollers, have a single instruction function call that uses a dedicated hardware stack to store return addresses such hardware supports only a few levels of function nesting, but can support recursive functions. Machines before the mid 1960s such as the UNIVAC I, the PDP 1, and the IBM 1130 typically use a calling convention which saved the instruction counter in the first memory location of the called function. This allows arbitrarily deep levels of function nesting but does not support recursive functions. The IBM System 360 had a function call instruction that placed the saved instruction counter value into a general purpose register; this can be used to support arbitrarily deep function nesting and recursive functions. The PDP 11 is one of the first computers with a stack pushing function call instruction; this feature also supports both arbitrarily deep function nesting and recursive functions.  Language support In the very early assemblers, function support was limited. Functions were not explicitly separated from each other or from the main program, and indeed the source code of a function could be interspersed with that of other subprograms. Some assemblers would offer predefined macros to generate the call and return sequences. By the 1960s, assemblers usually had much more sophisticated support for both inline and separately assembled functions that could be linked together. One of the first programming languages to support user written functions and functions was FORTRAN II. The IBM FORTRAN II compiler was released in 1958. ALGOL 58 and other early programming languages also supported procedural programming.  Function libraries Even with this cumbersome approach, functions proved very useful. For one thing, they allowed the use of the same code in many different programs. Moreover, memory was a very scarce resource on early computers, and functions allowed significant savings in the size of programs. Many early computers loaded the program instructions into memory from a punched paper tape. Each function could then be provided by a separate piece of tape, loaded or spliced before or after the main program ; and the same function tape could then be used by many different programs. A similar approach applied in computers that used punched cards for their main input. The name function library originally meant a library, in the literal sense, which kept indexed collections of tapes or card decks for collective use.  Return by indirect jump To remove the need for self modifying code, computer designers eventually provided an indirect jump instruction, whose operand, instead of being the return address itself, was the location of a variable or processor register containing the return address. On those computers, instead of modifying the function's return jump, the calling program would store the return address in a variable so that when the function completed, it would execute an indirect jump that would direct execution to the location given by the predefined variable.  Jump to function Another advance was the jump to function instruction, which combined the saving of the return address with the calling jump, thereby minimizing overhead significantly. In the IBM System 360, for example, the branch instructions BAL or BALR, designed for procedure calling, would save the return address in a processor register specified in the instruction, by convention register 14. To return, the function had only to execute an indirect branch instruction through that register. If the function needed that register for some other purpose , it would save the register's contents to a private memory location or a register stack. In systems such as the HP 2100, the JSB instruction would perform a similar task, except that the return address was stored in the memory location that was the target of the branch. Execution of the procedure would actually begin at the next memory location. In the HP 2100 assembly language, one would write, for example to call a function called MYSUB from the main program. The function would be coded as The JSB instruction placed the address of the NEXT instruction into the location specified as its operand , and then branched to the NEXT location after that . The function could then return to the main program by executing the indirect jump JMP MYSUB, I which branched to the location stored at location MYSUB. Compilers for Fortran and other languages could easily make use of these instructions when available. This approach supported multiple levels of calls; however, since the return address, parameters, and return values of a function were assigned fixed memory locations, it did not allow for recursive calls. Incidentally, a similar method was used by Lotus 1 2 3, in the early 1980s, to discover the recalculation dependencies in a spreadsheet. Namely, a location was reserved in each cell to store the return address. Since circular references are not allowed for natural recalculation order, this allows a tree walk without reserving space for a stack in memory, which was very limited on small computers such as the IBM PC.  Call stack Most modern implementations of a function call use a call stack, a special case of the stack data structure, to implement function calls and returns. Each procedure call creates a new entry, called a stack frame, at the top of the stack; when the procedure returns, its stack frame is deleted from the stack, and its space may be used for other procedure calls. Each stack frame contains the private data of the corresponding call, which typically includes the procedure's parameters and internal variables, and the return address. The call sequence can be implemented by a sequence of ordinary instructions and very long instruction word architectures , but many traditional machines designed since the late 1960s have included special instructions for that purpose. The call stack is usually implemented as a contiguous area of memory. It is an arbitrary design choice whether the bottom of the stack is the lowest or highest address within this area, so that the stack may grow forwards or backwards in memory; however, many architectures chose the latter.Some designs, notably some Forth implementations, used two separate stacks, one mainly for control information and the other for data. The former was, or worked like, a call stack and was only indirectly accessible to the programmer through other language constructs while the latter was more directly accessible. When stack based procedure calls were first introduced, an important motivation was to save precious memory. With this scheme, the compiler does not have to reserve separate space in memory for the private data of each procedure. At any moment, the stack contains only the private data of the calls that are currently active . Because of the ways in which programs were usually assembled from libraries, it was not uncommon to find programs that include thousands of functions, of which only a handful are active at any given moment. For such programs, the call stack mechanism could save significant amounts of memory. Indeed, the call stack mechanism can be viewed as the earliest and simplest method for automatic memory management. However, another advantage of the call stack method is that it allows recursive function calls, since each nested call to the same procedure gets a separate instance of its private data.  Delayed stacking  One disadvantage of the call stack mechanism is the increased cost of a procedure call and its matching return. The extra cost includes incrementing and decrementing the stack pointer , and accessing the local variables and parameters by frame relative addresses, instead of absolute addresses. The cost may be realized in increased execution time, or increased processor complexity, or both. This overhead is most obvious and objectionable in leaf procedures or leaf functions, which return without making any procedure calls themselves. To reduce that overhead, many modern compilers try to delay the use of a call stack until it is really needed. For example, the call of a procedure P may store the return address and parameters of the called procedure in certain processor registers, and transfer control to the procedure's body by a simple jump. If the procedure P returns without making any other call, the call stack is not used at all. If P needs to call another procedure Q, it will then use the call stack to save the contents of any registers that will be needed after Q returns.  Examples   C and C  In the C and C programming languages, subprograms are termed functions . These languages use the special keyword void to indicate that a function does not return any value. Note that C C functions can have side effects, including modifying any variables whose addresses are passed as parameters. Examples: The function does not return a value and has to be called as a stand alone function, e.g., Function1 ; This function returns a result , and the call can be part of an expression, e.g., x Function2 This function converts a number between 0 and 6 into the initial letter of the corresponding day of the week, namely 0 to 'S', 1 to 'M', ..., 6 to 'S'. The result of calling it might be assigned to a variable, e.g., num day Function3 ;. This function does not return a value but modifies the variable whose address is passed as the parameter; it would be called with Function4 ;.  BASIC dialects   Microsoft Small Basic  In the example above, Example calls the function. To define the actual function, the Sub keyword must be used, with the function name following Sub. After content has followed, EndSub must be typed.  Visual Basic  In the Visual Basic language, subprograms are termed functions or subs . Visual Basic 6 uses various terms called types to define what is being passed as a parameter. By default, an unspecified variable is registered as a variant type and can be passed as ByRef or ByVal. Also, when a function or sub is declared, it is given a public, private, or friend designation, which determines whether it can be accessed outside the module or project that it was declared in. By value ByVal a way of passing the value of an argument to a procedure by passing a copy of the value, instead of passing the address. As a result, the variable's actual value can't be changed by the procedure to which it is passed. By reference ByRef a way of passing the value of an argument to a procedure by passing an address of the variable, instead of passing a copy of its value. This allows the procedure to access the actual variable. As a result, the variable's actual value can be changed by the procedure to which it is passed. Unless otherwise specified, arguments are passed by reference. Public  indicates that the function procedure is accessible to all other procedures in all modules. If used in a module that contains an Option Private, the procedure is not available outside the project. Private  indicates that the function procedure is accessible only to other procedures in the module where it is declared. Friend  used only in a class module. Indicates that the Function procedure is visible throughout the project, but not visible to a controller of an instance of an object. The function does not return a value and has to be called as a stand alone function, e.g., Function1 This function returns a result , and the call can be part of an expression, e.g., x Function2 This function converts a number between 0 and 6 into the initial letter of the corresponding day of the week, namely 0 to 'M', 1 to 'T', ..., 6 to 'S'. The result of calling it might be assigned to a variable, e.g., num day Function3 . This function does not return a value but modifies the variable whose address is passed as the parameter; it would be called with Function4 .  PL I  In PL I a called procedure may be passed a descriptor providing information about the argument, such as string lengths and array bounds. This allows the procedure to be more general and eliminates the need for the programmer to pass such information. By default PL I passes arguments by reference. A function to change the sign of each element of a two dimensional array might look like: change sign: procedure ; declare array float; array array; end change sign; This could be called with various arrays as follows:  first array bounds from 5 to 10 and 3 to 9 declare array1 float; second array bounds from 1 to 16 and 1 to 16 declare array2 float; call change sign ; call change sign ;  Python  In Python, the keyword def is used to define a function. The statements that form the body of the function must either continue on the same line or start on the next line and be indented. The following example program prints Hello world! followed by Wikipedia on the next line.  Local variables, recursion and reentrancy A subprogram may find it useful to make use of a certain amount of scratch space; that is, memory used during the execution of that subprogram to hold intermediate results. Variables stored in this scratch space are termed local variables, and the scratch space is termed an activation record. An activation record typically has a return address that tells it where to pass control back to when the subprogram finishes. A subprogram may have any number and nature of call sites. If recursion is supported, a subprogram may even call itself, causing its execution to suspend while another nested execution of the same subprogram occurs. Recursion is a useful means to simplify some complex algorithms and break down complex problems. Recursive languages generally provide a new copy of local variables on each call. If the programmer desires the value of local variables to stay the same between calls, they can be declared static in some languages, or global values or common areas can be used. Here is an example of a recursive function in C C to find Fibonacci numbers: Early languages like Fortran did not initially support recursion because variables were statically allocated, as well as the location for the return address. Most computers before the late 1960s such as the PDP 8 did not have support for hardware stack registers.Modern languages after ALGOL such as PL I and C almost invariably use a stack, usually supported by most modern computer instruction sets to provide a fresh activation record for every execution of a subprogram. That way, the nested execution is free to modify its local variables without concern for the effect on other suspended executions in progress. As nested calls accumulate, a call stack structure is formed, consisting of one activation record for each suspended subprogram. In fact, this stack structure is virtually ubiquitous, and so activation records are commonly termed stack frames. Some languages such as Pascal, PL I, and Ada also support nested functions, which are functions callable only within the scope of an outer function. Inner functions have access to the local variables of the outer function that called them. This is accomplished by storing extra context information within the activation record, also termed a display. If a subprogram can be executed properly even when another execution of the same subprogram is already in progress, that subprogram is said to be reentrant. A recursive subprogram must be reentrant. Reentrant subprograms are also useful in multi threaded situations since multiple threads can call the same subprogram without fear of interfering with each other. In the IBM CICS transaction processing system, quasi reentrant was a slightly less restrictive, but similar, requirement for application programs that were shared by many threads. In a multi threaded environment, there is generally more than one stack. An environment that fully supports coroutines or lazy evaluation may use data structures other than stacks to store their activation records.  Overloading In strongly typed languages, it is sometimes desirable to have a number of functions with the same name, but operating on different types of data, or with different parameter profiles. For example, a square root function might be defined to operate on reals, complex values or matrices. The algorithm to be used in each case is different, and the return result may be different. By writing three separate functions with the same name, the programmer has the convenience of not having to remember different names for each type of data. Further, if a subtype can be defined for the reals, to separate positive and negative reals, two functions can be written for the reals, one to return a real when the parameter is positive, and another to return a complex value when the parameter is negative. In object oriented programming, when a series of functions with the same name can accept different parameter profiles or parameters of different types, each of the functions is said to be overloaded. Here is an example of function overloading in C : In this code, there are two functions of the same name but they have different parameters. As another example, a function might construct an object that will accept directions, and trace its path to these points on screen. There are a plethora of parameters that could be passed in to the constructor . If the programmer wanted the constructor to be able to accept only the color parameter, then he could call another constructor that accepts only color, which in turn calls the constructor with all the parameters passing in a set of default values for all the other parameters . PL I has the GENERIC attribute to define a generic name for a set of entry references called with different types of arguments. Example: DECLARE gen name GENERIC ,      flame WHEN ,      pathname OTHERWISE       ; Multiple argument definitions may be specified for each entry. A call to gen name will result in a call to name when the argument is FIXED BINARY, flame when FLOAT , etc. If the argument matches none of the choices pathname will be called.  Closures  A closure is a subprogram together with the values of some of its variables captured from the environment in which it was created. Closures were a notable feature of the Lisp programming language, introduced by John McCarthy. Depending on the implementation, closures can serve as a mechanism for side effects.  Conventions A wide number of conventions for the coding of functions have been developed. Pertaining to their naming, many developers have adopted the approach that the name of a function should be a verb when it does a certain task, and adjective when it makes some inquiry, and a noun when it is used to substitute variables. Some programmers suggest that a function should perform only one task, and if a function does perform more than one task, it should be split up into more functions. They argue that functions are key components in code maintenance, and their roles in the program must remain distinct. Proponents of modular programming advocate that each function should have minimal dependency on other pieces of code. For example, the use of global variables is generally deemed unwise by advocates for this perspective, because it adds tight coupling between the function and these global variables. If such coupling is not necessary, their advice is to refactor functions to accept passed parameters instead. However, increasing the number of parameters passed to functions can affect code readability.  Return codes Besides its main or normal effect, a function may need to inform the calling program about exceptional conditions that may have occurred during its execution. In some languages and programming standards, this is often done through a return code, an integer value placed by the function in some standard location, which encodes the normal and exceptional conditions. In the IBM System 360, where return code was expected from the function, the return value was often designed to be a multiple of 4 so that it could be used as a direct branch table index into a branch table often located immediately after the call instruction to avoid extra conditional tests, further improving efficiency. In the System 360 assembly language, one would write, for example:  Optimization of function calls There is a significant runtime overhead in calling a function, including passing the arguments, branching to the subprogram, and branching back to the caller. The overhead often includes saving and restoring certain processor registers, allocating and reclaiming call frame storage, etc.. In some languages, each function call also implies automatic testing of the function's return code or the handling of exceptions that it may raise. A significant source of overhead in object oriented languages is the intensively used dynamic dispatch for method calls. There are some seemingly obvious optimizations of procedure calls that cannot be applied if the procedures may have side effects. For example, in the expression 1 1 , the function f must be called twice, because the two calls may return different results. Moreover, the value of x must be fetched again before the second call, since the first call may have changed it. Determining whether a subprogram may have a side effect is very difficult . So, while those optimizations are safe in purely functional programming languages, compilers of typical imperative programming usually have to assume the worst.  Inlining  A method used to eliminate this overhead is inline expansion or inlining of the subprogram's body at each call site . Not only does this avoid the call overhead, but it also allows the compiler to optimize the procedure's body more effectively by taking into account the context and arguments at that call. The inserted body can be optimized by the compiler. Inlining, however, will usually increase the code size, unless the program contains only one call to the function.

            "text": "A method in object oriented programming is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of state data and behavior; these compose an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of its various consumers. A method is a behavior of an object parametrized by a consumer. Data is represented as properties of the object, and behaviors are represented as methods. For example, a Window object could have methods such as open and close, while its state would be a property. In class based programming, methods are defined within a class, and objects are instances of a given class. One of the most important capabilities that a method provides is method overriding the same name can be used for multiple different kinds of classes. This allows the sending objects to invoke behaviors and to delegate the implementation of those behaviors to the receiving object. A method in Java programming sets the behavior of a class object. For example, an object can send an area message to another object and the appropriate formula is invoked whether the receiving object is a rectangle, circle, triangle, etc. Methods also provide the interface that other classes use to access and modify the properties of an object; this is known as encapsulation. Encapsulation and overriding are the two primary distinguishing features between methods and procedure calls.  Overriding and overloading Method overriding and overloading are two of the most significant ways that a method differs from a conventional procedure or function call. Overriding refers to a subclass redefining the implementation of a method of its superclass. For example, findArea may be a method defined on a shape class, triangle, etc. would each define the appropriate formula to calculate their area. The idea is to look at objects as black boxes so that changes to the internals of the object can be made with minimal impact on the other objects that use it. This is known as encapsulation and is meant to make code easier to maintain and re use. Method overloading, on the other hand, refers to differentiating the code used to handle a message based on the parameters of the method. If one views the receiving object as the first parameter in any method then overriding is just a special case of overloading where the selection is based only on the first argument. The following simple Java example illustrates the difference:  Accessor, mutator and manager methods Accessor methods are used to read the data values of an object. Mutator methods are used to modify the data of an object. Manager methods are used to initialize and destroy objects of a class, e.g. constructors and destructors. These methods provide an abstraction layer that facilitates encapsulation and modularity. For example, if a bank account class provides a getBalance accessor method to retrieve the current balance , then later revisions of the same code can implement a more complex mechanism for balance retrieval , without the dependent code needing to be changed. The concepts of encapsulation and modularity are not unique to object oriented programming. Indeed, in many ways the object oriented approach is simply the logical extension of previous paradigms such as abstract data types and structured programming.  Constructors  A constructor is a method that is called at the beginning of an object's lifetime to create and initialize the object, a process called construction . Initialization may include an acquisition of resources. Constructors may have parameters but usually do not return values in most languages. See the following example in Java:  Destructors  A destructor is a method that is called automatically at the end of an object's lifetime, a process called destruction. Destruction in most languages does not allow destructor method arguments nor return values. Destruction can be implemented so as to perform cleanup chores and other tasks at object destruction.  Finalizers  In garbage collected languages, such as Java, C , and Python, destructors are known as finalizers. They have a similar purpose and function to destructors, but because of the differences between languages that utilize garbage collection and languages with manual memory management, the sequence in which they are called is different.  Abstract methods An abstract method is one with only a signature and no implementation body. It is often used to specify that a subclass must provide an implementation of the method. Abstract methods are used to specify interfaces in some programming languages.  Example  The following Java code shows an abstract class that needs to be extended: The following subclass extends the main class:  Reabstraction  If a subclass provides an implementation for an abstract method, another subclass can make it abstract again. This is called reabstraction. In practice, this is rarely used.  Example  In C , a virtual method can be overridden with an abstract method. Interfaces' default methods can also be reabstracted, requiring subclasses to implement them.  Class methods Class methods are methods that are called on a class rather than an instance. They are typically used as part of an object meta model. I.e, for each class, defined an instance of the class object in the meta model is created. Meta model protocols allow classes to be created and deleted. In this sense, they provide the same functionality as constructors and destructors described above. But in some languages such as the Common Lisp Object System the meta model allows the developer to dynamically alter the object model at run time: e.g., to create new classes, redefine the class hierarchy, modify properties, etc.  Special methods Special methods are very language specific and a language may support none, some, or all of the special methods defined here. A language's compiler may automatically generate default special methods or a programmer may be allowed to optionally define special methods. Most special methods cannot be directly called, but rather the compiler generates code to call them at appropriate times.  Static methods  Static methods are meant to be relevant to all the instances of a class rather than to any specific instance. They are similar to static variables in that sense. An example would be a static method to sum the values of all the variables of every instance of a class. For example, if there were a Product class it might have a static method to compute the average price of all products. In Java, a commonly used static method is: Math.max This static method has no owning object and does not run on an instance. It receives all information from its arguments.A static method can be invoked even if no instances of the class exist yet. Static methods are called static because they are resolved at compile time based on the class they are called on and not dynamically as in the case with instance methods, which are resolved polymorphically based on the runtime type of the object.  Copy assignment operators  Copy assignment operators define actions to be performed by the compiler when a class object is assigned to a class object of the same type.  Operator methods  Operator methods define or redefine operator symbols and define the operations to be performed with the symbol and the associated method parameters. C example:  Member functions in C  Some procedural languages were extended with object oriented capabilities to leverage the large skill sets and legacy code for those languages but still provide the benefits of object oriented development. Perhaps the most well known example is C , an object oriented extension of the C programming language. Due to the design requirements to add the object oriented paradigm on to an existing procedural language, message passing in C has some unique capabilities and terminologies. For example, in C a method is known as a member function. C also has the concept of virtual functions which are member functions that can be overridden in derived classes and allow for dynamic dispatch.  Virtual functions  Virtual functions are the means by which a C class can achieve polymorphic behavior. Non virtual member functions, or regular methods, are those that do not participate in polymorphism.

            "text": "In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. As regions of memory, they contain value and are referenced by identifiers. In the object oriented programming paradigm, object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class based variations of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class. In the relational model of database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity .  Object based languages  An important distinction in programming languages is the difference between an object oriented language and an object based language. A language is usually considered object based if it includes the basic capabilities for an object: identity, properties, and attributes. A language is considered object oriented if it is object based and also has the capability of polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and, possibly, composition. Polymorphism refers to the ability to overload the name of a function with multiple behaviors based on which object are passed to it. Conventional message passing discriminates only on the first object and considers that to be sending a message to that object. However, some object oriented programming languages such as Flavors and the Common Lisp Object System enable discriminating on more than the first parameter of the function. Inheritance is the ability to subclass an object class, to create a new class that is a subclass of an existing one and inherits all the data constraints and behaviors of its parents but also adds new and or changes one or more of them.  Object oriented programming  Object oriented programming is an approach to designing modular reusable software systems. The object oriented approach is an evolution of good design practices that go back to the very beginning of computer programming. Object orientation is simply the logical extension of older techniques such as structured programming and abstract data types. An object is an abstract data type with the addition of polymorphism and inheritance. Rather than structure programs as code and data, an object oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an object . An object has state and behavior . Objects can correspond to things found in the real world. So for example, a graphics program will have objects such as circle, square, menu. An online shopping system will have objects such as shopping cart, customer, product. The shopping system will support behaviors such as place order, make payment, and offer discount. The objects are designed as class hierarchies. So for example with the shopping system there might be high level classes such as electronics product, kitchen product, and book. There may be further refinements for example under electronic products: CD Player, DVD player, etc. These classes and subclasses correspond to sets and subsets in mathematical logic.  Specialized objects An important concept for objects is the design pattern. A design pattern provides a reusable template to address a common problem. The following object descriptions are examples of some of the most common design patterns for objects. Function object: an object with a single method  that acts much like a function . Immutable object: an object set up with a fixed state at creation time and which does not change afterward. First class object: an object that can be used without restriction. Container object: an object that can contain other objects. Factory object: an object whose purpose is to create other objects. Metaobject: an object from which other objects can be created . Prototype object: a specialized metaobject from which other objects can be created by copying God object: an object that knows or does too much . Singleton object: an object that is the only instance of its class during the lifetime of the program. Filter object: an object that receives a stream of data as its input and transforms it into the object's output. Often the input and output streams are streams of characters, but these also may be streams of arbitrary objects. These are generally used in wrappers since they conceal the existing implementation with the abstraction required at the developer side.  Distributed objects  The object oriented approach is not just a programming model. It can be used equally well as an interface definition language for distributed systems. The objects in a distributed computing model tend to be larger grained, longer lasting, and more service oriented than programming objects. A standard method to package distributed objects is via an Interface Definition Language . An IDL shields the client of all of the details of the distributed server object. Details such as which computer the object resides on, what programming language it uses, what operating system, and other platform specific issues. The IDL is also usually part of a distributed environment that provides services such as transactions and persistence to all objects in a uniform manner. Two of the most popular standards for distributed objects are the Object Management Group's CORBA standard and Microsoft's DCOM.In addition to distributed objects, a number of other extensions to the basic concept of an object have been proposed to enable distributed computing: Protocol objects are components of a protocol stack that enclose network communication within an object oriented interface. Replicated objects are groups of distributed objects that run a distributed multi party protocol to achieve high consistency between their internal states, and that respond to requests in a coordinated way. Examples include fault tolerant CORBA objects. Live distributed objects generalize the replicated object concept to groups of replicas that might internally use any distributed protocol, perhaps resulting in only a weak consistency between their local states.Some of these extensions, such as distributed objects and protocol objects, are domain specific terms for special types of ordinary objects used in a certain context . Others, such as replicated objects and live distributed objects, are more non standard, in that they abandon the usual case that an object resides in a single location at a time, and apply the concept to groups of entities that might span across multiple locations, might have only weakly consistent state, and whose membership might dynamically change.  The Semantic Web The Semantic Web is essentially a distributed objects framework. Two key technologies in the Semantic Web are the Web Ontology Language and the Resource Description Framework . RDF provides the capability to define basic objects names, properties, attributes, relations that are accessible via the Internet. OWL adds a richer object model, based on set theory, that provides additional modeling capabilities such as multiple inheritance. OWL objects are not like standard large grained distributed objects accessed via an Interface Definition Language. Such an approach would not be appropriate for the Internet because the Internet is constantly evolving and standardization on one set of interfaces is difficult to achieve. OWL objects tend to be similar to the kinds of objects used to define application domain models in programming languages such as Java and C . However, there are important distinctions between OWL objects and traditional object oriented programming objects. Traditional objects get compiled into static hierarchies usually with single inheritance, but OWL objects are dynamic. An OWL object can change its structure at run time and can become an instance of new or different classes. Another critical difference is the way the model treats information that is currently not in the system. Programming objects and most database systems use the closed world assumption . If a fact is not known to the system that fact is assumed to be false. Semantic Web objects use the open world assumption, a statement is only considered false if there is actual relevant information that it is false, otherwise it is assumed to be unknown, neither true nor false. OWL objects are actually most like objects in artificial intelligence frame languages such as KL ONE and Loom.

            "text": "Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers ; the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu , Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto. Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.5 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents. Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period , though the first written mention of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle finished in the 2nd century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian ky . Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators and feudal lords and enforced by a class of warrior nobility . After a century long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. Amidst a rise in militarism and overseas colonization, Japan invaded China in 1937 and entered World War II as an Axis power in 1941. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution and began a military alliance with the United States. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a highly developed country, and a great power in global politics. Its economy is the world's third largest by nominal GDP and the fourth largest by PPP. Although Japan has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self Defense Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. After World War II, Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming the second largest economy in the world by 1972 but has stagnated since 1995 in what is referred to as the Lost Decades. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, though it is experiencing a decline in population. A global leader in the automotive, robotics and electronics industries, the country has made significant contributions to science and technology. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent comic, animation and video game industries. It is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations , OECD, G20 and Group of Seven.  Etymology  The name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji and is pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa and in Japan by the endonym Yamato. Nippon, the original Sino Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters mean sun origin , which is the source of the popular Western epithet Land of the Rising Sun .The name Japan is based on Chinese pronunciations of and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters  as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.  History   Prehistoric to classical history  A Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan. This was followed from around 14,500 BC by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi sedentary hunter gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. From around 700 BC, the Japonic speaking Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, intermingling with the J mon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh toku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period .The far reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince ama and his nephew Prince tomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsury state, a system of Chinese style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.The Nara period marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij ky . The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki , as well as the development of Buddhist inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735 737 is believed to have killed as much as one third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian ky in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period , during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem Kimigayo were written during this time.  Feudal era  Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H j clan came to power as regents for the sh gun. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go Daigo. Go Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period . The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century long Sengoku period .During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy ; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi Momoyama period. After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh gun by Emperor Go Y zei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo . The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy , and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period . Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki. The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku , the study of Japan by the Japanese.  Modern era  In 1854, Commodore Matthew C. Perry and the Black Ships of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the sh gun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor . Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution , and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji period , the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino Japanese War and the Russo Japanese War , Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.The early 20th century saw a period of Taish democracy overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers. The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino Japanese War . In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7 8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives. The Allies repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second largest economy in the world; this ended in the mid 1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the Lost Decade . On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.  Geography  Japan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000 km northeast southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 . Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world at 29,751 km . Because of its far flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000 km2 .The Japanese archipelago is 67 forests and 14 agricultural. The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation. Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country. Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons km2 as of 2010, while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons km2 as of 2016. As of 2014, approximately 0.5 of Japan's total area is reclaimed land . Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T hoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.  Climate  The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.In the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year round.The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere. The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 C , was recorded on July 23, 2018, and repeated on August 17, 2020.  Biodiversity  Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry ky and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.  Environment  In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Environmental issues include urban air pollution , waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co operation for conservation.  Government and politics  Japan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019. Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. Fumio Kishida is Japan's prime minister; he took office after winning the 2021 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election. The right wing big tent Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B rgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.  Administrative divisions  Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:  Foreign relations  A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and ASEAN Plus Three , and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US 9.2 billion in 2014. In 2019, Japan had the fourth largest diplomatic network in the world.Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan. Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , a multilateral security collaboration reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia and India, reflecting existing relations and patterns of cooperation.Japan's relationship with South Korea had historically been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women. As of 2019 Japan is a major importer of Korean music , television , and other cultural products.Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.  Military  Japan is the second highest ranked Asian country in the 2022 Global Peace Index, after Singapore. It spent 1 of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2020, and maintains the ninth largest military budget in the world. The country's military is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.  Domestic law enforcement  Domestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national level counter terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial level Anti Firearms Squads and Counter NBC Terrorism Squads. The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018, the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence and robbery are very low in Japan.  Economy  Japan has the world's third largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States and China; and the fourth largest economy by PPP. As of 2020, Japan's labor force is the world's eighth largest, and consists of 66.5 million workers. As of 2021, Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.8 . Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 nations, and exceeds 15.7 of the population. Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, with national debt estimated at 248 relative to GDP as of 2022. The Japanese yen is the world's third largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.Japan was the world's fourth largest exporter and importer in 2021. Its exports amounted to 15.6 of its total GDP in 2020. As of 2019, Japan's main export markets were the United States and China . Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2019 were China , the United States , and Australia . Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment. Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018. It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019. It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019, and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism. The 2021 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries. Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to 46.1 billion.  Agriculture and fishery  The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2 of the total country's GDP as of 2018. Only 11.5 of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self sufficiency rate of about 50 as of 2018. Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected. There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.Japan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch, prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.  Industry and services  Japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods . Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5 of its GDP. The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019.Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world as of 2017 and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company. The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces competition from South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.Japan's service sector accounts for about 70 of its total economic output as of 2019. Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, NTT, ON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.  Science and technology  Japan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks twelfth among the most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index and 13th in the Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 15th in 2019. Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world, with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19 trillion yen research and development budget as of 2017. The country has produced twenty two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, and three Fields medalists.Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 55 of the world's 2017 total. Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea and China. However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed 9.6 billion, with 5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming. By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base and landing astronauts by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.  Infrastructure   Transportation  Japan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure. The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers of general national highways and 7641 kilometers of national expressways as of 2017.Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high speed Shinkansen that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.There are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013. The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second busiest airport in 2019. The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017.  Energy  As of 2019, 37.1 of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25.1 from coal, 22.4 from natural gas, 3.5 from hydropower and 2.8 from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy. The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.  Water supply and sanitation  Responsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities. Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98 of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.  Demographics  Japan has a population of 125.4 million, of which 122.8 million are Japanese nationals . A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder. In 2019, 92 of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.9 million . It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people . Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, the Japanese people form 98.1 of the country's population. Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups. Burakumin make up a social minority group.Japan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one third of its total population; this is the result of a post World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates. Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest; it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world. As of 2020, over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or one in four out of the Japanese population. As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless, Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits. The government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.  Religion  Japan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom. Upper estimates suggest that 84 96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non religious or spiritual. The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1 to 1.5 of the population are Christians. Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.About 90 of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign born migrants as of 2016. As of 2018 there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals. Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.  Languages  The Japanese language is Japan's de facto national language and the primary language of most people in the country. Japanese writing uses kanji and two sets of kana , as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language. As a result, the prevalence of English in the educational system has increased, with English classes becoming mandatory at all levels of the Japanese school system by 2020. Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages , part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014. Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign language students, such as Korean , Chinese and Portuguese.  Education  Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years. Almost all children continue their education at a three year senior high school. The two top ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15 year olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest educated labor forces among OECD countries. It spent roughly 3.1 of its total GDP on education as of 2018, below the OECD average of 4.9 . In 2020, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64 year olds that have attained tertiary education with 52.7 . Approximately 61.5 of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 31.3 of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. Japanese females are more highly educated compared to their male counterparts, as 59 of Japanese women possess a university degree, compared to 52 of Japanese men.  Health  Health care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government sponsored insurance.Japan spent 10.74 of its total GDP on healthcare in 2019. In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 84.62 years , the highest in the world; while it had a very low infant mortality rate . Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27 of the total deaths in 2018 followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15 of the deaths. Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue. Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men. However, Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.  Culture  Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.  Art and architecture  The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post Impressionism.Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design. It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.  Literature and philosophy  The earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y sh poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh nagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.During the Edo period, the ch nin overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh with his haikai and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S seki and Mori gai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir Tanizaki, Kaf Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize winning authors Yasunari Kawabata and Kenzabur e .Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.  Performing arts  Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi daiko was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky gen, kabuki, and bunraku. Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.  Holidays  Officially, Japan has 16 national, government recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh wa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.  Cuisine  Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern day tastes includes green tea ice cream.Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14 17 alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.  Media  According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily. Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally; other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs. Many Japanese media franchises such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, and Naruto have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest grossing media franchises. Pok mon in particular is estimated to be the highest grossing media franchise of all time. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016.Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally. Ishir Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest running film franchise in history. Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid 20th century and have become popular worldwide. A large number of manga series have become some of the best selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular internationally.  Sports  Traditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum. Baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has gained a wide following. The country co hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.In motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship. Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open wheel series. The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.Japan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship and will co host the 2023 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.

            "text": "C  is a high level general purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or C with Classes . The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C now has object oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.C was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers , and performance critical applications .C is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization , with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO IEC 14882:2020 . The C programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C 03, C 11, C 14, and C 17 standards. The current C 20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high level features for program organization. Since 2012, C has been on a three year release schedule with C 23 as the next planned standard.  History  In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on C with Classes , the predecessor to C . The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula like features. C was chosen because it was general purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML. Initially, Stroustrup's C with Classes added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments. In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named C  after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type safe free store memory allocation , improved type checking, and BCPL style single line comments with two forward slashes . Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C , Cfront. In 1984, Stroustrup implemented the first stream input output library. The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy . In 1985, the first edition of The C Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard. The first commercial implementation of C was released in October of the same year.In 1989, C 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type. In 1998, C 98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update was released in 2003. After C 98, C evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C 11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C programmers. After a minor C 14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C 17. After becoming finalized in February 2020, a draft of the C 20 standard was approved on 4 September 2020 and officially published on 15 December 2020.On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, for conceptualizing and developing the C programming language . As of 2022 C ranked fourth on the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages, after Python, C and Java.  Etymology  According to Stroustrup, the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C . This name is credited to Rick Mascitti and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue in cheek spirit. The name comes from C's operator and a common naming convention of using  to indicate an enhanced computer program. During C 's development period, the language had been referred to as new C and C with Classes before acquiring its final name.  Philosophy  Throughout C 's life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles: It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs. Every feature should be implementable . Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C . Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C . It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts. No implicit violations of the type system . User created types need to have the same support and performance as built in types. Unused features should not negatively impact created executables . There should be no language beneath C . C should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment. If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.  Standardization  C is standardized by an ISO working group known as JTC1 SC22 WG21. So far, it has published six revisions of the C standard and is currently working on the next revision, C 23. In 1998, the ISO working group standardized C for the first time as ISO IEC 14882:1998, which is informally known as C 98. In 2003, it published a new version of the C standard called ISO IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems identified in C 98. The next major revision of the standard was informally referred to as C 0x , but it was not released until 2011. C 11 included many additions to both the core language and the standard library.In 2014, C 14 was released as a small extension to C 11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements. The Draft International Standard ballot procedures completed in mid August 2014.After C 14, a major revision C 17, informally known as C 1z, was completed by the ISO C committee in mid July 2017 and was approved and published in December 2017.As part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications: ISO IEC TR 18015:2006 on the use of C in embedded systems and on performance implications of C language and library features, ISO IEC TR 19768:2007 on library extensions mostly integrated into C 11, ISO IEC TR 29124:2010 on special mathematical functions, integrated into C 17 ISO IEC TR 24733:2011 on decimal floating point arithmetic, ISO IEC TS 18822:2015 on the standard filesystem library, integrated into C 17 ISO IEC TS 19570:2015 on parallel versions of the standard library algorithms, integrated into C 17 ISO IEC TS 19841:2015 on software transactional memory, ISO IEC TS 19568:2015 on a new set of library extensions, some of which are already integrated into C 17, ISO IEC TS 19217:2015 on the C concepts, integrated into C 20 ISO IEC TS 19571:2016 on the library extensions for concurrency, some of which are already integrated into C 20 ISO IEC TS 19568:2017 on a new set of general purpose library extensions ISO IEC TS 21425:2017 on the library extensions for ranges, integrated into C 20 ISO IEC TS 22277:2017 on coroutines, integrated into C 20 ISO IEC TS 19216:2018 on the networking library ISO IEC TS 21544:2018 on modules, integrated into C 20 ISO IEC TS 19570:2018 on a new set of library extensions for parallelism ISO IEC TS 23619:2021 on a new extensions for reflectionMore technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including new set of concurrency extensions.  Language The C language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C as a light weight abstraction programming language designed for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions ; and offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C . Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages. C inherits most of C's syntax. The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:  Object storage  As in C, C supports four types of memory management: static storage duration objects, thread storage duration objects, automatic storage duration objects, and dynamic storage duration objects.  Static storage duration objects  Static storage duration objects are created before main is entered and destroyed in reverse order of creation after main exits. The exact order of creation is not specified by the standard to allow implementations some freedom in how to organize their implementation. More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that shall last for the duration of the program .Static storage duration objects are initialized in two phases. First, static initialization is performed, and only after all static initialization is performed, dynamic initialization is performed. In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression . Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable. Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call . The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit . No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.  Thread storage duration objects  Variables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.  Automatic storage duration objects  The most common variable types in C are local variables inside a function or block, and temporary variables. The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration and destroyed in the reverse order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the stack. Local variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C . Member variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an automatic object then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members. Temporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated .  Dynamic storage duration objects  These objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to new and destroyed explicitly with a call to delete. C also supports malloc and free, from C, but these are not compatible with new and delete. Use of new returns an address to the allocated memory. The C Core Guidelines advise against using new directly for creating dynamic objects in favor of smart pointers through make unique T for single ownership and make shared T for reference counted multiple ownership, which were introduced in C 11.  Templates  C templates enable generic programming. C supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by instantiation at compile time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase Substitution failure is not an error . Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for generic programming, template metaprogramming, and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand. This is in contrast to run time generics seen in other languages where at compile time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved. Templates are different from macros: while both of these compile time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile time type definitions, and can perform high level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre compilation text substitution and text inclusion exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static polymorphism and generic programming. In addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C that is Turing complete, meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a template metaprogram prior to runtime. In summary, a template is a compile time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes from specific aspects without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.  Objects  C introduces object oriented programming features to C. It offers classes, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP languages: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. One distinguishing feature of C classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic destructors, which in turn provide support for the Resource Acquisition is Initialization concept.  Encapsulation  Encapsulation is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class . A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends. The object oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C supports not just object oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as modular programming. It is generally considered good practice to make all data private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.  Inheritance  Inheritance allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a base class may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by inheritance . The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a class inherits privately, while a struct inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called virtual inheritance. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is a C feature allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a Flying Cat class can inherit from both Cat and Flying Mammal . Some other languages, such as C or Java, accomplish something similar by allowing inheritance of multiple interfaces while restricting the number of base classes to one . An interface as in C and Java can be defined in C as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an abstract base class or ABC . The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called dominance.  Operators and operator overloading  C provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be overloaded for user defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user defined types in C seem like built in types. Overloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C programming techniques, such as smart pointers. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses . Overloaded  and  operators lose their short circuit evaluation property.  Polymorphism  Polymorphism enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances. C supports several kinds of static and dynamic polymorphisms, supported by the language features described above. Compile time polymorphism does not allow for certain run time decisions, while runtime polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty.  Static polymorphism  Function overloading allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments . The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and differing return types would result in a compile time error message. When declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a default value. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left to right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters. Templates in C provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code . In particular, through the curiously recurring template pattern, it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C templates are type aware and Turing complete, they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through template metaprogramming. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.  Dynamic polymorphism    Inheritance  Variable pointers and references to a base class type in C can also refer to objects of any derived classes of that type. This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types . This enables dynamic polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their types. C also provides the dynamic cast operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference pointer, to a more derived type: downcasting. The attempt is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. dynamic cast relies on run time type information , metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a dynamic cast to a pointer fails, the result is the nullptr constant, whereas if the destination is a reference , the cast throws an exception. Objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with static cast, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type checking of dynamic cast, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.   Virtual member functions  Ordinarily, when a function in a derived class overrides a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called dynamic dispatch. Virtual member functions or methods allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run time type of the object. In C implementations, this is commonly done using virtual function tables. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a fully qualified class name before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time. In addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. An inexact rule based on practical experience states that if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless, a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a clone virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called. A member function can also be made pure virtual by appending it with 0 after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an abstract class. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non pure definition of it before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill formed.  Lambda expressions  C provides support for anonymous functions, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form: Since C 20, you can write template parameters on a lambda without the keyword template: If the lambda takes no parameters, and no return type or other specifiers are used, the can be omitted, that is, The return type of a lambda expression can be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.: The capture list supports the definition of closures. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as syntactic sugar for an unnamed function object.  Exception handling  Exception handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled. It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors. Should an error occur, an exception is thrown , which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler. The exception causes the current scope to be exited, and also each outer scope until a suitable handler is found, calling in turn the destructors of any objects in these exited scopes. At the same time, an exception is presented as an object carrying the data about the detected problem.Some C style guides, such as Google's, LLVM's, and Qt's forbid the usage of exceptions. The exception causing code is placed inside a try block. The exceptions are handled in separate catch blocks ; each try block can have multiple exception handlers, as it is visible in the example below. It is also possible to raise exceptions purposefully, using the throw keyword; these exceptions are handled in the usual way. In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.Unlike signal handling, in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.  Enumerated types   Standard library  The C standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C ; it includes aggregate types , algorithms , input output facilities , filesystem library, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi threading library, atomics support , time utilities , a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C exceptions into C exceptions, a random number generator and a slightly modified version of the C standard library . A large part of the C library is based on the Standard Template Library . Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects , iterators that provide array like access to containers, and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting. Furthermore, maps and sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the features of the library are accessed by using the include directive to include a standard header. The C Standard Library provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated. The standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov, who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C , he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C features like using inlining and compile time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as STL , as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library .Most C compilers, and all major ones, provide a standards conforming implementation of the C standard library.  C Core Guidelines The C Core Guidelines are an initiative led by Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of C , and Herb Sutter, the convener and chair of the C ISO Working Group, to help programmers write 'Modern C ' by using best practices for the language standards C 11 and newer, and to help developers of compilers and static checking tools to create rules for catching bad programming practices. The main aim is to efficiently and consistently write type and resource safe C . The Core Guidelines were announced in the opening keynote at CPPCon 2015. The Guidelines are accompanied by the Guideline Support Library , a header only library of types and functions to implement the Core Guidelines and static checker tools for enforcing Guideline rules.  Compatibility To give compiler vendors greater freedom, the C standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems , though they seem to be largely abandoned now.  With C  C is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C . For example, C allows implicit conversion from void to other pointer types but C does not . Also, C defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers in a C program. Some incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard , which now supports C features such as line comments and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C , such as variable length arrays, native complex number types , designated initializers, compound literals, and the restrict keyword. Some of the C99 introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C standard, C 11 . However, the C 11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C. To intermix C and C code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from used both in C and C must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern C  ... block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling .  Criticism  Despite its widespread adoption, some notable programmers have criticized the C language, including Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Joshua Bloch, Ken Thompson and Donald Knuth. One of the most often criticised points of C is its perceived complexity as a language, with the criticism that a large number of non orthogonal features in practice necessitates restricting code to a subset of C , thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: I think C was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C says, Yes, we're using C but we're not doing multiple implementation inheritance and we're not using operator overloading. There are just a bunch of features that you're not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don't think it's good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else's code, which I think is such a good thing. Donald Knuth , who said of Edsger Dijkstra that to think of programming in C  would make him physically ill : The problem that I have with them today is that... C is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said OK, we'll do them both . So the language is too baroque for my taste. Ken Thompson, who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment: It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it's a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it's just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it's personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it's not a good language to transport an algorithm to say, I wrote it; here, take it. It's way too big, way too complex. And it's obviously built by a committee. Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said no to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn't cleanly designed it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that. However Brian Kernighan, also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment: C has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C programs. Stroustrup himself comments that C semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: within C , there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out .Other complaints may include a lack of reflection or garbage collection, long compilation times, perceived feature creep, and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.

            "text": "A carbon star is typically an asymptotic giant branch star, a luminous red giant, whose atmosphere contains more carbon than oxygen. The two elements combine in the upper layers of the star, forming carbon monoxide, which consumes most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, leaving carbon atoms free to form other carbon compounds, giving the star a sooty atmosphere and a strikingly ruby red appearance. There are also some dwarf and supergiant carbon stars, with the more common giant stars sometimes being called classical carbon stars to distinguish them. In most stars , the atmosphere is richer in oxygen than carbon. Ordinary stars not exhibiting the characteristics of carbon stars but cool enough to form carbon monoxide are therefore called oxygen rich stars. Carbon stars have quite distinctive spectral characteristics, and they were first recognized by their spectra by Angelo Secchi in the 1860s, a pioneering time in astronomical spectroscopy.  Spectra  By definition carbon stars have dominant spectral Swan bands from the molecule C2. Many other carbon compounds may be present at high levels, such as CH, CN , C3 and SiC2. Carbon is formed in the core and circulated into its upper layers, dramatically changing the layers' composition. In addition to carbon, S process elements such as barium, technetium, and zirconium are formed in the shell flashes and are dredged up to the surface.When astronomers developed the spectral classification of the carbon stars, they had considerable difficulty when trying to correlate the spectra to the stars' effective temperatures. The trouble was with all the atmospheric carbon hiding the absorption lines normally used as temperature indicators for the stars. Carbon stars also show a rich spectrum of molecular lines at millimeter wavelengths and submillimeter wavelengths. In the carbon star CW Leonis more than 50 different circumstellar molecules have been detected. This star is often used to search for new circumstellar molecules.  Secchi  Carbon stars were discovered already in the 1860s when spectral classification pioneer Angelo Secchi erected the Secchi class IV for the carbon stars, which in the late 1890s were reclassified as N class stars.  Harvard  Using this new Harvard classification, the N class was later enhanced by an R class for less deeply red stars sharing the characteristic carbon bands of the spectrum. Later correlation of this R to N scheme with conventional spectra, showed that the R N sequence approximately run in parallel with c:a G7 to M10 with regards to star temperature.  Morgan Keenan C system  The later N classes correspond less well to the counterparting M types, because the Harvard classification was only partially based on temperature, but also carbon abundance; so it soon became clear that this kind of carbon star classification was incomplete. Instead a new dual number star class C was erected so to deal with temperature and carbon abundance. Such a spectrum measured for Y Canum Venaticorum, was determined to be C54, where 5 refers to temperature dependent features, and 4 to the strength of the C2 Swan bands in the spectrum. . This Morgan Keenan C system classification replaced the older R N classifications from 1960 to 1993.  The Revised Morgan Keenan system  The two dimensional Morgan Keenan C classification failed to fulfill the creators' expectations: it failed to correlate to temperature measurements based on infrared, originally being two dimensional it was soon enhanced by suffixes, CH, CN, j and other features making it impractical for en masse analyses of foreign galaxies' carbon star populations, and it gradually occurred that the old R and N stars actually were two distinct types of carbon stars, having real astrophysical significance.A new revised Morgan Keenan classification was published in 1993 by Philip Keenan, defining the classes: C N, C R and C H. Later the classes C J and C Hd were added. This constitutes the established classification system used today.  Astrophysical mechanisms Carbon stars can be explained by more than one astrophysical mechanism. Classical carbon stars are distinguished from non classical ones on the grounds of mass, with classical carbon stars being the more massive.In the classical carbon stars, those belonging to the modern spectral types C R and C N, the abundance of carbon is thought to be a product of helium fusion, specifically the triple alpha process within a star, which giants reach near the end of their lives in the asymptotic giant branch . These fusion products have been brought to the stellar surface by episodes of convection after the carbon and other products were made. Normally this kind of AGB carbon star fuses hydrogen in a hydrogen burning shell, but in episodes separated by 104 105 years, the star transforms to burning helium in a shell, while the hydrogen fusion temporarily ceases. In this phase, the star's luminosity rises, and material from the interior of the star moves up. Since the luminosity rises, the star expands so that the helium fusion ceases, and the hydrogen shell burning restarts. During these shell helium flashes, the mass loss from the star is significant, and after many shell helium flashes, an AGB star is transformed into a hot white dwarf and its atmosphere becomes material for a planetary nebula. The non classical kinds of carbon stars, belonging to the types C J and C H, are believed to be binary stars, where one star is observed to be a giant star and the other a white dwarf. The star presently observed to be a giant star accreted carbon rich material when it was still a main sequence star from its companion when the latter was still a classical carbon star. That phase of stellar evolution is relatively brief, and most such stars ultimately end up as white dwarfs. These systems are now being observed a comparatively long time after the mass transfer event, so the extra carbon observed in the present red giant was not produced within that star. This scenario is also accepted as the origin of the barium stars, which are also characterized as having strong spectral features of carbon molecules and of barium . Sometimes the stars whose excess carbon came from this mass transfer are called extrinsic carbon stars to distinguish them from the intrinsic AGB stars which produce the carbon internally. Many of these extrinsic carbon stars are not luminous or cool enough to have made their own carbon, which was a puzzle until their binary nature was discovered. The enigmatic hydrogen deficient carbon stars , belonging to the spectral class C Hd, seems to have some relation to R Coronae Borealis variables , but are not variable themselves and lack a certain infrared radiation typical for RCB:s. Only five HdC:s are known, and none is known to be binary, so the relation to the non classical carbon stars is not known. Other less convincing theories, such as CNO cycle unbalancing and core helium flash have also been proposed as mechanisms for carbon enrichment in the atmospheres of smaller carbon stars.  Other characteristics  Most classical carbon stars are variable stars of the long period variable types.  Observing carbon stars  Due to the insensitivity of night vision to red and a slow adaption of the red sensitive eye rods to the light of the stars, astronomers making magnitude estimates of red variable stars, especially carbon stars, have to know how to deal with the Purkinje effect in order not to underestimate the magnitude of the observed star.  Generation of interstellar dust  Owing to its low surface gravity, as much as half of the total mass of a carbon star may be lost by way of powerful stellar winds. The star's remnants, carbon rich dust similar to graphite, therefore become part of the interstellar dust. This dust is believed to be a significant factor in providing the raw materials for the creation of subsequent generations of stars and their planetary systems. The material surrounding a carbon star may blanket it to the extent that the dust absorbs all visible light.

            "text": "In phonetics, an r colored or rhotic vowel is a vowel that is modified in a way that results in a lowering in frequency of the third formant. R colored vowels can be articulated in various ways: the tip or blade of the tongue may be turned up during at least part of the articulation of the vowel or the back of the tongue may be bunched. In addition, the vocal tract may often be constricted in the region of the epiglottis.R colored vowels are exceedingly rare, occurring in less than one percent of all languages. However, they occur in two of the most widely spoken languages: North American English and Mandarin Chinese. In North American English, they are found in words such as dollar, butter, third, color, and nurse. They also occur in Canadian French, some varieties of Portuguese, some Jutlandic dialects of Danish, as well as in a few indigenous languages of the Americas and of Asia, including Serrano and Yurok in the United States, Luobohe Miao in China, and Badaga in India.  Notation In the IPA, an r colored vowel is indicated by a hook diacritic  placed to the right of the regular symbol for the vowel. For example, the IPA symbol for schwa is , while the IPA symbol for an r colored schwa is . This diacritic is the hook of , a symbol constructed by John Samuel Kenyon along with  by adding the retroflex hook to  and . Both  and  were proposed as IPA symbols by editors of the American Speech in 1939 to distinguish it from  .The IPA adopted several ways to transcribe r colored vowels in its 1947 chart: the turned r ; the superscript turned r  , a , e ,  , etc.; the retroflex hook , , , , etc.; and added  as a variant of  in its 1951 chart. In 1976 the retroflex hook was dropped due to insufficient usage. In 1989, at the Kiel Convention, the hook of  and  was adopted as a diacritic placed on the right side of the vowel symbol for r colored vowels, e.g.  o  . Following the convention of alternating  and  for non rhotic accents,  and  signify stressed and unstressed, respectively, rather than a difference in phonetic quality. The use of the superscript turned r is still commonly seen.  Examples   English  R colored vowels are found in most rhotic forms of English, including General American and Irish English. The r colored vowels of General American can be written with vowel r digraphs: : hearse, assert, mirth ; standard, dinner, Lincolnshire  : start, car  : north, warIn words such as start, many speakers have r coloring only in the coda of the vowel, rather than as a simultaneous articulation modifying the whole duration. This can be represented in IPA by using a succession of two symbols such as  or  , rather than the unitary symbol  .  Singing  In European classical singing, dropping or weakening of r colored vowels has been nearly universal and is a standard part of classical vocal training. However, there have always been other singing styles in which r colored vowels are given their full emphasis, including traditional Irish singing styles and those of many performers of country music. In certain particular cases, a vowel r is pronounced instead as two syllables: a non rhotic vowel followed by a syllabic r .  Mandarin Chinese  In Mandarin, the rhotacized ending of some words is the prime way by which to distinguish speakers of Standard Northern Mandarin and Southwestern Mandarin from those of other forms of Mandarin in China. Mandarin speakers call this phenomenon erhua. In many words, the r suffix is added to indicate some meaning changes. If the word ends in a velar nasal , the final consonant is lost and the vowel becomes nasalized. Major cities that have this form of rhotacized ending include Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, and Qiqihar. This erhua has since spread to other provincial capitals not home to Standard Mandarin, such as Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Xian, Chongqing, and Chengdu. In rhotic accents of Standard Mandarin, such as those from Beijing, Tianjin, most of the Hebei province , eastern Inner Mongolia , and in the Northeast, vocalic r occurs as a diminutive marker of nouns and the perfective aspect particle . This also occurs in the middle syllables of compound words consisting of three or more syllables. For example, the name of the famous restaurant Go Believe in Tianjin is pronounced as 'Gourbli' b l G urbl . The name of the street Dazhalan in Beijing is pronounced as 'Da shi lar'  D sh l r .  Quebec French  In Quebec French, the vowel  is generally pronounced  and the r colored vowels are also pronounced in loan words. For example, the word hamburger can be pronounced amb , the word soccer can be pronounced s k etc.  Other examples  In the 1930s the Dravidian language Badaga had two degrees of rhoticity among all five of its vowels, but few speakers maintain the distinction today, and then only in one or two vowels. An example is non rhotic be mouth , slightly rhotacized be bangle , and fully rhotacized be  crop .The Algic language Yurok illustrated rhotic vowel harmony. The non high vowels a , e and o could become  in a word that has . For example, the root nahks 'three' became n hks in the word n hks j 'three '.Luobohe Miao also contains .

            "text": "In chemistry, pH , historically denoting potential of hydrogen , is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Acidic solutions are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions. The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution.         pH          log             log          displaystyle ce pH  log log  where M mol dm 3. At 25 C , solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Solutions with a pH of 7 at this temperature are neutral . The neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature being lower than 7 if the temperature increases above 25 C. The pH value can be less than 0 for very concentrated strong acids, or greater than 14 for very concentrated strong bases.The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement. Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or a color changing indicator. Measurements of pH are important in chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water treatment, and many other applications.  History The concept of pH was first introduced by the Danish chemist S ren Peder Lauritz S rensen at the Carlsberg Laboratory in 1909 and was revised to the modern pH in 1924 to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of electrochemical cells. In the first papers, the notation had H as a subscript to the lowercase p, thus: pH . For the sign p, I propose the name 'hydrogen ion exponent' and the symbol pH . Then, for the hydrogen ion exponent of a solution, the negative value of the Briggsian logarithm of the related hydrogen ion normality factor is to be understood. The exact meaning of the letter p in pH is disputed, as S rensen did not explain why he used it. S rensen describes a way of measuring pH using potential differences, and it represents the negative power of 10 in the concentration of hydrogen ions. The letter p could stand for the French puissance, German Potenz, or Danish potens, meaning power , or it could mean potential . All the words for these start with the letter p in French, German, and Danish all languages S rensen published in: Carlsberg Laboratory was French speaking, German was the dominant language of scientific publishing, and S rensen was Danish. He also used the letter q in much the same way elsewhere in the paper. He might also just have labelled the test solution p and the reference solution q arbitrarily; these letters are often paired. Some literature sources state that the pH stands for the Latin term pondus hydrogenii or potentia hydrogenii , although this is not supported by S rensen's writings.Currently in chemistry, the p stands for decimal logarithm of , and is also used in the term pKa, used for acid dissociation constants and pOH, the equivalent for hydroxide ions. Bacteriologist Alice C. Evans, famed for her work's influence on dairying and food safety, credited William Mansfield Clark and colleagues with developing pH measuring methods in the 1910s, which had a wide influence on laboratory and industrial use thereafter. In her memoir, she does not mention how much, or how little, Clark and colleagues knew about S rensen's work a few years prior.: 10 She said: In these studies of bacterial metabolism Dr. Clark's attention was directed to the effect of acid on the growth of bacteria. He found that it is the intensity of the acid in terms of hydrogen ion concentration that affects their growth. But existing methods of measuring acidity determined the quantity, not the intensity, of the acid. Next, with his collaborators, Dr. Clark developed accurate methods for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. These methods replaced the inaccurate titration method of determining the acid content in use in biologic laboratories throughout the world. Also they were found to be applicable in many industrial and other processes in which they came into wide usage.: 10 The first electronic method for measuring pH was invented by Arnold Orville Beckman, a professor at California Institute of Technology in 1934. It was in response to local citrus grower Sunkist that wanted a better method for quickly testing the pH of lemons they were picking from their nearby orchards.  Definition and measurement   pH  pH is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity, aH , in a solution.         pH             log      10                  log      10                    displaystyle ce pH  log 10 log 10 left  For example, for a solution with a hydrogen ion activity of 5 10 6 the argument of the logarithm is 1  2 105; thus such a solution has a pH of log10 5.3. Consider the following example: a quantity of 107 moles of pure water at 25 C , or 180 metric tonnes , contains close to 18 milligrams of dissociated hydrogen ions. Note that pH depends on temperature. For instance at 0 C the pH of pure water is about 7.47. At 25 C it is 7.00, and at 100 C it is 6.14. This definition was adopted because ion selective electrodes, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. Ideally, the electrode potential, E, follows the Nernst equation, which for the hydrogen ion can be written as       E        E      0                    R    T       F        ln             E      0                    2.303    R    T       F          pH       displaystyle E E 0 frac RT F ln E 0 frac 2.303RT F ce pH  where E is a measured potential, E0 is the standard electrode potential, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, F is the Faraday constant. For H the number of electrons transferred is one. It follows that the electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity. Precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard ISO 31 8 as follows: A galvanic cell is set up to measure the electromotive force between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a silver chloride electrode or a calomel electrode. The hydrogen ion selective electrode is a standard hydrogen electrode. Reference electrode concentrated solution of KCl test solution H2 PtFirstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the electromotive force, ES, is measured. Then the electromotive force, EX, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.         pH                   pH                              E               S                         E               X                    z          displaystyle ce pH  ce pH  frac E ce S E ce X  z  The difference between the two measured electromotive force values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1 z, is ideally equal to             1       2.303    R    T                F                displaystyle frac 1 2.303RT F  , the Nernstian slope . To apply this process in practice, a glass electrode is used rather than the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in built reference electrode. It is calibrated against buffer solutions of known hydrogen ion activity. IUPAC has proposed the use of a set of buffer solutions of known H activity. Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the slope may differ slightly from ideal. To implement this approach to calibration, the electrode is first immersed in a standard solution and the reading on a pH meter is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer's value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted, using the slope control, to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the IUPAC recommendations. When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25 C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures. The pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a dimensionless quantity.  P H  This was the original definition of S rensen in 1909, which was superseded in favor of pH in 1924. H is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted H in modern chemistry, which appears to have units of concentration. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of H in dilute solution should be replaced by H c0, where the standard state concentration c0 1 mol L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined. However, it is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly, if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One way to do this, which has been used extensively, is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong alkaline in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. Since the concentrations of acid and alkaline are known, it is easy to calculate the concentration of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a Gran plot. Thus, the effect of using this procedure is to make activity equal to the numerical value of concentration. The glass electrode should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition, as detailed below. The difference between p H and pH is quite small. It has been stated that pH p H 0.04. It is common practice to use the term pH for both types of measurement.  pH indicators  Indicators may be used to measure pH, by making use of the fact that their color changes with pH. Visual comparison of the color of a test solution with a standard color chart provides a means to measure pH accurate to the nearest whole number. More precise measurements are possible if the color is measured spectrophotometrically, using a colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Universal indicator consists of a mixture of indicators such that there is a continuous color change from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with universal indicator. Another method of measuring pH is using an electronic pH meter.  pOH  pOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions, OH . pOH values are derived from pH measurements. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by               OH                                 K             W                                H                                        displaystyle ce OH  frac K ce W  ce H   where KW is the self ionization constant of water. Taking logarithms         pOH          p        K          W                pH       displaystyle ce pOH  ce p K ce W  ce pH  So, at room temperature, pOH 14 pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of soil alkalinity.  Extremes of pH  Measurement of pH below about 2.5 and above about 10.5 requires special procedures because, when using the glass electrode, the Nernst law breaks down under those conditions. Various factors contribute to this. It cannot be assumed that liquid junction potentials are independent of pH. Also, extreme pH implies that the solution is concentrated, so electrode potentials are affected by ionic strength variation. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by alkaline error , because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as Na and K in the solution. Specially constructed electrodes are available which partly overcome these problems. Runoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some very low pH values.  Non aqueous solutions  Hydrogen ion concentrations can be measured in non aqueous solvents. pH values based on these measurements belong to a different scale from aqueous pH values, because activities relate to different standard states. Hydrogen ion activity, aH , can be defined as:         a              H                               exp               displaystyle a ce H  exp left  where H is the chemical potential of the hydrogen ion,                        H                                        displaystyle mu  ce H  ominus  is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, R is the gas constant and T is the thermodynamic temperature. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly due to different solvated proton ions such as lyonium ions, requiring an intersolvent scale which involves the transfer activity coefficient of hydronium lyonium ion. pH is an example of an acidity function. Other acidity functions can be defined. For example, the Hammett acidity function, H0, has been developed in connection with superacids.  Unified absolute pH scale  In 2010, a new unified absolute pH scale has been proposed that would allow various pH ranges across different solutions to use a common proton reference standard. It has been developed on the basis of the absolute chemical potential of the proton. This model uses the Lewis acid base definition. This scale applies to liquids, gases and even solids.  Applications Pure water is neutral. When an acid is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7 . When a base, or specifically an alkali, is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at concentration 1 mol dm 3 has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, at concentration 1 mol dm 3, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. The pH of neutrality is not exactly 7 , although this is a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where H  OH . Since self ionization of water holds the product of these concentration H M OH M Kw, it can be seen that at neutrality H M OH M Kw, or pH pKw 2. pKw is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since dissociation of water produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic strength, so Kw varies with ionic strength. If pure water is exposed to air it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which is then slowly converted into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions . CO2 H2O HCO 3 H  pH in soil   Classification of soil pH ranges  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows: In Europe, topsoil pH is influenced by soil parent material, erosional effects, climate and vegetation. A recent map of topsoil pH in Europe shows the alkaline soils in Mediterranean, Hungary, East Romania, North France. Scandinavian countries, Portugal, Poland and North Germany have more acid soils.  Measuring soil pH  Soil in the field is a heterogeneous colloidal system that comprises sand, silt, clays, microorganisms, plant roots, and myriad other living cells and decaying organic material. Soil pH is a master variable that affects myriad processes and properties of interest to soil and environmental scientists, farmers, and engineers. To quantify the concentration of the H in such a complex system, soil samples from a given soil horizon are brought to the laboratory where they are homogenized, sieved, and sometimes dried prior to analysis. A mass of soil is mixed into a slurry with distilled water or 0.01 M CaCl2 . After mixing well, the suspension is stirred vigorously and allowed to stand for 15 20 minutes, during which time, the sand and silt particles settle out and the clays and other colloids remain suspended in the overlying water, known as the aqueous phase. A pH electrode connected to a pH meter is calibrated with buffered solutions of known pH before being inserting into the upper portion of the aqueous phase, and the pH is measured. A combination pH electrode incorporates both the H sensing electrode and a reference electrode that provides a pH insensitive reference voltage and a salt bridge to the hydrogen electrode. In other configurations, the glass and reference electrodes are separate and attach to the pH meter in two ports. The pH meter measures the potential difference between the two electrodes and converts it to pH. The separate reference electrode is usually the calomel electrode, the silver silver chloride electrode is used in the combination electrode.There are numerous uncertainties in operationally defining soil pH in the above way. Since an electrical potential difference between the glass and reference electrodes is what is measured, the activity of H is really being quantified, rather than concentration. The H activity is sometimes called the effective H concentration and is directly related to the chemical potential of the proton and its ability to do chemical and electrical work in the soil solution in equilibrium with the solid phases. Clay and organic matter particles carry negative charge on their surfaces, and H ions attracted to them are in equilibrium with H ions in the soil solution. The measured pH is quantified in the aqueous phase only, by definition, but the value obtained is affected by the presence and nature of the soil colloids and the ionic strength of the aqueous phase. Changing the water to soil ratio in the slurry can change the pH by disturbing the water colloid equilibrium, particularly the ionic strength. The use of 0.01 M CaCl2 instead of water obviates this effect of water to soil ratio and gives a more consistent approximation of soil pH that relates to plant root growth, rhizosphere and microbial activity, drainage water acidity, and chemical processes in the soil. Using 0.01 M CaCl2 brings all of the soluble ions in the aqueous phase closer to the colloidal surfaces, and allows the H activity to be measured closer to them. Using the 0.01 M CaCl2 solution thereby allows a more consistent, quantitative estimation of H activity, especially if diverse soil samples are being compared in space and time.  pH in nature  pH dependent plant pigments that can be used as pH indicators occur in many plants, including hibiscus, red cabbage , and grapes . The juice of citrus fruits is acidic mainly because it contains citric acid. Other carboxylic acids occur in many living systems. For example, lactic acid is produced by muscle activity. The state of protonation of phosphate derivatives, such as ATP, is pH dependent. The functioning of the oxygen transport enzyme hemoglobin is affected by pH in a process known as the Root effect.  Seawater  The pH of seawater is typically limited to a range between 7.4 and 8.5. It plays an important role in the ocean's carbon cycle, and there is evidence of ongoing ocean acidification caused by carbon dioxide emissions. However, pH measurement is complicated by the chemical properties of seawater, and several distinct pH scales exist in chemical oceanography.As part of its operational definition of the pH scale, the IUPAC defines a series of buffer solutions across a range of pH values . These solutions have a relatively low ionic strength compared to that of seawater , and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in electrode potential. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on artificial seawater was developed. This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the 'total scale', often denoted as pHT. The total scale was defined using a medium containing sulfate ions. These ions experience protonation, H SO2 4 HSO 4, such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons and hydrogen sulfate ions: H T H F HSO 4 An alternative scale, the 'free scale', often denoted 'pHF', omits this consideration and focuses solely on H F, in principle making it a simpler representation of hydrogen ion concentration. Only H T can be determined, therefore H F must be estimated using the SO2 4 and the stability constant of HSO 4, K S: H F H T HSO 4  H T 1However, it is difficult to estimate K S in seawater, limiting the utility of the otherwise more straightforward free scale. Another scale, known as the 'seawater scale', often denoted 'pHSWS', takes account of a further protonation relationship between hydrogen ions and fluoride ions, H F HF. Resulting in the following expression for H SWS: H SWS H F HSO 4  HF However, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small. The following three equations summarise the three scales of pH: pHF log H F pHT log  log H T pHSWS log  log v SWSIn practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their values by up to 0.10 pH units, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean's carbonate system. Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the free scale is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.  Living systems  The pH of different cellular compartments, body fluids, and organs is usually tightly regulated in a process called acid base homeostasis. The most common disorder in acid base homeostasis is acidosis, which means an acid overload in the body, generally defined by pH falling below 7.35. Alkalosis is the opposite condition, with blood pH being excessively high. The pH of blood is usually slightly basic with a value of pH 7.365. This value is often referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. Plaque can create a local acidic environment that can result in tooth decay by demineralization. Enzymes and other proteins have an optimum pH range and can become inactivated or denatured outside this range.  Calculations of pH The calculation of the pH of a solution containing acids and or bases is an example of a chemical speciation calculation, that is, a mathematical procedure for calculating the concentrations of all chemical species that are present in the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. For strong acids and bases no calculations are necessary except in extreme situations. The pH of a solution containing a weak acid requires the solution of a quadratic equation. The pH of a solution containing a weak base may require the solution of a cubic equation. The general case requires the solution of a set of non linear simultaneous equations. A complicating factor is that water itself is a weak acid and a weak base . It dissociates according to the equilibrium 2 H2O  H3O  OH with a dissociation constant, Kw defined as         K      w                       H                                   OH                                        M         2          displaystyle K w ce H OH   ce M 2  where H stands for the concentration of the aqueous hydronium ion and OH represents the concentration of the hydroxide ion. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.  Strong acids and bases  Strong acids and bases are compounds that for practical purposes, are completely dissociated in water. Under normal circumstances this means that the concentration of hydrogen ions in acidic solution can be taken to be equal to the concentration of the acid. The pH is then equal to minus the logarithm of the concentration value. Hydrochloric acid is an example of a strong acid. The pH of a 0.01M solution of HCl is equal to log10 , that is, pH 2. Sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is an example of a strong base. The p OH value of a 0.01M solution of NaOH is equal to log10 , that is, p OH 2. From the definition of p OH in the pOH section above, this means that the pH is equal to about 12. For solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations the self ionization equilibrium must be taken into account. Self ionization must also be considered when concentrations are extremely low. Consider, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 5 10 8M. The simple procedure given above would suggest that it has a pH of 7.3. This is clearly wrong as an acid solution should have a pH of less than 7. Treating the system as a mixture of hydrochloric acid and the amphoteric substance water, a pH of 6.89 results.  Weak acids and bases  A weak acid or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism. Acid HA: HA  H A Base A: HA  H AFirst, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality         K      a                             H                     A                            HA                      displaystyle K a frac ce H A  ce HA   and its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, HA , H and A to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of mass conservation in terms of the two reagents H and A.         C          A                       A                       HA              displaystyle C ce A  ce A  ce HA           C          H                       H                       HA              displaystyle C ce H  ce H  ce HA  C stands for analytical concentration. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining Ka, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water CA CH Ca, the concentration of the acid, so A  H . After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.            H              2             K      a             H             K      a          C      a          0     displaystyle ce H  2 K a ce H K a C a 0 Solution of this quadratic equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p H or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an ICE table which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when CA CH. For example, what is the pH of a 0.01M solution of benzoic acid, pKa 4.19? Step 1:         K      a             10          4.19          6.46        10          5          displaystyle K a 10 4.19 6.46 times 10 5  Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation.            H              2          6.46        10          5             H          6.46        10          7          0     displaystyle ce H  2 6.46 times 10 5 ce H 6.46 times 10 7 0  Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation.               H                       7.74        10          4        ;        p   H       3.11     displaystyle ce H  7.74 times 10 4 ; quad mathrm pH 3.11 For alkaline solutions an additional term is added to the mass balance equation for hydrogen. Since addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self ionization equilibrium to be equal to                K        w                            H                                         displaystyle frac K w  ce H            C      H                            H                        HA                    K         w                       H                 displaystyle C ce H  frac  ce H  ce HA K w ce H  In this case the resulting equation in H is a cubic equation.  General method  Some systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations. With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as ApBqHr,the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution. For example, with three reagents, each equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant, .               A         p              B         q              H         r                      p    q    r             A              p             B              q             H              r          displaystyle ce A p ce B q ce H r beta pqr ce A  p ce B  q ce H  r  Next, write down the mass balance equations for each reagent:                         C          A                                       A                      p                    p      q      r                       A                        p                       B                        q                       H                        r                                C          B                                       B                      q                    p      q      r                       A                        p                       B                        q                       H                        r                                C          H                                       H                      r                    p      q      r                       A                        p                       B                        q                       H                        r                       K          w                       H                             1                          displaystyle begin aligned C ce A  ce A  Sigma p beta pqr ce A  p ce B  q ce H  r C ce B  ce B  Sigma q beta pqr ce A  p ce B  q ce H  r C ce H  ce H  Sigma r beta pqr ce A  p ce B  q ce H  r K w ce H  1 end aligned  Note that there are no approximations involved in these equations, except that each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations, not activities. Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used. There are 3 non linear simultaneous equations in the three unknowns, A , B and H . Because the equations are non linear, and because concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this formalism, is a key element in the determination of equilibrium constants by potentiometric titration.

            "text": "Visual Basic, originally called Visual Basic .NET , is a multi paradigm, object oriented programming language, implemented on .NET, Mono, and the .NET Framework. Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0. Although the .NET portion of the name was dropped in 2005, this article uses Visual Basic .NET to refer to all Visual Basic languages released since 2002, in order to distinguish between them and the classic Visual Basic. Along with C and F , it is one of the three main languages targeting the .NET ecosystem. As of March 11, 2020, Microsoft announced that evolution of the VB.NET language has concluded.Microsoft's integrated development environment for developing in Visual Basic is Visual Studio. Most Visual Studio editions are commercial; the only exceptions are Visual Studio Express and Visual Studio Community, which are freeware. In addition, the .NET Framework SDK includes a freeware command line compiler called vbc.exe. Mono also includes a command line VB.NET compiler. Visual Basic is often used in conjunction with the Windows Forms GUI library to make desktop apps for Windows. Programming for Windows Forms with Visual Basic involves dragging and dropping controls on a form using a GUI designer and writing corresponding code for each control.  Syntax Visual Basic uses statements to specify actions. The most common statement is an expression statement, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, on a single line. As part of that evaluation, functions or subroutines may be called and variables may be assigned new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, Visual Basic provides several control flow statements identified by reserved keywords. Structured programming is supported by several constructs including two conditional execution constructs and three iterative execution constructs . The For ... To statement has separate initialisation and testing sections, both of which must be present. The For Each statement steps through each value in a list. In addition, in Visual Basic: There is no unified way of defining blocks of statements. Instead, certain keywords, such as If Then or Sub are interpreted as starters of sub blocks of code and have matching termination keywords such as End If or End Sub . Statements are terminated either with a colon or with the end of line. Multiple line statements in Visual Basic are enabled with  at the end of each such line. The need for the underscore continuation character was largely removed in version 10 and later versions. The equals sign is used in both assigning values to variables and in comparison. Round brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them. Visual Basic uses round brackets to define the parameters of subroutines or functions. A single quotation mark or the keyword REM, placed at the beginning of a line or after any number of space or tab characters at the beginning of a line, or after other code on a line, indicates that the line is a comment.  Simple example  The following is a very simple Visual Basic program, a version of the classic Hello, World! example created as a console application: It prints Hello, World! on a command line window. Each line serves a specific purpose, as follows: This is a module definition. Modules are a division of code, which can contain any kind of object, like constants or variables, functions or methods, or classes, but can't be instantiated as objects like classes and cannot inherit from other modules. Modules serve as containers of code that can be referenced from other parts of a program.It is common practice for a module and the code file which contains it to have the same name. However, this is not required, as a single code file may contain more than one module and or class. This line defines a subroutine called Main . Main is the entry point, where the program begins execution. This line performs the actual task of writing the output. Console is a system object, representing a command line interface and granting programmatic access to the operating system's standard streams. The program calls the Console method WriteLine, which causes the string passed to it to be displayed on the console. Instead of Console.WriteLine, one could use MsgBox, which prints the message in a dialog box instead of a command line window.  Complex example  This piece of code outputs Floyd's Triangle to the console:  Comparison with the classic Visual Basic  Whether Visual Basic .NET should be considered as just another version of Visual Basic or a completely different language is a topic of debate. There are new additions to support new features, such as structured exception handling and short circuited expressions. Also, two important data type changes occurred with the move to VB.NET: compared to Visual Basic 6, the Integer data type has been doubled in length from 16 bits to 32 bits, and the Long data type has been doubled in length from 32 bits to 64 bits. This is true for all versions of VB.NET. A 16 bit integer in all versions of VB.NET is now known as a Short. Similarly, the Windows Forms editor is very similar in style and function to the Visual Basic form editor. The things that have changed significantly are the semantics from those of an object based programming language running on a deterministic, reference counted engine based on COM to a fully object oriented language backed by the .NET Framework, which consists of a combination of the Common Language Runtime and a far larger class library. The increased breadth of the latter is also a problem that VB developers have to deal with when coming to the language, although this is somewhat addressed by the My feature in Visual Studio 2005. The changes have altered many underlying assumptions about the right thing to do with respect to performance and maintainability. Some functions and libraries no longer exist; others are available, but not as efficient as the native .NET alternatives. Even if they compile, most converted Visual Basic 6 applications will require some level of refactoring to take full advantage of the new language. Documentation is available to cover changes in the syntax, debugging applications, deployment and terminology.  Comparative examples  The following simple examples compare VB and VB.NET syntax. They assume that the developer has created a form, placed a button on it and has associated the subroutines demonstrated in each example with the click event handler of the mentioned button. Each example creates a Hello, World message box after the button on the form is clicked. Visual Basic 6: VB.NET : Both Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic .NET automatically generate the Sub and End Sub statements when the corresponding button is double clicked in design view. Visual Basic .NET will also generate the necessary Class and End Class statements. The developer need only add the statement to display the Hello, World message box. All procedure calls must be made with parentheses in VB.NET, whereas in Visual Basic 6 there were different conventions for functions and subs . The names Command1 and Button1 are not obligatory. However, these are default names for a command button in Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET respectively. In VB.NET, the Handles keyword is used to make the sub Button1 Click a handler for the Click event of the object Button1. In Visual Basic 6, event handler subs must have a specific name consisting of the object's name , an underscore , and the event's name . There is a function called MessageBox.Show in the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace which can be used similarly to the corresponding function in Visual Basic 6. There is a controversy about which function to use as a best practice . Some programmers prefer to do things the .NET way , since the Framework classes have more features and are less language specific. Others argue that using language specific features makes code more readable or Integer instead of System.Int32 . In Visual Basic 2008, the inclusion of ByVal sender as Object, ByVal e as EventArgs has become optional.The following example demonstrates a difference between Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET. Both examples close the active window. Visual Basic 6: VB.NET: The 'cmd' prefix is replaced by the 'btn' prefix, conforming to the new convention previously mentioned.Visual Basic 6 did not provide common operator shortcuts. The following are equivalent: Visual Basic 6: VB.NET:  Comparison with C  C and Visual Basic are Microsoft's first languages made to program on the .NET Framework . Though C and Visual Basic are syntactically different, that is where the differences mostly end. Microsoft developed both of these languages to be part of the same .NET Framework development platform. They are both developed, managed, and supported by the same language development team at Microsoft. They compile to the same intermediate language , which runs against the same .NET Framework runtime libraries. Although there are some differences in the programming constructs, their differences are primarily syntactic and, assuming one avoids the Visual Basic Compatibility libraries provided by Microsoft to aid conversion from Visual Basic 6, almost every feature in VB has an equivalent feature in C and vice versa. Lastly, both languages reference the same Base Classes of the .NET Framework to extend their functionality. As a result, with few exceptions, a program written in either language can be run through a simple syntax converter to translate to the other. There are many open source and commercially available products for this task.  Examples   Hello World!   Windows Forms Application  Requires a button called Button1.  Console Application   Speaking   Windows Forms Application  Requires a TextBox titled 'TextBox1' and a button called Button1.  Console Application   Version history Succeeding the classic Visual Basic version 6.0, the first version of Visual Basic .NET debuted in 2002. As of 2020, ten versions of Visual Basic .NET are released.  2002  The first version, Visual Basic .NET, relies on .NET Framework 1.0. The most important feature is managed code, which contrasts with the classic Visual Basic.  2003  Visual Basic .NET 2003 was released with .NET Framework 1.1. New features included support for the .NET Compact Framework and a better VB upgrade wizard. Improvements were also made to the performance and reliability of .NET IDE and runtime. In addition, Visual Basic .NET 2003 was available in the Visual Studio.NET Academic Edition, distributed to a certain number of scholars from each country without cost.  2005  After Visual Basic .NET 2003, Microsoft dropped .NET from the name of the product, calling the next version Visual Basic 2005. For this release, Microsoft added many features intended to reinforce Visual Basic .NET's focus as a rapid application development platform and further differentiate it from C ., including: Edit and Continue feature Design time expression evaluation A pseudo namespace called My , which provides:Easy access to certain areas of the .NET Framework that otherwise require significant code to access like using My.Form2.Text  MainForm rather than System.WindowsApplication1.Forms.Form2.text  MainForm Dynamically generated classes Improved VB to VB.NET converter A using keyword, simplifying the use of objects that require the Dispose pattern to free resources Just My Code feature, which hides boilerplate code written by the Visual Studio .NET IDE and system library code during debugging Data Source binding, easing database client server developmentTo bridge the gaps between itself and other .NET languages, this version added: Generics Partial classes, a method of defining some parts of a class in one file and then adding more definitions later; particularly useful for integrating user code with auto generated code Operator overloading and nullable types Support for unsigned integer data types commonly used in other languagesVisual Basic 2005 introduced the IsNot operator that makes 'If X IsNot Y' equivalent to 'If Not X Is Y'. It gained notoriety when it was found to be the subject of a Microsoft patent application.  2008  Visual Basic 9.0 was released along with .NET Framework 3.5 on November 19, 2007. For this release, Microsoft added many features, including: A true conditional operator, If , to replace the IIf function. Anonymous types Support for LINQ Lambda expressions XML Literals Type Inference Extension methods  2010  In April 2010, Microsoft released Visual Basic 2010. Microsoft had planned to use Dynamic Language Runtime for that release but shifted to a co evolution strategy between Visual Basic and sister language C to bring both languages into closer parity with one another. Visual Basic's innate ability to interact dynamically with CLR and COM objects has been enhanced to work with dynamic languages built on the DLR such as IronPython and IronRuby. The Visual Basic compiler was improved to infer line continuation in a set of common contexts, in many cases removing the need for the  line continuation characters. Also, existing support of inline Functions was complemented with support for inline Subs as well as multi line versions of both Sub and Function lambdas.  2012  Visual Basic 2012 was released alongside .NET Framework 4.5. Major features introduced in this version include: Asynchronous programming with async and await statements Iterators Call hierarchy Caller information Global keyword in namespace statements  2013  Visual Basic 2013 was released alongside .NET Framework 4.5.1 with Visual Studio 2013. Can also build .NET Framework 4.5.2 applications by installing Developer Pack.  2015  Visual Basic 2015 was released with Visual Studio 2015. Language features include a new ?. operator to perform inline null checks, and a new string interpolation feature is included to format strings inline.  2017  Visual Basic 2017 was released with Visual Studio 2017. Extends support for new Visual Basic 15 language features with revision 2017, 15.3, 15.5, 15.8. Introduces new refactorings that allow organizing source code with one action.  2019  Visual Basic 2019 was released with Visual Studio 2019. It is the first version of Visual Basic focused on .NET Core.  Cross platform and open source development The official Visual Basic compiler is written in Visual Basic and is available on GitHub as a part of the .NET Compiler Platform. The creation of open source tools for Visual Basic development has been slow compared to C , although the Mono development platform provides an implementation of Visual Basic specific libraries and a Visual Basic 2005 compatible compiler written in Visual Basic, as well as standard framework libraries such as Windows Forms GUI library. MonoDevelop is an open source alternative IDE. The Gambas environment is also similar but distinct from Visual Basic.

            "text": "JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98 of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high level, often just in time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype based object orientation, and first class functions. It is multi paradigm, supporting event driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model . The ECMAScript standard does not include any input output , such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I O. JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.  History   Creation at Netscape  The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most used.During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.  Adoption by Microsoft  Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of best viewed in Netscape and best viewed in Internet Explorer logos for several years.  The rise of JScript  In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997. The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95 . This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client side scripting on the Web. Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.  Growth and standardization  During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia , who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition. Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools. Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The key innovation was just in time compilation , so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.  Reaching maturity  Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I O APIs, thereby providing a stand alone JavaScript runtime system. As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers, and npm had the most modules of any package manager in the world.The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single page applications and other JavaScript heavy websites, several transpilers have been created to aid the development process.  Trademark  JavaScript is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2010.  Website client side usage JavaScript is the dominant client side scripting language of the Web, with 98 of all websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.  Examples of scripted behavior  Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page. Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them. Playing browser games. Controlling the playback of streaming media. Generating pop up ads or alert boxes. Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server. Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization. Redirecting a user to another page. Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.  Libraries and frameworks  Over 80 of websites use a third party JavaScript library or web framework for their client side scripting.jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75 of websites. Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.In contrast, the term Vanilla JS has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.  Other usage The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server side website deployments and non browser applications. Initial attempts at promoting server side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.JavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.  Features The following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise.  Imperative and structured  JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C . One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons to be omitted.  Weakly typed  JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used. The binary operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator The binary operator always casts both operands to a number Both unary operators always cast the operand to a numberValues are cast to strings like the following: Strings are left as is Numbers are converted to their string representation Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas Other objects are converted to the string object Object where Object is the name of the constructor of the objectValues are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively. JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction. Often also mentioned is   resulting in 0 . This is misleading: the is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary operator. If you wrap the expression in parentheses the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is object Object as expected.  Dynamic  Typing JavaScript is dynamically typed like most other scripting languages. A type is associated with a value rather than an expression. For example, a variable initially bound to a number may be reassigned to a string. JavaScript supports various ways to test the type of objects, including duck typing. Run time evaluation JavaScript includes an eval function that can execute statements provided as strings at run time.  Object orientation  Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as: You make prototype objects, and then ... make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects... Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that? In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype ; each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation and bracket notation . A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run time. Most properties of an object can be enumerated using a for...in loop. Prototypes JavaScript uses prototypes where many other object oriented languages use classes for inheritance. It is possible to simulate many class based features with prototypes in JavaScript. Functions as object constructors Functions double as object constructors, along with their typical role. Prefixing a function call with new will create an instance of a prototype, inheriting properties and methods from the constructor . ECMAScript 5 offers the Object.create method, allowing explicit creation of an instance without automatically inheriting from the Object prototype . The constructor's prototype property determines the object used for the new object's internal prototype. New methods can be added by modifying the prototype of the function used as a constructor. JavaScript's built in constructors, such as Array or Object, also have prototypes that can be modified. While it is possible to modify the Object prototype, it is generally considered bad practice because most objects in JavaScript will inherit methods and properties from the Object prototype, and they may not expect the prototype to be modified. Functions as methods Unlike many object oriented languages, there is no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling: when a function is called as a method of an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to that object for that invocation.  Functional  JavaScript functions are first class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as .call and .bind . A nested function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: the lexical scope of the outer function becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes. JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.  Delegative  JavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation. Functions as roles JavaScript natively supports various function based implementations of Role patterns like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this keyword within its function body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call or apply to objects that need to feature additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain. Object composition and inheritance Whereas explicit function based delegation does cover composition in JavaScript, implicit delegation already happens every time the prototype chain is walked in order to, e.g., find a method that might be related to but is not directly owned by an object. Once the method is found it gets called within this object's context. Thus inheritance in JavaScript is covered by a delegation automatism that is bound to the prototype property of constructor functions.  Miscellaneous  JavaScript is a zero index language. Run time environment JavaScript typically relies on a run time environment to provide objects and methods by which scripts can interact with the environment . These environments are single threaded. JavaScript also relies on the run time environment to provide the ability to include import scripts . This is not a language feature per se, but it is common in most JavaScript implementations. JavaScript processes messages from a queue one at a time. JavaScript calls a function associated with each new message, creating a call stack frame with the function's arguments and local variables. The call stack shrinks and grows based on the function's needs. When the call stack is empty upon function completion, JavaScript proceeds to the next message in the queue. This is called the event loop, described as run to completion because each message is fully processed before the next message is considered. However, the language's concurrency model describes the event loop as non blocking: program input output is performed using events and callback functions. This means, for instance, that JavaScript can process a mouse click while waiting for a database query to return information.Variadic functions An indefinite number of parameters can be passed to a function. The function can access them through formal parameters and also through the local arguments object. Variadic functions can also be created by using the bind method.Array and object literals Like many scripting languages, arrays and objects can each be created with a succinct shortcut syntax. In fact, these literals form the basis of the JSON data format.Regular expressions JavaScript also supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provide a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built in string functions.Promises and Async await JavaScript supports promises and Async await for handling asynchronous operations. A built in Promise object provides functionality for handling promises and associating handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual result. Recently, combinator methods were introduced in the JavaScript specification, which allows developers to combine multiple JavaScript promises and do operations based on different scenarios. The methods introduced are: Promise.race, Promise.all, Promise.allSettled and Promise.any. Async await allows an asynchronous, non blocking function to be structured in a way similar to an ordinary synchronous function. Asynchronous, non blocking code can be written, with minimal overhead, structured similar to traditional synchronous, blocking code.  Vendor specific extensions  Historically, some JavaScript engines supported these non standard features: conditional catch clauses array comprehensions and generator expressions concise function expressions expr; this experimental syntax predated arrow functions ECMAScript for XML , an extension that adds native XML support to ECMAScript  Syntax   Simple examples  Variables in JavaScript can be defined using either the var, let or const keywords. Variables defined without keywords will be defined at the global scope. Note the comments in the example above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes. There is no built in Input output functionality in JavaScript, instead it is provided by the run time environment. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions that there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results . However, most runtime environments have a console object that can be used to print output. Here is a minimalist Hello World program in JavaScript in a runtime environment with a console object: In HTML documents, a program like this is required for an output: A simple recursive function to calculate the factorial of a natural number: An anonymous function : This example shows that, in JavaScript, function closures capture their non local variables by reference. Arrow functions were first introduced in 6th Edition ECMAScript 2015. They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous, so a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation, unless surrounded by parenthesis and executed immediately. Example of arrow function: In JavaScript, objects are usually created by creating an instance of a class. Older versions of JavaScript instead utilized a function object. Object example: Variadic function demonstration : Immediately invoked function expressions are often used to create closures. Closures allow gathering properties and methods in a namespace and making some of them private: Generator objects provide a function which can called, exited, and re entered while maintaining internal context . JavaScript can export and import from modules:Export example: Import example:  More advanced example  This sample code displays various JavaScript features. The following output should be displayed in the browser window.  Security  JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web related actions, not general purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox. There are subsets of general JavaScript ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties . Closure Toolkit is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third party JavaScript and HTML.Content Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.  Cross site vulnerabilities  A common JavaScript related security problem is cross site scripting , a violation of the same origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use HTML escaping whenever displaying untrusted data. Some browsers include partial protection against reflected XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server side can fully prevent XSS. XSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.Another cross site vulnerability is cross site request forgery . In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site . When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help. JavaScript hijacking is a type of CSRF attack in which a script tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include: requiring an authentication token in the POST and GET parameters for any response that returns private information.  Misplaced trust in the client  Developers of client server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are: Web site authors cannot perfectly conceal how their JavaScript operates because the raw source code must be sent to the client. The code can be obfuscated, but obfuscation can be reverse engineered. JavaScript form validation only provides convenience for users, not security. If a site verifies that the user agreed to its terms of service, or filters invalid characters out of fields that should only contain numbers, it must do so on the server, not only the client. Scripts can be selectively disabled, so JavaScript cannot be relied on to prevent operations such as right clicking on an image to save it. It is considered very bad practice to embed sensitive information such as passwords in JavaScript because it can be extracted by an attacker.  Misplaced trust in developers  Package management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developers' program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133,000 websites, researchers found 37 of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago. Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Ko ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.  Browser and plugin coding errors  JavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges. These flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.Plugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript .In Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges. Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own sandbox .  Sandbox implementation errors  Web browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web. Incorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer.Microsoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general purpose, non sandboxed programs . This makes JavaScript a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.  Hardware vulnerabilities  In 2015, a JavaScript based proof of concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.In 2017, a JavaScript based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It's called ASLR Cache or AnC.In 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.  Development tools Important tools have evolved with the language. Every major web browser has built in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger. Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines. Some browsers have built in profilers. Stand alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench. Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.  Related technologies   Java  A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java. Both indeed have a C like syntax . They are also typically sandboxed , and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.Java and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications. The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human readable source code. Java's objects are class based, while JavaScript's are prototype based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.  JSON  JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.  TypeScript  TypeScript is a strictly typed variant of JavaScript. TS differs by introducing type annotations to variables and functions, and introducing a type language to describe the types within JS. Otherwise TS shares much the same featureset as JS, to allow it to be easily transpiled to JS for running client side, and to interoperate with other JS code.  WebAssembly  Since 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed. WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code. asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.  Transpilers  JavaScript is the dominant client side language of the Web, and many websites are script heavy.

            "text": "A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as fossil conulariids. Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate in minute crystalline form, which has deposited in concentric layers. The ideal pearl is perfectly round and smooth, but many other shapes, known as baroque pearls, can occur. The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. Because of this, pearl has become a metaphor for something rare, fine, admirable and valuable. The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare. These wild pearls are referred to as natural pearls. Cultured or farmed pearls from pearl oysters and freshwater mussels make up the majority of those currently sold. Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry. Pearls have been harvested and cultivated primarily for use in jewelry, but in the past were also used to adorn clothing. They have also been crushed and used in cosmetics, medicines and paint formulations. Whether wild or cultured, gem quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them. However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls of lesser shine or less spherical shape. Although these may also be legitimately referred to as pearls by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, most of them have no value except as curiosities.  Etymology The English word pearl comes from the French perle, originally from the Latin perna meaning leg, after the ham or mutton leg shaped bivalve.The scientific name for the family of pearl bearing oysters, Margaritiferidae comes from the Old Persian word for pearl marg r ta which is the source of the English name Margaret.  Definition  All shelled mollusks can, by natural processes, produce some kind of pearl when an irritating microscopic object becomes trapped within its mantle folds, but the great majority of these pearls are not valued as gemstones. Nacreous pearls, the best known and most commercially significant, are primarily produced by two groups of molluskan bivalves or clams. A nacreous pearl is made from layers of nacre, by the same living process as is used in the secretion of the mother of pearl which lines the shell. Natural pearls, formed without human intervention, are very rare. Many hundreds of pearl oysters or mussels must be gathered and opened, and thus killed, to find even one wild pearl; for many centuries, this was the only way pearls were obtained, and why pearls fetched such extraordinary prices in the past. Cultured pearls are formed in pearl farms, using human intervention as well as natural processes. One family of nacreous pearl bivalves the pearl oyster lives in the sea, while the other a very different group of bivalves lives in freshwater; these are the river mussels such as the freshwater pearl mussel. Saltwater pearls can grow in several species of marine pearl oysters in the family Pteriidae. Freshwater pearls grow within certain species of freshwater mussels in the order Unionida, the families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae.  Physical properties  The unique luster of pearls depends upon the reflection, refraction, and diffraction of light from the translucent layers. The thinner and more numerous the layers in the pearl, the finer the luster. The iridescence that pearls display is caused by the overlapping of successive layers, which breaks up light falling on the surface. In addition, pearls can be dyed yellow, green, blue, brown, pink, purple, or black. The most valuable pearls have a metallic, highly reflective luster. Because pearls are made primarily of calcium carbonate, they can be dissolved in vinegar. Calcium carbonate is susceptible to even a weak acid solution because the crystals react with the acetic acid in the vinegar to form calcium acetate and carbon dioxide.  Freshwater and saltwater pearls Freshwater and saltwater pearls may sometimes look quite similar, but they come from different sources. Freshwater pearls form in various species of freshwater mussels, family Unionidae, which live in lakes, rivers, ponds and other bodies of fresh water. These freshwater pearl mussels occur not only in hotter climates, but also in colder more temperate areas such as Scotland . Most freshwater cultured pearls sold today come from China. Saltwater pearls grow within pearl oysters, family Pteriidae, which live in oceans. Saltwater pearl oysters are usually cultivated in protected lagoons or volcanic atolls.  Creation  The mollusk's mantle deposits layers of calcium carbonate in the form of the mineral aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite held together by an organic horn like compound called conchiolin. The combination of aragonite and conchiolin is called nacre, which makes up mother of pearl. The commonly held belief that a grain of sand acts as the irritant is in fact rarely the case. Typical stimuli include organic material, parasites, or even damage that displaces mantle tissue to another part of the mollusk's body. These small particles or organisms gain entry when the shell valves are open for feeding or respiration. In cultured pearls, the irritant is typically an introduced piece of the mantle epithelium, with or without a spherical bead .  Natural pearls  Natural pearls are nearly 100 calcium carbonate and conchiolin. It is thought that natural pearls form under a set of accidental conditions when a microscopic intruder or parasite enters a bivalve mollusk and settles inside the shell. The mollusk, irritated by the intruder, forms a pearl sac of external mantle tissue cells and secretes the calcium carbonate and conchiolin to cover the irritant. This secretion process is repeated many times, thus producing a pearl. Natural pearls come in many shapes, with perfectly round ones being comparatively rare. Typically, the build up of a natural pearl consists of a brown central zone formed by columnar calcium carbonate and a yellowish to white outer zone consisting of nacre . In a pearl cross section such as the diagram, these two different materials can be seen. The presence of columnar calcium carbonate rich in organic material indicates juvenile mantle tissue that formed during the early stage of pearl development. Displaced living cells with a well defined task may continue to perform their function in their new location, often resulting in a cyst. Such displacement may occur via an injury. The fragile rim of the shell is exposed and is prone to damage and injury. Crabs, other predators and parasites such as worm larvae may produce traumatic attacks and cause injuries in which some external mantle tissue cells are disconnected from their layer. Embedded in the conjunctive tissue of the mantle, these cells may survive and form a small pocket in which they continue to secrete calcium carbonate, their natural product. The pocket is called a pearl sac, and grows with time by cell division. The juvenile mantle tissue cells, according to their stage of growth, secrete columnar calcium carbonate from pearl sac's inner surface. In time, the pearl sac's external mantle cells proceed to the formation of tabular aragonite. When the transition to nacre secretion occurs, the brown pebble becomes covered with a nacreous coating. During this process, the pearl sac seems to travel into the shell; however, the sac actually stays in its original relative position the mantle tissue while the shell itself grows. After a couple of years, a pearl forms and the shell may be found by a lucky pearl fisher.  Cultured pearls  Cultured pearls are the response of the shell to a tissue implant. A tiny piece of mantle tissue from a donor shell is transplanted into a recipient shell, causing a pearl sac to form into which the tissue precipitates calcium carbonate. There are a number of methods for producing cultured pearls: using freshwater or seawater shells, transplanting the graft into the mantle or into the gonad, and adding a spherical bead as a nucleus. Most saltwater cultured pearls are grown with beads. Trade names of cultured pearls are Akoya , white or golden South sea, and black Tahitian. Most beadless cultured pearls are mantle grown in freshwater shells in China, and are known as freshwater cultured pearls. Cultured pearls can be distinguished from natural pearls by X ray examination. Nucleated cultured pearls are often 'preformed' as they tend to follow the shape of the implanted shell bead nucleus. After a bead is inserted into the oyster, it secretes a few layers of nacre around the bead; the resulting cultured pearl can then be harvested in as few as twelve to eighteen months. When a cultured pearl with a bead nucleus is X rayed, it reveals a different structure to that of a natural pearl . A beaded cultured pearl shows a solid center with no concentric growth rings, whereas a natural pearl shows a series of concentric growth rings. A beadless cultured pearl may show growth rings, but also a complex central cavity, witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac.  Imitation pearls  Some imitation pearls are simply made of mother of pearl, coral or conch shell, while others are made from glass and are coated with a solution containing fish scales called essence d'Orient.  Gemological identification  A well equipped gem testing laboratory can distinguish natural pearls from cultured pearls by using gemological X ray equipment to examine the center of a pearl. With X rays it is possible to see the growth rings of the pearl, where the layers of calcium carbonate are separated by thin layers of conchiolin. The differentiation of natural pearls from non beaded cultured pearls can be very difficult without the use of this X ray technique. Natural and cultured pearls can be distinguished from imitation pearls using a microscope. Another method of testing for imitations is to rub two pearls against each other. Imitation pearls are completely smooth, but natural and cultured pearls are composed of nacre platelets, making both feel slightly gritty.  Value of a natural pearl  Fine quality natural pearls are very rare jewels. Their values are determined similarly to those of other precious gems, according to size, shape, color, quality of surface, orient and luster. Single natural pearls are often sold as collectors' items, or set as centerpieces in unique jewelry. Very few matched strands of natural pearls exist, and those that do often sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The introduction and advance of the cultured pearl hit the pearl industry hard. Pearl dealers publicly disputed the authenticity of these new cultured products, and left many consumers uneasy and confused about their much lower prices. Essentially, the controversy damaged the images of both natural and cultured pearls. By the 1950s, when a significant number of women in developed countries could afford their own cultured pearl necklace, natural pearls were reduced to a small, exclusive niche in the pearl industry.  Origin of a natural pearl  Previously, natural pearls were found in many parts of the world. Present day natural pearling is confined mostly to seas off Bahrain. Australia also has one of the world's last remaining fleets of pearl diving ships. Australian pearl divers dive for south sea pearl oysters to be used in the cultured south sea pearl industry. The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the natural pearl days. Hence significant numbers of natural pearls are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters. X ray examination is required to positively verify natural pearls found today.  Types of cultured pearls  A keshi pearl is a pearl composed entirely of nacre and results from mishaps in the culturing process. Most are quite small, typically only a few millimeters in diameter, and are often irregular in shape. In seeding a cultured pearl, a piece of mantle muscle from a sacrificed oyster is placed with a bead of mother of pearl within a host oyster. If the piece of mantle should slip off the bead, a keshi pearl forms of baroque shape about the mantle piece. Therefore, while a keshi pearl could be considered superior to cultured pearls with a mother of pearl bead center, in the cultured pearl industry the oyster's resources used to create a mistaken all nacre baroque pearl is a drain on the production of the intended round cultured pearl. Therefore, the pearl industry is making ongoing attempts to improve culturing technique so that keshi pearls do not occur. All nacre pearls may one day be limited to natural found pearls. Today many keshi pearls are actually intentional, with post harvest shells returned to the water to regenerate a pearl in the existing pearl sac. Tahitian pearls, frequently referred to as black pearls, are highly valued because of their rarity; the culturing process for them dictates a smaller volume output and they can never be mass produced because, in common with most sea pearls, the oyster can only be nucleated with one pearl at a time, while freshwater mussels are capable of multiple pearl implants. Before the days of cultured pearls, black pearls were rare and highly valued for the simple reason that white pearl oysters rarely produced naturally black pearls, and black pearl oysters rarely produced any natural pearls at all. Since the development of pearl culture technology, the black pearl oysters Pinctada margaritifera found in Tahiti and many other Pacific islands including the Cook Islands and Fiji are being extensively used for producing cultured pearls. The rarity of the black cultured pearl is now a comparative issue. The black cultured pearl is rare when compared to Chinese freshwater cultured pearls, and Japanese and Chinese akoya cultured pearls, and is more valuable than these pearls. However, it is more abundant than the South Sea pearl, which is more valuable than the black cultured pearl. This is simply because the black pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is far more abundant than the elusive, rare, and larger south sea pearl oyster Pinctada maxima, which cannot be found in lagoons, but which must be dived for in a rare number of deep ocean habitats or grown in hatcheries. Natural black pearls are rare, with black pearls having a body color that may be assessed as silver, silver blue, gold, brown black, green black, or black.Black cultured pearls from the black pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera are not South Sea pearls, although they are often mistakenly described as black South Sea pearls. In the absence of an official definition for the pearl from the black all use to, these pearls are usually referred to as black pearls .The correct definition of a South Sea pearl as described by CIBJO and GIA is a pearl produced by the Pinctada maxima pearl oyster. South Sea pearls are the color of their host Pinctada maxima oyster and can be white, silver, pink, gold, cream, and any combination of these basic colors, including overtones of the various colors of the rainbow displayed in the pearl nacre of the oyster shell itself. South Sea pearls are the largest and rarest of the cultured pearls making them the most valuable. Prized for their exquisitely beautiful 'orient' or lustre, South Sea pearls are now farmed in various parts of the world where the Pinctada maxima oysters can be found, with the finest South Sea pearls being produced by Paspaley along the remote coastline of North Western Australia. White and silver colored South Sea pearls tend to come from the Broome area of Australia, while golden colored ones are more prevalent in the Philippines and Indonesia. A farm in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is culturing pearls from the black lipped Pinctada mazatlanica oysters and the rainbow lipped Pteria sterna oysters. Also called Concha N car, the pearls from these rainbow lipped oysters fluoresce red under ultraviolet light.  From other species  Biologically speaking, under the right set of circumstances, almost any shelled mollusk can produce some kind of pearl. However, most of these molluskan pearls have no luster or iridescence. The great majority of mollusk species produce pearls which are not attractive, and are sometimes not even very durable. Such pearls usually have no value at all, except perhaps to a scientist or collector, or as a curiosity. These objects used to be referred to as calcareous concretions by some gemologists, even though a malacologist would still consider them to be pearls. Valueless pearls of this type are sometimes found in edible mussels, edible oysters, escargot snails, and so on. The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term 'pearl' when referring to such items and, under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusk pearls may be referred to as 'pearls', without qualification.A few species produce pearls that can be of interest as gemstones. These species include the bailer shell Melo, the giant clam Tridacna, various scallop species, Pen shells Pinna, and the Haliotis iris species of abalone. Pearls of abalone, or paua, are mabe pearls, or blister pearls, unique to New Zealand waters and are commonly referred to as 'blue pearls'. They are admired for their incredible luster and naturally bright vibrant colors that are often compared to opal. Another example is the conch pearl , which is found very rarely growing between the mantle and the shell of the queen conch or pink conch, Strombus gigas, a large sea snail or marine gastropod from the Caribbean Sea. These pearls, which are often pink in color, are a by product of the conch fishing industry, and the best of them display a shimmering optical effect related to chatoyance known as 'flame structure'. Somewhat similar gastropod pearls, this time more orange in hue, are found in the horse conch Triplofusus papillosus. The second largest pearl known was found in the Philippines in 1934 and is known as the Pearl of Lao Tzu. It is a naturally occurring, non nacreous, calcareous concretion from a giant clam. Because it did not grow in a pearl oyster it is not pearly; instead the surface is glossy like porcelain. Other pearls from giant clams are known to exist, but this is a particularly large one weighing 14 lb . The largest known pearl is the Pearl of Puerto, also found in the Philippines by a fisherman from Puerto Princesa, Palawan Island. The enormous pearl is 30 cm wide , 67 cm long and weighs 75 lb .  History   Pearl hunting  The ancient chronicle Mahavamsa mentions the thriving pearl industry in the port of Oruwella in the Gulf of Mannar in Sri Lanka. It also records that eight varieties of pearls accompanied Prince Vijaya's embassy to the Pandyan king as well as king Devanampiya Tissa's embassy to Emperor Ashoka. Pliny the Elder praised the pearl fishery of the Gulf as most productive in the world.For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar. Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions. Starting in the Han Dynasty , the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea. Tanka pearl divers of twelfth century China attached ropes to their waists in order to be safely brought back up to the surface. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Western Hemisphere, they discovered that around the islands of Cubagua and Margarita, some 200 km north of the Venezuelan coast, was an extensive pearl bed . One discovered and named pearl, La Peregrina pearl, was offered to Philip II of Spain who intended to give it as a gift for his daughter on the occasion of her marriage, but the King found it so beautiful that he kept it for himself. Later, he elevated it to be part of the Spanish Crown Jewel. and from then on the pearl is recorded in every royal inventory for more than 200 years. According to Garcilasso de la Vega, who says that he saw La Peregrina at Seville in 1607, this was found at Panama in 1560 by a slave worker who was rewarded with his liberty, and his owner with the office of alcalde of Panama. Margarita pearls are extremely difficult to find today and are known for their unique yellowish color. Before the beginning of the 20th century, pearl hunting was the most common way of harvesting pearls. Divers manually pulled oysters from ocean floors and river bottoms and checked them individually for pearls. Not all mussels and oysters produce pearls. In a haul of three tons, only three or four oysters will produce perfect pearls.  British Isles  Pearls were one of the attractions which drew Julius Caesar to Britain. They are, for the most part, freshwater pearls from mussels. Pearling was banned in the U.K. in 1998 due to the endangered status of river mussels. Discovery and publicity about the sale for a substantial sum of the Abernethy pearl in the River Tay had resulted in heavy exploitation of mussel colonies during the 1970s and 80s by weekend warriors. When it was permitted it was carried on mainly by Scottish Travellers who found pearls varied from river to river with the River Oykel in the Highlands being noted for the finest rose pink pearls. There are two firms in Scotland that are licensed to sell pre 1998 freshwater pearls.  Pearl farming  Today, the cultured pearls on the market can be divided into two categories. The first category covers the beaded cultured pearls, including akoya, South Sea and Tahiti. These pearls are gonad grown, and usually one pearl is grown at a time. This limits the number of pearls at a harvest period. The pearls are usually harvested after one year for akoya, 2 4 years for Tahitian and South Sea, and 2 7 years for freshwater. This perliculture process was first developed by the British biologist William Saville Kent who passed the information along to Tatsuhei Mise and Tokichi Nishikawa from Japan. The second category includes the non beaded freshwater cultured pearls, like the Biwa or Chinese pearls. As they grow in the mantle, where on each wing up to 25 grafts can be implanted, these pearls are much more frequent and saturate the market completely. An impressive improvement in quality has taken place over ten years when the former rice grain shaped pebbles are compared with the near round pearls of today. Later, large near perfect round bead nucleated pearls up to 15mm in diameter have been produced with metallic luster. The nucleus bead in a beaded cultured pearl is generally a polished sphere made from freshwater mussel shell. Along with a small piece of mantle tissue from another mollusk to serve as a catalyst for the pearl sac, it is surgically implanted into the gonad of a saltwater mollusk. In freshwater perliculture, only the piece of tissue is used in most cases, and is inserted into the fleshy mantle of the host mussel. South Sea and Tahitian pearl oysters, also known as Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera, which survive the subsequent surgery to remove the finished pearl, are often implanted with a new, larger beads as part of the same procedure and then returned to the water for another 2 3 years of growth. Despite the common misperception, Mikimoto did not discover the process of pearl culture. The accepted process of pearl culture was developed by the British Biologist William Saville Kent in Australia and brought to Japan by Tokichi Nishikawa and Tatsuhei Mise. Nishikawa was granted the patent in 1916, and married the daughter of Mikimoto. Mikimoto was able to use Nishikawa's technology. After the patent was granted in 1916, the technology was immediately commercially applied to akoya pearl oysters in Japan in 1916. Mise's brother was the first to produce a commercial crop of pearls in the akoya oyster. Mitsubishi's Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the south sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton, and Palau. Mitsubishi was the first to produce a cultured south sea pearl although it was not until 1928 that the first small commercial crop of pearls was successfully produced. The original Japanese cultured pearls, known as akoya pearls, are produced by a species of small pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata martensii, which is no bigger than 6 to 8 cm in size, hence akoya pearls larger than 10 mm in diameter are extremely rare and highly priced. Today, a hybrid mollusk is used in both Japan and China in the production of akoya pearls. Cultured Pearls were sold in cans for the export market. These were packed in Japan by the I.C.P. Canning Factory in Nagasaki Pref. Japan.  Timeline of pearl production Mitsubishi commenced pearl culture with the South Sea pearl oyster in 1916, as soon as the technology patent was commercialized. By 1931 this project was showing signs of success, but was upset by the death of Tatsuhei Mise. Although the project was recommenced after Tatsuhei's death, the project was discontinued at the beginning of WWII before significant productions of pearls were achieved. After WWII, new south sea pearl projects were commenced in the early 1950s at Kuri Bay and Port Essington in Australia, and Burma. Japanese companies were involved in all projects using technicians from the original Mitsubishi South Sea pre war projects. Kuri Bay is now the location of one of the largest and most well known pearl farms owned by Paspaley, the biggest producer of South Sea pearls in the world.In 2010, China overtook Japan in akoya pearl production. Japan has all but ceased its production of akoya pearls smaller than 8 mm. Japan maintains its status as a pearl processing center, however, and imports the majority of Chinese akoya pearl production. These pearls are then processed , relabeled as product of Japan, and exported.In the past two decades, cultured pearls have been produced using larger oysters in the south Pacific and Indian Ocean. The largest pearl oyster is the Pinctada maxima, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. South Sea pearls are characterized by their large size and warm luster. Sizes up to 14 mm in diameter are not uncommon. In 2013, Indonesia Pearl supplied 43 percent of South Sea Pearls international market. The other significant producers are Australia, Philippines, Myanmar and Malaysia.  Freshwater pearl farming In 1914, pearl farmers began growing cultured freshwater pearls using the pearl mussels native to Lake Biwa. This lake, the largest and most ancient in Japan, lies near the city of Kyoto. The extensive and successful use of the Biwa Pearl Mussel is reflected in the name Biwa pearls, a phrase which was at one time nearly synonymous with freshwater pearls in general. Since the time of peak production in 1971, when Biwa pearl farmers produced six tons of cultured pearls, pollution has caused the virtual extinction of the industry. Japanese pearl farmers recently cultured a hybrid pearl mussel a cross between Biwa Pearl Mussels and a closely related species from China, Hyriopsis cumingi, in Lake Kasumigaura. This industry has also nearly ceased production, due to pollution. Currently, the Belpearl company based out of Kobe, Japan continues to purchase the remaining Kasumiga ura pearls. Japanese pearl producers also invested in producing cultured pearls with freshwater mussels in the region of Shanghai, China. China has since become the world's largest producer of freshwater pearls, producing more than 1,500 metric tons per year . Led by pearl pioneer John Latendresse and his wife Chessy, the United States began farming cultured freshwater pearls in the mid 1960s. National Geographic magazine introduced the American cultured pearl as a commercial product in their August 1985 issue. The Tennessee pearl farm has emerged as a tourist destination in recent years, but commercial production of freshwater pearls has ceased.  Momme weight For many cultured pearl dealers and wholesalers, the preferred weight measure used for loose pearls and pearl strands is the momme. Momme is a weight measure used by the Japanese for centuries. Today, momme weight is still the standard unit of measure used by most pearl dealers to communicate with pearl producers and wholesalers. One momme corresponds to 1 1000 kan. Reluctant to give up tradition, the Japanese government formalized the kan measure in 1891 as being exactly 3.75 kilograms or 8.28 pounds. Hence, 1 momme 3.75 grams or 3750 milligrams. In the United States, during the 19th and 20th centuries, through trade with Japan in silk cloth the momme became a unit indicating the quality of silk cloth. Though millimeter size range is typically the first factor in determining a cultured pearl necklace's value, the momme weight of pearl necklace will allow the buyer to quickly determine if the necklace is properly proportioned. This is especially true when comparing the larger south sea and Tahitian pearl necklaces.  In jewelry The value of the pearls in jewelry is determined by a combination of the luster, color, size, lack of surface flaw and symmetry that are appropriate for the type of pearl under consideration. Among those attributes, luster is the most important differentiator of pearl quality according to jewelers. All factors being equal, however, the larger the pearl the more valuable it is. Large, perfectly round pearls are rare and highly valued. Teardrop shaped pearls are often used in pendants.  Gallery        Shapes  Pearls are generally of spherical shapes. Perfectly round pearls are the rarest and most valuable shape. Semi rounds are also used in necklaces or in pieces where the shape of the pearl can be disguised to look like it is a perfectly round pearl. Button pearls are like a slightly flattened round pearl and can also make a necklace, but are more often used in single pendants or earrings where the back half of the pearl is covered, making it look like a larger, rounder pearl. Pear shaped pearls sometimes look like teardrop pearls and are most often seen in earrings, pendants, or as a center pearl in a necklace. Baroque pearls have a different appeal; they are often highly irregular with unique and interesting shapes. They are also commonly seen in necklaces. Circled pearls are characterized by concentric ridges, or rings, around the body of the pearl. In general, cultured pearls are less valuable than natural pearls, whereas imitation pearls have almost no value. One way that jewelers can determine whether a pearl is cultured or natural is to have a gemlab perform an X ray examination of the pearl. If X rays reveals a nucleus, the pearl is likely a bead nucleated saltwater pearl. If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the pearl is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater pearls can often be confused for natural pearls which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the pearl. Natural pearls will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.  Lengths of pearl necklaces  There is a special vocabulary used to describe the length of pearl necklaces. While most other necklaces are simply referred to by their physical measurement, pearl necklaces are named by how low they hang when worn around the neck. A collar, measuring 10 to 13 inches or 25 to 33 cm in length, sits directly against the throat and does not hang down the neck at all; collars are often made up of multiple strands of pearls. Pearl chokers, measuring 14 to 16 inches or 35 to 41 cm in length, nestle just at the base of the neck. A strand called a princess length, measuring 17 to 19 inches or 43 to 48 cm in length, comes down to or just below the collarbone. A matinee length, measuring 20 to 24 inches or 50 to 60 cm in length, falls just above the breasts. An opera length, measuring 28 to 35 inches or 70 to 90 cm in length, will be long enough to reach the breastbone or sternum of the wearer; and longer still, a pearl rope, measuring more than 45 inches or 115 cm in length, is any length that falls down farther than an opera. Necklaces can also be classified as uniform, or graduated. In a uniform strand of pearls, all pearls are classified as the same size, but actually fall in a range. A uniform strand of akoya pearls, for example, will measure within 0.5 mm. So a strand will never be 7 mm, but will be 6.5 7 mm. Freshwater pearls, Tahitian pearls, and South Sea pearls all measure to a full millimeter when considered uniform. A graduated strand of pearls most often has at least 3 mm of differentiation from the ends to the center of the necklace. Popularized in the United States during the 1950s by the GIs bringing strands of cultured akoya pearls home from Japan, a 3.5 momme, 3 mm to 7 mm graduated strand was much more affordable than a uniform strand because most of the pearls were small.  Colors  Earrings and necklaces can also be classified on the grade of the color of the pearl: saltwater and freshwater pearls come in many different colors. While white, and more recently black, saltwater pearls are by far the most popular, other color tints can be found on pearls from the oceans. Pink, blue, champagne, green, and even purple saltwater pearls can be encountered, but to collect enough of these rare colors to form a complete string of the same size and same shade can take years. The vast majority of inexpensive colored pearls have been subjected to some form of dye, often a fabric dye. This dye will only tend to penetrate the first layer or two of nacre, but this is enough to impart vivid and sometimes garish color to otherwise white pearls. Truly valuable pearls are never dyed, and this process is not believed to add and in most cases would only subtract from their market value.  Religious references   Hindu scriptures  The Hindu tradition describes the sacred Nine Pearls which were first documented in the Garuda Purana, one of the books of the Hindu scriptures. Ayurveda contains references to pearl powder as a stimulant of digestion and to treat mental ailments. According to Marco Polo, the kings of Malabar wore a necklace of 108 rubies and pearls which was given from one generation of kings to the next. The reason was that every king had to say 108 prayers every morning and every evening. At least until the beginning of the 20th century it was a Hindu custom to present a completely new, undrilled pearl and pierce it during the wedding ceremony.The Pearl, which can be transliterated to Moti , a type of Mani from Sanskrit, is also associated with many Hindu deities, the most famous being the Kaustubha that Lord Vishnu wears on his chest.  Hebrew scriptures  The Hebrew word   'pearl ' appears in several places in the Hebrew Bible , although its etymology is unclear.  New Testament scriptures  In a Christian New Testament parable , Jesus compared the Kingdom of Heaven to a pearl of great price . Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are reportedly each made of a single pearl in Revelation 21:21, that is, the Pearly Gates. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. Holy things are compared to pearls in Matthew 7:6: Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. Pearls are also found in numerous references showing the wickedness and pride of a people, as in Revelation 18:16. And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, in purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  Islamic scriptures  The Quran often mentions that dwellers of paradise will be adorned with pearls: 22:23 God will admit those who believe and work righteous deeds, to Gardens beneath which rivers flow: they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. 35:33 Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold, silver and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk. 52:24 Round about them will serve, devoted to them, youths handsome as pearls well guarded.  Additional references  The metaphor of a pearl appears in the longer Hymn of the Pearl, a poem respected for its high literary quality, and use of layered theological metaphor, found within one of the texts of Gnosticism. The Pearl of Great Price is a book of scripture in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and some other Latter Day Saint denominations. Pearl is a Middle English religious poem.

            "text": "SIMSCRIPT is a free form, English like general purpose simulation language conceived by Harry Markowitz and Bernard Hausner at the RAND Corporation in 1962. It was implemented as a Fortran preprocessor on the IBM 7090 and was designed for large discrete event simulations. It influenced Simula.Though earlier versions were released into the public domain, SIMSCRIPT was commercialized by Markowitz's company, California Analysis Center, Inc. , which produced proprietary versions SIMSCRIPT I.5 and SIMSCRIPT II.5.  SIMSCRIPT II.5 SIMSCRIPT II.5 was the last pre PC incarnation of SIMSCRIPT, one of the oldest computer simulation languages. Although military contractor CACI released it in 1971, it still enjoys wide use in large scale military and air traffic control simulations. SIMSCRIPT II.5 is a powerful, free form, English like, general purpose simulation programming language. It supports the application of software engineering principles, such as structured programming and modularity, which impart orderliness and manageability to simulation models.  SIMSCRIPT III SIMSCRIPT III Release 4.0 was available by 2009, and by then it ran on Windows 7, SUN OS and Linux and has Object oriented features.By 1997, SIMSCRIPT III already had a GUI interface to its compiler. The latest version is Release 5; earlier versions already supported 64 bit processing.  PL I implementation A PL I implementation was developed during 1968 1969, based on the public domain version released by RAND corporation.
