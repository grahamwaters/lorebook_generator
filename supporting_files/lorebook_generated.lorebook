            "text": "A Study in Scarlet is an 1887 detective novel by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle. The story marks the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become the most famous detective duo in literature. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes, a consulting detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his study in scarlet : There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. The story, and its main characters, attracted little public interest when it first appeared. Only 11 complete copies of the magazine in which the story first appeared, Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887, are known to exist now and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories featuring Holmes, A Study in Scarlet is one of only four full length novels in the original canon. The novel was followed by The Sign of the Four, published in 1890. A Study in Scarlet was the first work of detective fiction to incorporate the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.  Plot   Part I: The Reminiscences of Watson  In 1881, Doctor John Watson has returned to London after serving in the Second Anglo Afghan War. He is looking for a place to live, and an old friend tells him that Sherlock Holmes is looking for someone to split the rent at a flat at 221B Baker Street but cautions Watson about Holmes's eccentricities. Holmes and Watson meet, and after assessing each other and the rooms, they move in. Holmes reveals that he is a consulting detective and that his frequent guests are clients. After a demonstration of Holmes's deductive skills, Watson's disbelief turns into astonishment. A telegram requests a consultation in a murder case. Watson accompanies Holmes to the crime scene, an abandoned house on Brixton Road. Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade are already on the scene. The victim is identified as Enoch Drebber, and documents found on his person reveal that he has a secretary, Joseph Stangerson. On one wall, written in red, is RACHE , which Holmes dismisses as a ploy to fool the police. He deduces that the victim died from poison and supplies a description of the murderer. Upon moving Drebber's body, they discover a woman's gold wedding ring. Holmes places notices in several newspapers about the ring and buys a facsimile of it, hoping to draw the murderer who has apparently already tried to retrieve the ring out of hiding. An old woman answers the advertisement, claiming that the ring belongs to her daughter. Holmes gives her the duplicate and follows her, but she evades him. This leads Holmes to believe that she was an accomplice, or perhaps the actual murderer in disguise. A day later, Gregson visits Holmes and Watson, telling them that he has arrested a suspect. He had gone to Madame Charpentier's Boarding House where Drebber and Stangerson had stayed before the murder. He learned from her that Drebber, a drunk, had attempted to kiss Mrs. Charpentier's daughter, Alice, which caused their immediate eviction. Drebber, however, came back later that night and attempted to grab Alice, prompting her older brother to attack him. He attempted to chase Drebber with a cudgel but claimed to have lost sight of him. Gregson has him in custody on this circumstantial evidence. Lestrade then arrives and reveals that Stangerson has been murdered. His body was found near his hotel window, stabbed through the heart; above it was written RACHE . The only things Stangerson had with him were a novel, a pipe, a telegram saying J.H. is in Europe , and a small box containing two pills. Holmes tests the pills on an old and sickly Scottish terrier in residence at Baker Street. The first pill produces no evident effect, but the second kills the terrier. Holmes deduces that one was harmless and the other poison. Just at that moment, a very young street urchin named Wiggins arrives. He is the leader of the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of street children Holmes employs to help him occasionally. Wiggins states that he's summoned the cab Holmes wanted. Holmes sends him down to fetch the cabby, claiming to need help with his luggage. When the cabby comes upstairs and bends for the trunk, Holmes handcuffs and restrains him. He then announces the captive cabby as Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Drebber and Stangerson.  Part II: The Country of the Saints  The story flashes back to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah in 1847, where John Ferrier and a little girl named Lucy, the only survivors of a small party of pioneers, are rescued from death by a large party of Latter day Saints led by Brigham Young, but only on the condition that they adopt and live under the Mormon faith. Years later, a now grown Lucy befriends and falls in love with a man named Jefferson Hope. However, Young forbids her from marrying outside the faith, and demands that she marry either Joseph Stangerson or Enoch Drebber, both sons of members of the church's Council of Four. Ferrier, who has adopted Lucy and sworn to never marry his daughter to a Mormon, immediately sends word to Hope. Lucy is given one month to choose between her suitors. Hope finally arrives on the eve of the last day and they all escape under cover of darkness. The Mormons intercept the escapees while Hope is away hunting, as their food had run out. Ferrier is killed while Lucy is forcibly married to Drebber and dies a month later from a broken heart. Hope breaks into Drebber's house the night before Lucy's funeral to kiss her body and remove her wedding ring. He swears vengeance on Drebber and Stangerson, but he begins to suffer from an aortic aneurysm, causing him to leave the mountains to earn money and recuperate. When he returns several years later, he learns that Drebber and Stangerson have fled Salt Lake City after a schism between the Mormons. Hope pursues them, eventually tracking them to Cleveland, then to Europe. In London, Hope becomes a cabby and eventually finds Drebber and Stangerson. After the altercation with Madame Charpentier's son, Drebber gets into Hope's cab and spends several hours drinking. Eventually, Hope takes him to the house on Brixton Road, where Hope forces Drebber to recognize him and to choose between two pills, one of which is harmless and the other poison. Drebber takes the poisoned pill, and as he dies, Hope shows him Lucy's wedding ring. The excitement coupled with his aneurysm causes his nose to bleed; he uses the blood to write RACHE on the wall above Drebber to confound the investigators. Stangerson, on learning of Drebber's murder, refuses to leave his hotel room. Hope climbs in through the window and gives Stangerson the same choice of pills, but he is attacked and nearly strangled by Stangerson and forced to stab him in the heart. Hope dies from his aneurysm the night before he is to appear in court. Holmes reveals to Watson how he had deduced the identity of the murderer, then shows Watson the newspaper; Lestrade and Gregson are given full credit. Outraged, Watson states that Holmes should record the adventure and publish it. Upon Holmes's refusal, Watson decides to do it himself.  Publication Conan Doyle wrote the novel at the age of 27 in less than three weeks. As a doctor in general practice in Southsea, Hampshire, he had already published short stories in several magazines of the day, such as the periodical London Society. The story was originally titled A Tangled Skein, and was eventually published by Ward Lock Co. in Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887, after many rejections. Conan Doyle had pressed for royalty but instead received 25 in return for the full rights . It was illustrated by David Henry Friston. The novel was first published as a book in July 1888 by Ward, Lock Co., and featured drawings by the author's father, Charles Doyle. In 1890, J. B. Lippincott Co. released the first American version. Another edition published in 1891 by Ward, Lock Bowden Limited was illustrated by George Hutchinson. A German edition of the novel published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. Numerous further editions, translations and dramatisations have appeared since.  Depiction of Mormonism According to a Salt Lake City newspaper article, when Conan Doyle was asked about his depiction of the Latter day Saints' organisation as being steeped in kidnapping, murder and enslavement, he said: all I said about the Danite Band and the murders is historical so I cannot withdraw that, though it is likely that in a work of fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history. It's best to let the matter rest . Conan Doyle's daughter has stated: You know, father would be the first to admit that his first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons. Historians speculate that Conan Doyle, a voracious reader, would have access to books by Fannie Stenhouse, William A. Hickman, William Jarman, John Hyde and Ann Eliza Young, among others , in explaining the author's early perspective on Mormonism. Years after Conan Doyle's death, Levi Edgar Young, a descendant of Brigham Young and a Mormon general authority, alleged that Conan Doyle had privately apologised, saying that He Conan Doyle said he had been misled by writings of the time about the Church and had written a scurrilous book about the Mormons. In August 2011, the Albemarle County, Virginia, School Board removed A Study in Scarlet from the district's sixth grade required reading list following complaints from students and parents that the book was derogatory toward Mormons. It was moved to the reading lists for the tenth graders, and remains in use in the school media centres for all grades.  Adaptations   Film  As the first Sherlock Holmes story published, A Study in Scarlet was among the first to be adapted to the screen. In 1914, Conan Doyle authorised a British silent film be produced by G. B. Samuelson. In the film, titled A Study in Scarlet, Holmes was played by James Bragington, an accountant who worked as an actor for the only time of his life. He was hired for his resemblance to Holmes, as presented in the sketches originally published with the story. As early silent films were made with film that itself was made with poor materials, and film archiving was then rare, it is now a lost film. The film was successful enough for Samuelson to produce the 1916 film The Valley of Fear.A two reel short film, also titled A Study in Scarlet, was released in the United States in 1914, a day after the British film with the same title was released. The American film starred Francis Ford as Holmes and was not authorised by Doyle. It is also a lost film.The 1933 film titled A Study in Scarlet, starring Reginald Owen as Sherlock Holmes and Anna May Wong as Mrs Pyke, bears no plot relation to the novel. Aside from Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Inspector Lestrade, the only connections to the Holmes canon are a few lifts of character names . The plot contains an element of striking resemblance to one used several years later in Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted A Study in Scarlet into a four part serial for the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episodes aired in November and December 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Parts of the story were combined with The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton for the script of Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes , one of multiple radio adaptations featuring John Gielgud as Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Watson. The episode first aired on the BBC Light Programme on 5 October 1954, and also aired on NBC radio on 2 January 1955.The story was adapted for the 1952 1969 BBC radio series in 1962 by Michael Hardwick, with Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. It aired on the BBC Home Service.Another British radio version of the story adapted by Hardwick aired on 25 December 1974, with Robert Powell as Sherlock Holmes and Dinsdale Landon as Watson. The cast also included Frederick Treves as Inspector Gregson, John Hollis as Inspector Lestrade, and Don Fellows as Jefferson Hope.A radio dramatisation of the story aired on CBS Radio Mystery Theater during its 1977 season, with Kevin McCarthy as Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.A Study in Scarlet was adapted as the first two episodes of the BBC's complete Sherlock Holmes 1989 1998 radio series. The two part adaptation aired on Radio 4 in 1989, dramatised by Bert Coules and starring Clive Merrison as Holmes, Michael Williams as Watson, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and John Moffatt as Inspector Gregson.It was adapted as a 2007 episode of the American radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes, Lawrence Albert as Watson, Rick May as Lestrade, and John Murray as Gregson.  Television  The 1954 1955 television series used only the first section of the book as the basis for the episode The Case of the Cunningham Heritage .The book was adapted into an episode broadcast on 23 September 1968 in the second season of the BBC television series Sherlock Holmes, with Peter Cushing in the lead role and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson. It was adapted as the second episode of the 1979 Soviet television film, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson .A 1983 animated television film adaptation was produced by Burbank Films Australia, with Peter O'Toole voicing Holmes. In both the 1968 television adaptation featuring Peter Cushing and the 1983 animated version featuring Peter O'Toole, the story is changed so that Holmes and Watson already know each other and have been living at 221B Baker Street for some time. A Study in Scarlet is one of the stories missing from the adaptations made starring Jeremy Brett between 1984 and 1994. Steven Moffat loosely adapted A Study in Scarlet into A Study in Pink as the first episode of the 2010 BBC television series Sherlock featuring Benedict Cumberbatch as a 21st century Sherlock Holmes, and Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson. The adaptation retains many individual elements from the story, such as the scribbled RACHE and the two pills, and the killer's potentially fatal aneurysm . However, the entire backstory set in America is omitted, and the motivation of the killer is completely different. It also features Moriarty's presence. Also, the meeting of Holmes and Watson is adapted in the Victorian setting in the special The Abominable Bride . The Deductionist , an episode of Elementary, contains many elements of Hope's case, including the motivation of revenge. The story was more closely adapted in the season 4 episode, A Study in Charlotte. The First Adventure , the first episode of the 2014 NHK puppetry series Sherlock Holmes, is loosely based on A Study in Scarlet and The Adventure of the Six Napoleons . In it, Holmes, Watson and Lestrade are pupils at a fictional boarding school called Beeton School. They find out that a pupil called Jefferson Hope has taken revenge on Enoch Drebber and Joseph Stangerson for stealing his watch. Scarlet Story , the series' opening theme tune, is named after the novel and the name of Beeton School is partially inspired by Beeton's Christmas Annual.  Other media  A Study in Scarlet was illustrated by Seymour Moskowitz for Classics Illustrated comics in 1953. It was also adapted to graphic novel form by Innovation Publishing in 1969 by Sterling Publishing in 2010 and by Hakon Holm Publishing in 2013 .In 2014, A Study in Scarlet was adapted again for the stage by Greg Freeman, Lila Whelan and Annabelle Brown for Tacit Theatre. The production premiered at Southwark Playhouse in London in March 2014.In February 2019, a new adaptation of A Study in Scarlet was staged at DM Performance Works at the Factory in Nuremberg, PA. It was adapted by Bill Amos under the title Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Avenger .In June 2022, Pitlochry Festival Theatre will produce a brand new adaptation by playwright and actor Lesley Hart. Sherlock Holmes; A Study in Lipstick, Ketchup and Blood performed in an outdoor amphitheater by two performers.  Allusions in other works In his Naked is the Best Disguise , Samuel Rosenberg notes the similarity between Jefferson Hope's tracking of Enoch Drebber and a sequence in James Joyce's novel Ulysses, though of course Joyce's work did not begin to appear in print until 1918. Several other associations between Conan Doyle and Joyce are also listed in Rosenberg's book. The British fantasy and comic book writer Neil Gaiman adapted this story to the universe of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. The new short story is titled A Study in Emerald and is modelled with a parallel structure. In Garage Sale Mystery: The Novel Murders , the second murder is an imitation of this murder. In The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve , a character by the name of Enoch Drebber appears in the third case. Rather than a Mormon that forced a woman into an abusive marriage and was killed for it, Drebber is instead a brilliant scientist and engineer who worked on a device to get revenge on the man that ruined his life.

            "text": "The Sign of the Four , also called The Sign of Four, is the second novel featuring Sherlock Holmes by British writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories featuring the fictional detective.  Plot Set in 1888, The Sign of the Four has a complex plot involving service in India, the Indian Mutiny of 1857, a stolen treasure, and a secret pact among four convicts and two corrupt prison guards. It presents Holmes's drug habit and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel, A Study in Scarlet . It also introduces Dr. Watson's future wife, Mary Morstan. According to Mary, in December 1878, her father had telegraphed her upon his safe return from India and requested her to meet him at the Langham Hotel in London. When Mary arrived at the hotel, she was told her father had gone out the previous night and not returned. Despite all efforts, no trace was ever found of him. Mary contacted her father's only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to England, one Major John Sholto, but he denied knowing her father had returned. The second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor, one per year since 1882, after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her. With the last pearl she received a letter remarking that she has been wronged and asking for a meeting. Holmes takes the case and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died in 1882 and that within a short span of time Mary began to receive the pearls, implying a connection. The only clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk with the names of Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar. Holmes, Watson, and Mary meet Thaddeus Sholto, the son of the late Major Sholto and the anonymous sender of the pearls. Thaddeus confirms the Major had seen Mary's father the night he died; they had arranged a meeting to divide a priceless treasure Sholto had brought home from India. While quarrelling over the treasure, Captain Morstan long in weak health suffered a heart attack. Not wanting to bring attention to the object of the quarrel and also worried that circumstances would suggest that he had killed Morstan in an argument, particularly since Morstan's head struck the corner of the chest as he fell Sholto disposed of the body and hid the treasure. However, Sholto himself suffered from poor health and an enlarged spleen . His health deteriorated when he received a letter from India in early 1882. Dying, he called his two sons and confessed to Morstan's death; he was about to divulge the location of the treasure when he suddenly cried, Keep him out! before falling back and dying. The puzzled sons glimpsed a face in the window, but the only trace was a single footstep in the dirt. On their father's body is a note reading The Sign of the Four . Both brothers quarrelled over whether a legacy should be left to Mary, and Thaddeus left his brother Bartholomew, taking a chaplet and sending its pearls to her. The reason he sent the letter is that Bartholomew has found the treasure and possibly Thaddeus and Mary might confront him for a division of it. All of the party travel to the Sholto family home, Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood, to confront brother Bartholomew. Bartholomew is found dead in his home from a poisoned dart and the treasure is missing. While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one legged man, Jonathan Small, and a small accomplice. He traces them to a boat landing where Small has hired a steam launch named the Aurora. With the help of dog Toby that he sends Watson to collect from Mr. Sherman, the Baker Street Irregulars and his own disguise, Holmes traces the steam launch. In a police steam launch Holmes and Watson chase the Aurora and capture it, but in the process end up killing the small companion after he attempts to kill Holmes with a poisoned dart shot from a blow pipe. Small tries to escape but is captured. However, the iron treasure box is empty; Small claims to have dumped the treasure over the side during the chase. Small confesses that years before he was a soldier of the Third Buffs in India and lost his right leg to a crocodile while bathing in the Ganges. After some time, when he was an overseer on a tea plantation, the 1857 rebellion occurred and he was forced to flee for his life to the Agra fortress. While standing guard one night he was overpowered by two Sikh troopers, who gave him a choice of being killed or being an accomplice to waylaying a disguised servant of a rajah who had sent said servant with a valuable fortune in pearls and jewels to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place and the crime was discovered, although the jewels were not. Small got penal servitude on the Andaman Islands. After twenty years, Small overheard that Major Sholto had lost much money gambling and couldn't even sell his commission, necessitating his resignation. Small saw his chance and made a deal with Sholto and Captain Morstan: Sholto would recover the treasure and in return send a boat to pick up Small and the Sikhs. Sholto double crossed both Morstan and Small and stole the treasure for himself after inheriting a fortune from his uncle. Small vowed vengeance and four years later escaped the Andaman Islands with an islander named Tonga after they both killed a prison guard. It was the news of his escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location, but left the note which referred to the name of the pact between himself and his three Sikh accomplices. When Bartholomew found the treasure, Small planned to only steal it, but claims a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew as well. Small claims the treasure brought nothing but bad luck to anyone who came in touch with it the servant who was murdered; Sholto living with fear and guilt; and now he himself is trapped in slavery for life half his life building a breakwater in the Andaman Islands and the rest of his life digging drains in Dartmoor Prison. Mary is left without the bulk of the Agra treasure, although she will apparently receive the rest of the chaplet. Watson falls in love with Mary and it is revealed at the end that he proposed to her and she has accepted.  Publication history  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner with Joseph Marshall Stoddart, managing editor of the American publication Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, at the Langham Hotel in London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version of Lippincott s with a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended by Oscar Wilde, who eventually contributed The Picture of Dorian Gray to the July 1890 issue. Doyle discussed what he called this golden evening in his 1924 autobiography Memories and Adventures. The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine as The Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos, appearing in both London and Philadelphia. The British edition of the magazine originally sold for a shilling, and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars. Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re serialisations gave the title as The Sign of Four. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 by Spencer Blackett, again using the title The Sign of Four. This edition included a frontispiece illustrated by Charles H. M. Kerr. The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second the of the original title. A German edition of the book published in 1902 was illustrated by Richard Gutschmidt. An edition published by George Newnes Ltd in 1903 was illustrated by F. H. Townsend.Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four word form. The actual text in the novel nearly always uses the Sign of the Four to describe the symbol in the story, although the four word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story. As with the first story, A Study in Scarlet, produced two years previously, The Sign of the Four was not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards in Strand Magazine, that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.  Adaptations   Television and film  There have been multiple film and television adaptations of the book:  Radio  A radio adaptation of the story was broadcast on New York radio station WGY on 9 November 1922. The cast included Edward H. Smith as Sherlock Holmes, F. H. Oliver as Dr. Watson, and Viola Karwowska as Mary Morstan. It was produced as part of a series of adaptations of plays, so it is likely that the script was based on an existing stage adaptation of the story .A six part adaptation of the novel aired in the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Adapted by Edith Meiser, the episodes aired from 9 November 1932 to 14 December 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.The book was adapted by Felix Felton for the BBC Light Programme in 1959. Richard Hurndall played Holmes and Bryan Coleman played Watson.In 1963, the story was dramatised by Michael Hardwick for the BBC Home Service as part of the 1952 1969 radio series, with Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.CBS Radio Mystery Theater aired a radio version of the story in 1977, starring Kevin McCarthy as Holmes and Court Benson as Watson.The Sign of the Four was adapted for radio by Bert Coules in 1989 as part of BBC Radio 4's complete Sherlock Holmes 1989 1998 radio series, with Clive Merrison as Holmes, Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Brian Blessed as Jonathan Small.In 2016, the story was adapted as an episode of the American radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Stage  Paul Giovanni's 1978 play The Crucifer of Blood is based on the novel. The Broadway premiere featured Paxton Whitehead as Holmes and Timothy Landfield as Watson. The 1979 London production featured Keith Michell as Holmes and Denis Lill as Watson.

            "text": "The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the four crime novels by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. Originally serialised in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902, it is set in 1889 largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Holmes and Watson investigate the case. This was the first appearance of Holmes since his apparent death in The Final Problem , and the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's eventual revival.One of the most famous stories ever written, in 2003, the book was listed as number 128 of 200 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's best loved novel . In 1999, a poll of Sherlockians ranked it as the best of the four Holmes novels.  Plot  Dr James Mortimer recounts to Sherlock Holmes in London an old legend of a curse that reportedly runs in the Baskerville family since the time of the English Civil War, when Sir Hugo Baskerville was killed by a huge demonic hound, with the same creature haunting the mires of Dartmoor ever since, causing the premature death of many Baskerville heirs. He reveals that his friend Sir Charles Baskerville, who took the legend of the hound seriously, was found dead in the yew alley of his estate, Baskerville Hall, in the midst of Dartmoor. The death was attributed to a heart attack, but Mortimer reveals that Sir Charles's face retained an expression of horror, and not far from his body were the footprints of a gigantic hound. Mortimer now fears for the next in line, Sir Henry Baskerville. Though he dismisses the curse as nonsense, Holmes agrees to meet Sir Henry, who is arriving from Canada, where he has been living. A young and jovial man, Sir Henry is sceptical about the legend and is eager to take possession of Baskerville Hall, in spite of receiving an anonymous note, warning him to stay away from the moor. When someone shadows Sir Henry while he is walking down a street, however, Holmes asks Watson to go with the Sir Henry and Mortimer to Dartmoor, in order to protect Sir Henry and search for any clues about who is following him. The trio arrive at Baskerville Hall. It has a married couple, the Barrymores, as butler and housekeeper. The estate is surrounded by the moor and borders the Grimpen Mire, where animals and humans can sink to death. The news that a convict named Selden, a murderer, has escaped from nearby Dartmoor Prison and is hiding in the nearby barren hills adds to the gloomy atmosphere. There are inexplicable events during the first night, keeping the Sir Henry and Watson awake, and only in the daylight do they relax while exploring the neighbourhood and meeting the few residents. Watson keeps searching for any lead to the identity of whoever is following Sir Henry, and faithfully sends details of his investigations to Holmes. Among the residents, the Stapletons, brother and sister, stand out: Jack is overfriendly and too curious toward Sir Henry and Watson, while Beryl, a beautiful woman, seems all too weary of the place and attempts to warn Sir Henry, via Watson, of danger. Distant howls and strange sightings trouble Watson during his long walks among the hills, and his mood is no better inside Baskerville Hall. Watson grows suspicious of the butler Barrymore, who at night is signalling from a window of the house with a candle, to someone on the moor. Meanwhile, Sir Henry is drawn to Beryl, who seems to be afraid of her brother's attitude to any relationship. To make the puzzle more complex there is Dr. Mortimer, who is all too eager to convince Sir Henry that the curse is real; Frankland, an old and grumpy neighbour, who likes to pry on others with his telescope; his estranged daughter Laura, who had unclear ties to Sir Charles; and even a unknown man roaming free on the moor and apparently hiding on a tor where ancient tombs have been excavated by Mortimer. Watson investigates the man on the tor, and discovers that it has been Holmes, who has been hiding on the moor all the time and is close to solving the mystery. He reveals that the hound is real and belongs to Stapleton, who promised Laura marriage and convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house at night, in order to frighten him with the hound. Beryl is in fact Jack Stapleton's wife, abused and forced into posing as his sister so as to influence Sir Henry and expose him as well to the hound. The hound kills a man on the moor whom Holmes and Watson fear is Sir Henry, but Barrymore had given the former's clothes to Selden, who is his brother in law, and Selden dies instead. Holmes decides to use Baskerville as bait to catch Stapleton red handed by having Sir Henry accept an invitation to Stapleton's house and walk back after dark, giving his enemy every chance to unleash the hound on him. Holmes and Watson pretend to leave Dartmoor by train, but instead they hide near Stapleton's house with Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. Despite the dark and a thick fog, Holmes and Watson are able to kill the hound when it attacks Sir Henry. They find in Stapleton s house the bound and badly abused Beryl, while Stapleton, in his panicked flight from the scene, seemingly drowns in the mire. Back in London, Holmes remarks to Watson that not only was Stapleton a physical and spiritual throwback to Sir Hugo Baskerville, being a lost relation of Sir Charles, but also that he was one of the most formidable foes Holmes had ever encountered.  Origins and background  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote this story shortly after returning to his home Undershaw in Surrey from South Africa, where he had worked as a volunteer physician at the Langman Field Hospital in Bloemfontein during the Second Boer War. He had not written about Sherlock Holmes in eight years, having killed off the character in the 1893 story The Final Problem . Although The Hound of the Baskervilles is set before the latter events, two years later Conan Doyle brought Holmes back for good, explaining in The Adventure of the Empty House that Holmes had faked his own death. He was assisted with the legend of the hound and local colour by a Daily Express journalist named Bertram Fletcher Robinson , with whom he explored Dartmoor in June, 1901, and to whom a 1 3 royalty which amounted to over 500 pounds by the end of 1901.Conan Doyle may also have been inspired by his own earlier story of a terrifying giant wolf, The King of the Foxes.  Inspiration His ideas came from the legend of Squire Richard Cabell of Brook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, Devon, which was the fundamental inspiration for the Baskerville tale of a hellish hound and a cursed country squire. Cabell's tomb survives in the town of Buckfastleigh.Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a monstrously evil man . He gained this reputation, amongst other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to the Devil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter of Sir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet , of Fowelscombe. On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed.Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as the Yeth hound that Conan Doyle may have heard.Weller believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor: Fowelscombe in the parish of Ugborough, the seat of the Fowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh of Fowelscombe and Brook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell. It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.Still other tales claim that Conan Doyle was inspired by a holiday in North Norfolk, where the tale of Black Shuck is well known. The pre Gothic Cromer Hall, where Conan Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of Love's Old Sweet Song , married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville of Crowsley Park, Oxfordshire. The gates to the park had statues of hell hounds, spears through their mouths. Above the lintel there was another statue of a hell hound.  Technique The novel incorporates five plots: the ostensible 'curse' story, the two red herring subplots concerning Selden and the other stranger living on the moor, the actual events occurring to Baskerville as narrated by Watson, and the hidden plot to be discovered by Holmes. Doyle wrote that the novel was originally conceived as a straight 'Victorian creeper' , with the idea of introducing Holmes as the deus ex machina only arising later.  Publication The Hound of the Baskervilles was first serialized in The Strand Magazine in 1901. It was well suited for this type of publication, as individual chapters end in cliffhangers. It was printed in the United Kingdom as a novel in March 1902 by George Newnes Ltd. It was published in the same year in the United States by McClure, Philips Co.  Original manuscript  In 1902, Doyle's original manuscript of the book was broken up into individual leaves as part of a promotional campaign by Doyle's American publisher they were used in window displays by individual booksellers. Out of an estimated 185 190 leaves, only 37 are known still to exist, including all the leaves from Chapter 11, held by the New York Public Library. Other leaves are owned by university libraries and private collectors.A newly rediscovered example was sold at auction in 2012 for US 158,500.

Related works The film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp makes references to The Hound of the Baskervilles. Mad magazine satirized this novel in issue 16 as The Hound of the Basketballs , art by Bill Elder. Disney cartoonist Carl Barks parodied this story with The Hound of the Whiskervilles , starring Uncle Scrooge. A 1965 issue of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories featured The Hound of Basketville, starring Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Gladstone Gander, and Pluto, as Sherlock Mouse, Doctor Goofy, Sir Gladstone Basketville, and the hound. In 1971, German schlager vocal duo Cindy Bert covered Black Sabbath's groundbreaking 1970 heavy metal song Paranoid with lyrics based on The Hound of the Baskervilles as Der Hund von Baskerville . The unlikely cover version with a heavy hammond organ, featured in a TV show with a tiny Pekingese dog standing in as hound and dancers getting ushered back to their seats, has become a collector's curiosity and a document of 1971 zeitgeist. Stapleton reappears in Richard L. Boyer's version of The Giant Rat of Sumatra . It turns out that he did not die, as Holmes and Watson assumed, but had escaped by another route, committing further crimes and vowing vengeance on Sherlock Holmes. William of Baskerville, protagonist of Umberto Eco's novel The Name of the Rose , is a Franciscan friar and a sleuth, inspired by Sherlock Holmes and perhaps William of Occam and other real and fictional characters. The Hound of Baskerville played a short role in the animated feature The Pagemaster . The hound of the Baskervilles is a character in Kouta Hirano's supernatural manga series Hellsing . Spike Milligan satirised the novel in his book, The Hound of the Baskervilles According to Spike Milligan , combining elements of the original novel with the Basil Rathbone serials. The Moor , a novel in Laurie R. King's series about Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell, uses the setting and various plot elements, with Holmes returning to Dartmoor on a later case. Pierre Bayard's book Sherlock Holmes Was Wrong re opens the case and, by careful re examination of all the clues, clears the hound of all wrongdoing and argues that the actual murderer got away with the crime completely unsuspected by Holmes, countless readers of the book over the past century and even, in a sense, the author himself. The Hound of Baskervilles mysterious elements were used as inspiration for the demon hound Pluto in the anime Black Butler .

            "text": "The Valley of Fear is the fourth and final Sherlock Holmes novel by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle. It is loosely based on the Molly Maguires and Pinkerton agent James McParland. The story was first published in the Strand Magazine between September 1914 and May 1915. The first book edition was copyrighted in 1914, and it was first published by George H. Doran Company in New York on 27 February 1915, and illustrated by Arthur I. Keller.  Plot Sherlock Holmes receives a cipher message from Fred Porlock, a pseudonymous agent of Professor Moriarty. After Porlock sends the message, however, he changes his mind for fear of Moriarty's discovering that he is a traitor. He decides not to send the key to the cipher, but he sends Holmes a note telling of this decision. From the cipher message and the second note, Holmes is able to deduce that it is a book cipher and that the book used for the encryption is a common book, large , printed in two columns per page, and standardised. An almanac fits these conditions exactly. Holmes tries the latest edition of Whitaker's Almanac, which he had only received a few days earlier, and fails; he then tries the previous edition. With this almanac, Holmes is able to decipher the message as a warning of a nefarious plot against one Douglas, a country gentleman residing at Birlstone House. Some minutes later, Inspector MacDonald arrives at 221B Baker Street with news that a Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor House, Birlstone, Sussex, has been murdered. Holmes tells MacDonald of Porlock's warning, suggesting Moriarty's involvement. However, MacDonald does not fully believe that the educated and well respected Moriarty is a criminal. Holmes, Watson, and MacDonald travel to Birlstone House, an ancient moated manor house, to investigate the crime. Douglas had been murdered the evening before. Cecil Barker, a frequent guest at Birlstone House, had been in his room at half past eleven when he heard the report of a gun, according to his testimony. He had rushed down to find Douglas lying in the centre of the room nearest the front door of the house, a sawn off shotgun lying across his chest. He had been shot at close range: receiving the full charge of the shotgun in the face, his head was blown 'almost to pieces'. Barker had rushed to the village police station and notified Sergeant Wilson, who was in charge of the station. Wilson followed Barker to the house after notifying the county authorities. Wilson had begun investigating immediately. Barker drew his attention to the open window, and to a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot sole upon the window sill. The drawbridge over the moat had been raised at 6:00 pm. Barker speculated that the murderer had entered by the drawbridge before that time, hid in the room, and left by the window directly after killing Douglas. The moat was only a few feet deep, and could be easily crossed. Wilson found a card beside the corpse with the initials V.V. and the number 341 beneath them. Muddy boot prints were found behind the curtains, bearing out Barker's theory. On the murdered man's forearm was a curious design, a triangle within a circle; it was not a tattoo, but a brand. This mark had been noticed many times before upon John Douglas's forearm. Douglas' wedding ring appeared to have been taken from his hand. The chief Sussex detective, White Mason, had arrived at Birlstone House by 3:00 in the morning. By 5:45, he had sent for Scotland Yard. MacDonald took the case, and notified Holmes because he thought Holmes would be interested. By noon, MacDonald, Holmes and Watson meet White Mason in Birlstone. Holmes, MacDonald, and White Mason go to the scene of the murder. They discuss the case, agreeing that suicide is out of the question, and that someone from outside the house committed the murder. Barker believes a secret society of men pursued Douglas, and that he retreated to rural England out of fear for his life. Douglas married after arriving in England five years earlier. His first wife had died of typhoid. He had met and worked with Barker in America before departing for Europe. Some episode of Douglas's life in America caused the fear for his life, and Mrs. Douglas said her husband mentioned something called The Valley of Fear . By studying Barker's slippers, Holmes determines Barker's shoe made the mark on the window, to give the appearance that someone exited that way. In their lodgings, Holmes tells Watson that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are certainly lying: the events as they tell them would be impossible. Moreover, Holmes learns that the housekeeper heard a sound, as if of a door slamming, half an hour before the alarm; Holmes believes that this sound was the fatal shot. White Mason and MacDonald track a bicycle found on the grounds of the house to an American staying at a guest house. The American appears to be the murderer, but there is no sign of the man. Holmes asks MacDonald to write to Barker, telling him that the police intend to search the moat the next day. That night Holmes, Watson, MacDonald and White Mason lie in wait outside Birlstone Manor and see Barker fish something out of the moat. The four men rush Barker and discover the bundle from the moat contains the clothes of the missing American connected with the bicycle. Barker refuses to explain the situation. At that moment, Douglas appears, alive and well. He hands Watson a written account called The Valley of Fear , which explains why he feared for his life. Douglas explains that he had spotted an enemy of his, Ted Baldwin, in the area and expected an attack. When Baldwin attempted to shoot Douglas in his study, Douglas grabbed the gun and, in the struggle, Baldwin was shot in the face. With Barker's help, Douglas dressed the man in his own clothes, except for Douglas's wedding ring, to deceive the secret society which he and Baldwin had belonged to, since both arms bore the society's mark. Barker and Mrs. Douglas had covered for Douglas, who had been hiding in a secret compartment in the room where the shooting occurred. In an interview with Watson, Douglas explains that his real name was Birdy Edwards and he had been a Pinkerton detective in Chicago. Edwards had infiltrated a murderous gang, known by locals as the Scowrers, in Vermissa Valley and brought them to justice. Afterwards, the criminals attempted to kill him after being released from jail. Hounded, Douglas had run to England, where he met and married his second wife. Holmes urges Douglas to leave England and warns that a new threat now hangs over him. Douglas takes this advice, but, shortly after, Holmes learns from Barker that Douglas was lost overboard on the vessel to Africa. Holmes believes Moriarty was responsible for ending Douglas' life. Holmes wants to bring Moriarty down, but warns Watson and Barker that it will take some time to achieve.  Background Birlstone Manor in the novel is closely based on Groombridge Place near Tunbridge Wells, Kent.The backstory of The Valley of Fear was loosely based on the Molly Maguires.  Publication history The Valley of Fear was first serialised in The Strand Magazine from September 1914 to May 1915. In the Strand, it was published with thirty one illustrations by Frank Wiles. It was first published in book form by George H. Doran Company in New York on 27 February 1915, before the serialisation had finished in the Strand. The first British book edition was published by Smith, Elder Co. on 3 June 1915. Like the first Holmes novel A Study in Scarlet, The Valley of Fear has two parts. The first part is titled The Tragedy of Birlstone , and the second is titled The Scowrers .  Structure and themes Unlike many of the other Holmes novels, mostly linear entertainments, Doyle crafted The Valley of Fear as two parts and a coda and carefully stage managed the elements of fear and terror .The novel has a number of major themes, including problems of ethical ambiguity , and attempts to comment seriously on terrorist activity as profiled by American union struggles. Critics have shown how the American union struggles deal with similar issues in the contemporary political situation in Ireland.  Adaptations   Film  Several films have adapted the book, among them: The Valley of Fear , a silent film starring H.A. Saintsbury and Booth Conway. The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes , a British film starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Ian Fleming as Watson. Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace , although intended to be an adaptation of The Valley of Fear, only minor elements of the story remained in the final film. Sherlock Holmes and the Valley of Fear , an animated film starring Peter O'Toole as the voice of Holmes.  Television  The Case of the Pennsylvania Gun , an episode of the television series Sherlock Holmes starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. La valle della paura , episodes 1 2 3 of the Italian television series Sherlock Holmes starring Nando Gazzolo as Holmes and Gianni Bonagura as Watson. The Crime Machine , an episode of the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century , with Jason Gray Stanford voicing Holmes and John Payne voicing Watson. Despite the opening credits saying the episode is inspired by The Valley of Fear, there is actually no connection between the two. An episode of the puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes was loosely based on the story. The Final Problem , the final episode of the 4th series of the BBC series Sherlock, makes a reference to Moriarty's brother being a station master, albeit switching the original role of railway station master for a broadcast station master.  Radio  The Valley of Fear was the only Sherlock Holmes story not adapted for the 1930s radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and was not adapted for radio until 1960. Radio adaptations of the story include: A 1960 BBC Home Service adaptation, dramatised by Michael Hardwick as part of the 1952 1969 radio series, starring Carleton Hobbs and Norman Shelley, and featuring Garard Green as Inspector Mason.

            "text": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, first published on 14 October 1892. It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of The Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson and all are related in first person narrative from Watson's point of view. In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, A Scandal in Bohemia , includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking The Adventure of the Speckled Band as his overall favourite.  Context  Arthur Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine at university in the late 1870s, and had his first short story, The Mystery of Sasassa Valley , published in September 1879. Eight years later his first Sherlock Holmes story, the novel A Study in Scarlet, was published by Ward Lock Co. It was well received, but Doyle was paid little for it; after a sequel novel, The Sign of the Four, was published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, he shifted his focus to short stories. Soon after The Strand Magazine was inaugurated in January 1891, its editor Herbert Greenhough Smith received two submissions to the new monthly from Doyle. Later he described his reaction: I at once realised that here was the greatest short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe. The first of them, A Scandal in Bohemia , was published near the back of the July issue with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget. The stories proved popular, helping to boost the circulation of the magazine, and Doyle was paid 30 guineas each for the initial run of twelve. These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892, and then were collected together and published as a book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of The Strand Magazine. The initial print run of the book was for 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and a further 4,500 copies in the United States, which were published by Harper Brothers the following day.Sidney Paget illustrated all twelve stories in The Strand and in the collection. The preceding Holmes novels had been illustrated by other artists.  Stories   Summary  All of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as a king's betrayal of an opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent. It suggests that, in contrast, Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of official incompetence and aristocratic privilege . The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were The Adventure of the Speckled Band , The Red Headed League , A Scandal in Bohemia and The Five Orange Pips . The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged occultism , but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and the restriction was lifted in 1940.  Publication sequence   Critical reception  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were well received upon their serialisation in The Strand Magazine. Following the publication of A Scandal in Bohemia in July 1891, the Hull Daily Mail described the story as being worthy of the inventive genius of Doyle. Just over a year later, when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a piece in the Belfast News Letter reviewed a story by another author in The Strand Magazine saying that it might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago , but that the unique power of Doyle's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories. The Leeds Mercury particularly praised the characterisation of Holmes, with all his little foibles , while in contrast the Cheltenham Looker On described Holmes as rather a bore sometimes , noting that descriptions of his foibles grows wearisome . The correspondent for Hampshire Telegraph lamented the fact that Doyle's more thoughtful writing, such as Micah Clarke, was not so popular as the Holmes stories, concluding that an author who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want .  Adaptations Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays, and the character has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films. A number of film and television series have borne the title The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , but some of these are either original stories, combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation of The Sign of the Four.Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, A Scandal in Bohemia , is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story. Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty's Elementary and the BBC's Sherlock, even though in the story itself, the narration claims: It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. In his Sherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes Adler connection. Multiple series have featured adaptations of all or nearly all of the stories in this collection, including the 1921 1923 Stoll film series , the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , the 1939 1950 radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , and the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1952 1969 radio series. Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in the Granada Television series Sherlock Holmes which ran from 1984 until 1994. The stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 1991 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1989 1998 radio series, and were adapted as episodes of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes . The stories within the collection have also been adapted for many other productions.  References  Citation Doyle, Arthur Conan . Klinger, Leslie . The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes. Volume I.

            "text": "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, first published late in 1893 with 1894 date. It was first published in the UK by G. Newnes Ltd., and was published in the US by Harper Brothers in February 1894. It was the second collection featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, following The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Like the first it was illustrated by Sidney Paget. The twelve stories were originally published in The Strand Magazine from December 1892 to December 1893 as The Adventures number 13 to 24. For instance, The Final Problem was published under the subheading XXIV. The Adventure of the Final Problem. In the United States, the stories were first published in Harper's Weekly, except for The Final Problem, which appeared in McClure's Magazine. Doyle determined that these would be the last Holmes stories, and intended to kill off the character in The Final Problem . Reader demand stimulated him to write another Holmes novel in 1901 1902, The Hound of the Baskervilles, set before The Final Problem . The next year a new series, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, begins with the aftermath of The Final Problem , in which it is revealed that Holmes actually survived.  Contents The sequence of stories matches that of the magazine series, December 1892 to December 1893, when The Adventure of the Naval Treaty was published in two parts, October and November. The Adventure of Silver Blaze The Adventure of the Cardboard Box not in the first edition, nor many other eds. The Adventure of the Yellow Face The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk The Adventure of the Gloria Scott The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual The Adventure of the Reigate Squire The Adventure of the Crooked Man The Adventure of the Resident Patient The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter The Adventure of the Naval Treaty The Final Problem  Omissions of The Adventure of the Cardboard Box  The first London edition of the Memoirs in 1894 did not include The Adventure of the Cardboard Box , although all twelve stories had appeared in the Strand Magazine. The first U.S. edition included the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle's request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public. As a result, this story was not republished until many years later, when it was added to His Last Bow. Today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Additionally, when the story was removed from the Memoirs, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of The Adventure of the Resident Patient . In some later U.S. editions of the Memoirs, which still omit The Adventure of the Cardboard Box , this transfer still appears.  Adaptations Several series have included adaptations of all or almost all of the stories in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. All the stories in the collection were adapted as short films for the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series , and as part of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes . All except The Yellow Face and The Final Problem were dramatised in the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , and all except The Yellow Face and The Gloria Scott were adapted for BBC radio in the Sherlock Holmes 1952 1969 radio series. Eight of the stories were adapted as episodes of the Granada television series . Only one story, The Cardboard Box was adapted for the last part of the series which had the title The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. All the stories in the collection were adapted for BBC Radio 4 as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1989 1998 radio series, and all were adapted for the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes . The individual stories included in the collection have also been adapted for various other productions.

The War Service of Sherlock Holmes . The collection's first US edition adjusts the anthology's subtitle to Some Later Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes. All editions contain a brief preface, by John H. Watson, M.D. , that assures readers that as of the date of publication Holmes is long retired from his profession of detective but is still alive and well, albeit suffering from a touch of rheumatism.  Publication history The book was published in the UK by John Murray in October 1917, and in the US by George H. Doran Co. that same month.The collection contains The Adventure of the Cardboard Box , which was also included in the first edition of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes but was dropped from later editions of that book. Six of the stories were published in The Strand Magazine between September 1908 and December 1913. The Strand published The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge as A Reminiscence of Sherlock Holmes and divided it into two parts, called The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles and The Tiger of San Pedro . Later printings of His Last Bow correct Wistaria to Wisteria. The final story, His Last Bow. The War Service of Sherlock Holmes , an epilogue about Holmes' war service, was first published in Collier's on 22 September 1917 one month before the book's premiere on 22 October.

            "text": "The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes is the final set of twelve Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle first published in the Strand Magazine between October 1921 and April 1927.  Title of collection The first British edition of the collection, published by John Murray, and the first American edition, published by George H. Doran Co., were both published in June 1927. However, they had slightly different titles. The title of the British collection was The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes , whereas the title of the American edition was The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . Further confusing the issue of the title, some later publishers released the collection under the title The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes .  Contents The first edition of The Case Book, published by John Murray in 1927, does not present the stories in the order in which they were published:  Copyright history and challenges In the United States, two of the short stories from The Case Book, The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger and The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place , are the last two Sherlock Holmes works by Doyle still protected by copyright. They will enter the public domain on 1 January 2023, the year after the 95th anniversary of the stories' publication. The copyrights expired in 1980 in the United Kingdom and Canada. The Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. claim they hold the American copyrights. The company has a web page setting out its views about other claimants to those rights.In 2013, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois handed down a ruling about copyright protection, not for the stories themselves, but for the characters of Holmes and Watson. The defendant in the case was Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. The plaintiff was well known Sherlockian editor, and Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, Leslie S. Klinger. In the case of Klinger vs. Conan Doyle Estate Ltd., the court ruled that the Holmes and Watson characters as described in the story elements that stem from most of the stories those published before 1924 are in the public domain.  Literary significance and reception Although some of the stories are comparable with Doyle's earlier work, this collection is often considered a lesser entry in the Sherlock Holmes canon. Kyle Freeman, author of the introduction to The Complete Sherlock Holmes, also suggests that The Mazarin Stone and The Three Gables may not be Conan Doyle's work, stating that a lmost nothing about either of The Mazarin Stone or The Three Gables has the true ring of Conan Doyle's style about them. Two authors who have written novels using Sherlock Holmes as a character, British writer David Stuart Davies and American author and director Nicholas Meyer have criticized stories from this collection. Davies has commented that The Adventure of the Creeping Man veers towards risible science fiction . In his 1974 novel The Seven Per Cent Solution, Meyer's Watson claims that this entry, as well as three others from the Case Book , are forged drivel . David Timson noted the new era of the 1920s in an introduction to The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes: It seems amazing therefore that a new series of Sherlock Holmes stories should have appeared as late as the 1920s. But despite the 1920s being the age of jazz and the flapper, where such items as telephones, electric light, electric bells, motor cars, and gramophones were becoming commonplace, the Holmes phenomenon showed no signs of diminishing. The stories, despite being set for the most part in the early 1900s, were still as eagerly read as ever. Indeed, modern technology was encouraging Holmes's popularity. By 1921 the developing silent film industry already had 15 Sherlock Holmes adaptations on its shelves, including a full length Hound of the Baskervilles. Between 1921 and 1927 Conan Doyle once again returned to his great creation for 12 more stories which were first published in The Strand, and then published collectively as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes in 1927. Recognizing that some reviewers have found the short stories in this collection as not like Conan Doyle's style, Timson suggests that In these stories, Conan Doyle seems to be struggling to find a new narrative style. Nine are related by Watson as the reader would expect, but one is narrated in the third person, and two by Holmes himself. Watson is at pains in the opening narrative to Thor Bridge to explain the change: 'In some cases I was myself concerned and can speak as an eye witness, while in others I was either not present or played so small a part that they could only be told as by a third person.' ... Conan Doyle s struggle to ring the changes on what had become for him a tired formula reflected his personal literary journey: he was reluctant to write fiction at all by the 1920s in view of his commitment to spiritualism. Three stories of the collection are not narrated by Dr Watson, unlike most Sherlock Holmes stories. The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone is narrated in the third person, since it was adapted from a stage play in which Watson hardly appeared. The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier and The Adventure of the Lion's Mane are both narrated by Holmes himself, the latter being set after his retirement.  Adaptations Some series have featured adaptations of all the stories in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, including the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and the later radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes . All but two of the stories in the collection were dramatised for radio as part of the BBC Sherlock Holmes 1952 1969 radio series. The stories in the collection, except The Blanched Soldier , The Lion's Mane , and The Retired Colourman , were adapted into episodes of the Granada television series . The Mazarin Stone and The Three Garridebs were combined for one episode, and elements of The Veiled Lodger were incorporated into the Granada adaptation of The Noble Bachelor . The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 1995 as part of the Sherlock Holmes 1989 1998 radio series. All the stories in the collection were adapted as episodes of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes . Other adaptations of stories within the collection have also been produced.

            "text": "A Scandal in Bohemia is the first short story, and the third overall work, featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. It is the first of the 56 Holmes short stories written by Doyle and the first of 38 Sherlock Holmes works illustrated by Sidney Paget. The story is notable for introducing the character of Irene Adler, who is one of the most notable female characters in the Sherlock Holmes series, despite appearing in only one story. Doyle ranked A Scandal in Bohemia fifth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories. A Scandal in Bohemia was first published on 25 June 1891 in the July issue of The Strand Magazine, and was the first of the stories collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 1892.  Plot summary On 20 March 1888, Dr. Watson is visiting Sherlock Holmes when a masked gentleman arrives at 221B Baker Street. Initially introducing himself as Count von Kramm, he reveals himself as Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia, after Holmes deduces his true identity. The King explains that, five years earlier, he engaged in a secret relationship with American opera singer Irene Adler, who has since retired and now lives in London. He is set to marry a young Scandinavian princess but worries that her strictly principled family will call the marriage off should they learn of this impropriety. The King further explains that he seeks to regain a photograph of Adler and himself together which he gave to her as a token. His agents have failed to recover the photograph through various means, and an offer to pay for it was also refused. With Adler now threatening to send the photograph to his fianc e's family, the King requests Holmes and Watson's help in recovering it. The next morning, a disguised Holmes goes to Adler's house. He discovers Adler has a gentleman friend, barrister Godfrey Norton, who calls at least once a day. On this particular day, Norton visits Adler and soon afterward takes a cab to a nearby church. Minutes later, the lady herself gets into her landau, bound for the same place. Holmes follows in a cab and enters the church, where he is unexpectedly asked to be a witness to Norton and Adler's wedding. Curiously, the newly weds go their separate ways after the ceremony. Returning to Baker Street, Holmes recounts his tale to Watson and expresses his amusement at his role in Adler's wedding. He also asks whether or not Watson is willing to participate in an illegal scheme to figure out where the picture is hidden in Adler's house. Watson agrees, and Holmes changes into another disguise as a clergyman. They depart Baker Street for Adler's house. When Holmes and Watson arrive, a group of jobless men meanders throughout the street. When Adler's coach pulls up, Holmes enacts his plan. A fight breaks out between the men on the street over who gets to help Adler. Holmes rushes into the fight to protect Adler and is seemingly struck and injured, though it is later revealed that this is a self inflicted splatter of red paint. Adler takes him into her sitting room, where Holmes motions for her to have the window opened. As Holmes lifts his hand, Watson recognizes a pre arranged signal and tosses in a plumber's smoke rocket. While smoke billows out of the building, Watson shouts Fire! and the cry is echoed up and down the street. Holmes slips out of Adler's house and tells Watson what he saw. As Holmes expected, Adler rushed to get her most precious possession at the cry of fire the photograph of herself and the King. Holmes observes that the picture was kept in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull. He was unable to steal it at that moment, however, because the coachman was watching him. The following morning, Holmes explains his findings to the King. When Holmes, Watson, and the King arrive at Adler's house at 8 am, her elderly maidservant sardonically informs them she had left the country via train earlier that morning. Holmes quickly goes to the photograph's hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter addressed to him, dated at midnight. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes he did very well in finding the photograph and taking her in with his disguises. Adler has left England with Norton, a better man than the King, adding she will not compromise the King, despite being cruelly wronged by him; she had kept the photo only to protect herself from further action he might take. Thanking Holmes effusively, the King offers a valuable emerald ring from his finger as a further reward. Holmes declines and says there is something he values even more highly: the photograph of Adler, which he keeps as a reminder of her cleverness. Watson concludes the story by noting that, since their meeting, Holmes always referred to Adler by the honourable title of the woman. In the short story's opening paragraph, Watson calls her the late Irene Adler, suggesting she is deceased. However, it has been speculated that the word late might actually mean former. She married Godfrey Norton, making Adler her former name.  Holmes' relationship to Adler Adler earns Holmes' unbounded admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level? Holmes replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King, implying that she was superior to the King all along.The beginning of A Scandal in Bohemia describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler: To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. This memory is kept alive by a photograph of Irene Adler, which had been deliberately left behind when she and her new husband took flight with the embarrassing photograph of her with the King. Holmes had then asked for and received this photo from the King, as payment for his work on the case. In The Five Orange Pips he comments to a client that he has been defeated on a mere handful of occasions and only once by a woman.In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle's novels where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his Sherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes Adler connection.  Publication history  A Scandal in Bohemia was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in July 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in August 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Stage  William Gillette's 1899 stage play Sherlock Holmes is based on several stories, among them A Scandal in Bohemia . Films released in 1916 and 1922 , both titled Sherlock Holmes, were based on the play, as was a 1938 Mercury Theatre on the Air radio adaptation titled The Immortal Sherlock Holmes, starring Orson Welles as Holmes.The 1965 Broadway musical Baker Street was loosely based on the story, making Irene Adler into the heroine and adding Professor Moriarty as the villain.Steven Dietz's 2006 play Sherlock Holmes: The Final Adventure, adapted from the 1899 play Sherlock Holmes, merges the storylines of A Scandal in Bohemia and The Final Problem. In this adaptation, Godfrey Norton is under the employ of Professor Moriarty and whose original plan was to rob Adler. However, they ended up falling in love, complicating the plan and forcing Moriarty to intervene when Holmes begins investigating on behalf of the King.  Film  The story was adapted as a 1921 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.The 1946 film Dressed to Kill, starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson, features several references to A Scandal in Bohemia , with Holmes and Watson discussing the recent publication of the story in The Strand Magazine , and the villain of the film using the same trick on Watson that Holmes uses on Irene Adler in the story.The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, a 1975 Gene Wilder film, parodies the basic storyline, with the female lead replaced with a music hall singer. The 1998 film Zero Effect is loosely based on the story, set in late 90s America, with Bill Pullman as Daryl Zero and Ben Stiller as Steve Arlo, both based on the Holmes and Watson characters, respectively. Kim Dickens plays Gloria Sullivan, the Irene Adler character, while Ryan O'Neal is Gregory Stark, the King of Bohemia equivalent.  Radio  The second episode of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes featured an adaptation by Edith Meiser of the story on 27 October 1930 and starred Clive Brook as Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Watson. A remake of the script aired in March 1933, with Richard Gordon playing Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell again playing Dr. Watson. Another remake of the script aired in August 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, who played Holmes and Watson in the film Dressed to Kill and other films, did the story for their radio series, The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 10 December 1945, and was followed by a sequel, Second Generation , featuring Irene's daughter hiring Holmes in retirement. Second Generation aired on 17 December 1945.A radio adaptation starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired in October 1954 on the BBC Light Programme.

It starred Vasily Livanov as Sherlock Holmes, Vitaly Solomin as Dr. Watson, Georgiy Martirosyan as the King of Bohemia and Larisa Solovyova as Irene Adler. A Scandal in Bohemia was adapted as the first episode of the 1984 1985 television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode featured Jeremy Brett as Holmes, David Burke as Watson, and Gayle Hunnicutt as Irene Adler, whose first name is pronounced Irena in this adaptation. A Scandal in Bohemia was featured in a season 1 episode of the PBS series Wishbone, entitled A Dogged Expos . In the episode, the supporting human characters search for an incognito photographer at their school who has been publishing embarrassing photographs of students. Intermingled with the plot, the title character Wishbone portrays Sherlock Holmes in a slightly modified adaptation of the original story to compare with the events of the real life plot. A series of four television movies produced in the early 2000s starred Matt Frewer as Sherlock Holmes and Kenneth Welsh as Dr. Watson. One of these films, The Royal Scandal, adapted A Scandal in Bohemia and combined its story with The Bruce Partington Plans . A Scandal in Belgravia , episode one of the second series of the TV series Sherlock, was loosely adapted from the short story and aired on 1 January 2012, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes, Martin Freeman as Watson and Lara Pulver as Irene Adler. The plot of the short story Holmes and Watson attempting to recover incriminating photos from Adler is covered briefly in the first half of the episode updated for the contemporary period and adjusted ; the episode then moves on to a storyline based on other Sherlock Holmes stories and films while including Adler, Mycroft Holmes and Jim Moriarty. A Scandal in Bohemia was adapted to the second episode The Adventure of the Headmaster with Trouble of NHK puppetry Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is a pupil of an imaginary boarding school Beeton School. One day he pretends to be ill and goes to the nurse's office to search the photo that Headmaster Ormstein and school nurse Irene Adler are in. But Adler sees through his feigned illness. Then Holmes and his roommate John H. Watson make a false fire to find the photo but she penetrates their wiles and tells Holmes that she returned the photo to Ormstein. The hereditary king makes an appearance in a season six episode of Elementary entitled Breathe.  Fictional monarchies Rather than creating a fictional country for the King in his story, Conan Doyle chose to place a fictional dynasty in a real country. The Kingdom of Bohemia was at the time of writing a possession of the House of Habsburg and the Austrian Emperors held the title King of Bohemia . Although Bohemian nobles had offered the crown to other Germanic families twice since the Middle Ages , claiming the title formally had elective succession. On the other hand, there had never been a Kingdom of Scandinavia . The closest instance was the personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden under the Kalmar Union, which was never formalised like the British Acts of Union and broke down in the 16th century. However after the Kalmar Union was dissolved by Gustav Vasa's coronation the Kingdom of Norway remained in personal union with Denmark before the Napoleonic Wars changed that to a union with Sweden, which existed until 14 years after publication and this might have been the Kingdom of Scandinavia Conan Doyle meant. The surname of the King's fianc e was that of the actual ruling house of the Duchy of Saxe Meiningen. At publication ruled by George II, Duke of Saxe Meiningen, a cadet member of the Ernestine duchies ruled by various cousins from the House of Wettin, whose Saxe Coburg line produced Queen Victoria's mother Victoria and husband Albert. There was also no Grand Duchy of Cassel Felstein and in fact there was no major title with the name Felstein. The closest match is a collective municipality named Feldstein. But there was a possible inspiration in the former Landgraviate of Hesse, which was partitioned into four parts in the 16th century. While two went extinct swiftly and were divided by the remaining pair, both of those probably inspired the title. One was the Landgraviate of Hesse Kassel, which was spelled with Cassel before the 20th century spelling reform of German changed the city's name. This title was elevated to the Electorate of Hesse during the Napoleonic Wars, but by the time of publication had been annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia for 25 years as the Province of Hesse Nassau. The Landgraviate of Hesse Darmstadt also has a probable connection to the fictional title, since it was elevated to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1806. At the time of publication its ruler was Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, whose first wife had been Queen Victoria's third child Princess Alice of the United Kingdom.

            "text": "The Red Headed League is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It first appeared in The Strand Magazine in August 1891, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. Conan Doyle ranked The Red Headed League second in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories. It is also the second of the twelve stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in 1892.  Plot  Jabez Wilson, a London pawnbroker, comes to consult Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson on a Saturday. While studying this prospective client, both Holmes and Watson notice his red hair, which has a distinct flame like hue. Wilson tells them that some weeks before, his young assistant, Vincent Spaulding, urged him to respond to a newspaper advertisement by The Red Headed League offering highly paid work to only red headed male applicants. The next morning, Wilson had waited in a long line of fellow red headed men, was interviewed, and was the only applicant hired because none of the others had hair colour to match his. Wilson was grateful to secure the position, as his pawnshop was struggling. He was required to occupy an office from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. every day and copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica, for which he was paid 4 per week . The work was useless clerical labour, performed in nominal compliance with the will of an American millionaire who wanted to provide for the welfare of red headed men like himself. After eight weeks, Wilson reported to the office only to find a note on the door stating that the Red Headed League had been dissolved. He spoke with the landlord, who stated that he had never heard of either the organisation or of Duncan Ross, the person who had hired Wilson for the position. The landlord did remember a tenant with scarlet hair, who had given his name as William Morris and presented a business card for an artificial kneecap company, but no one there knew of either Ross or Morris. He decided to bring his problem to Holmes immediately afterward. Holmes and Watson laugh at Wilson's frustration over losing the job; Holmes points out that Wilson has earned a considerable sum of money, but promises to solve the case quickly. Wilson provides a description of Spaulding, after which Holmes and Watson visit the pawnshop. Holmes strikes the pavement in front with his walking stick and focuses on the knees of Spaulding's trousers when he answers the door. Concluding that a crime is about to be committed at a bank near the shop, Holmes gathers Watson, Inspector Jones of Scotland Yard, and bank chairman Mr. Merryweather that night. As the four hide in the darkened bank vault, Merryweather reveals that it holds a shipment of gold coins borrowed from a French bank; Holmes suspects a wanted criminal named John Clay of planning to steal them. After more than an hour's wait, Clay and his red headed accomplice Archie break upward through the vault floor inadvertently found to be hollow by Merryweather earlier. Clay is quickly captured while Archie escapes, but Holmes leaves the latter man to be caught by the additional police officers Jones has stationed around Wilson's shop. Back at Baker Street, Holmes explains his reasoning to Watson. Archie and Spaulding, whom Holmes had recognised as Clay from Wilson's description, concocted the Red Headed League as a way to keep Wilson occupied during the day so that Clay could tunnel into the bank vault from the cellar of the shop. Holmes had noticed that Clay's trouser knees were worn and dirty from digging, and striking the pavement had informed him that the cellar extended behind the shop and toward the bank. Archie had posed as Morris to rent the office, then as Ross to hire Wilson, and closed the office once the tunnel was completed.  Analysis The dates given in the story do not match the characters' descriptions of time passing. The date that Wilson sees the advertisement is 27 April 1890 and he has been at work for 8 weeks and says Just two months ago. Thus that happened by the end of June. However, the story begins by describing Holmes's meeting with Wilson as being on one day in the autumn of last year and the date on the door telling of the League being dissolved is that of 9 October 1890, six months after the ad was placed. Dorothy L. Sayers analyzed this discrepancy and claims that the dates must have been 4 August and 4 October respectively.  Publication history  The Red Headed League was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in August 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in September 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Film and television  A 1921 short film was adapted from the story as part of the Stoll film series featuring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of Sherlock Holmes starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes.The first American television adaptation of the story was in the 1954 1955 television series Sherlock Holmes starring Ronald Howard. An adaptation of The Red Headed League was used for an episode of the 1965 television series Sherlock Holmes starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson, with Toke Townley as Jabez Wilson.In the 1985 television adaptation starring Jeremy Brett, the scheme was masterminded by Professor Moriarty and Clay is Moriarty's star pupil of crime . An episode of the animated 1999 2001 television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century titled The Red Headed League was based on the story.In the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, Jabez Wilson is a pupil of Beeton School as well as Holmes and Watson and is invited to the Red Headed Club by his senior Duncan Ross. But strangely enough, what he does in the club is painting balls, stones and bottles red. Holmes suspects that it is a means for Ross to ensure Wilson stays away from a certain place.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as the third episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which aired on 5 January 1931, starring Clive Brook as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 24 May 1933 and 8 February 1936 .Edith Meiser also adapted the story for the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 27 October 1940. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 28 May 1943, and on 2 June 1947 . The story was also read by Basil Rathbone in a 1966 recording released by Caedmon Records. A radio adaptation starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson aired on the BBC Home Service in 1953, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series. Hobbs and Shelley also played Holmes and Watson respectively in a 1957 radio adaptation on the BBC Home Service, and a 1964 radio adaptation on the BBC Light Programme.John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of The Red Headed League which aired on 19 October 1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The production also aired in January 1955 on NBC radio and in May 1956 on ABC radio.A radio adaptation aired on 26 April 1977, on the series CBS Radio Mystery Theater. Kevin McCarthy was the voice of Holmes.An adaptation aired on BBC radio in June 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell. The Red Headed League was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 by Vincent McInerney as an episode of the 1989 1998 radio series, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It also featured James Wilby as Vincent Spaulding.A 2014 episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was adapted from the story, and starred John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Stage  The story, along with The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax , The Adventure of the Empty House , and The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton , provided the source material for the play The Return of Sherlock Holmes.  Video games  Multiple references to the story are made in the two The Great Ace Attorney games. In the first game, The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures, Herlock Sholmes incorrectly deduces that one of the involved parties in the final case was trying to dig a tunnel into a bank from a pawnshop, which is quickly disproven by protagonist Ryunosuke Naruhodo. In the second game, The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve, Sholmes is fooled by a fraudulent advertisement from the Red Headed League and drinks a potion that turns his hair red before being scammed out of five shillings. Sholmes later has the two leaders of the league arrested, and their testimony about the scam proves important in revealing the truth of the international conspiracy at the heart of the game's plot. In addition, the name John Clay is briefly mentioned in another case, though as the name of a policeman rather than a criminal, and a character is named Duncan Ross, although he is seemingly unrelated to the Red Headed League.

            "text": "A Case of Identity is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is the third story in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It first appeared in The Strand Magazine in September 1891.  Plot summary The story revolves around the case of Miss Mary Sutherland, a woman with a substantial income from the interest on a fund set up for her. She is engaged to a quiet Londoner who has recently disappeared. Sherlock Holmes' detective powers are barely challenged as this turns out to be quite an elementary case for him, much as it puzzles Watson. The fianc , Hosmer Angel, is a peculiar character, rather quiet, and rather secretive about his life. Miss Sutherland only knows that he works in an office in Leadenhall Street, but nothing more specific than that. All his letters to her are typewritten, even the signature, and he insists that she write back to him through the local Post Office. The climax of the sad liaison comes when Mr. Angel abandons Miss Sutherland at the altar on their wedding day. Holmes, noting all these things, Hosmer Angel's description, and the fact that he only seems to meet with Miss Sutherland while her disapproving youngish stepfather, James Windibank, is out of the country on business, reaches a conclusion quite quickly. A typewritten letter confirms his belief beyond doubt. Only one person could have gained by this: Mr. James Windibank. Holmes deduces Angel had disappeared by simply going out the other side of a four wheeler cab. After solving the mystery, Holmes chooses not to tell his client the solution, since If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world. Holmes had earlier advised his client to forget Mr. Angel , but Miss Sutherland refused to take Holmes' advice and vowed to remain faithful to Angel until he reappears for at least ten years. Holmes predicts Windibank will continue a career in crime and end up on the gallows.  Publication history  A Case of Identity was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in October 1891. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Film and television  This story was the basis for the third Holmes adventure in the silent Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood.In 2001, this was the basis for the last episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century.In 2014, it is seen in The Empty Hearse , from the BBC television series Sherlock, as one of the cases Sherlock works on with Molly Hooper assisting him. Mary Sutherland was portrayed by Elizabeth Coyle. Molly Hooper was portrayed by Louise Brealey. In the fourth episode of the 2014 Japanese puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, Mary Sutherland is a pupil of Beeton School. She is in love with the senior Hosmer Angel who suddenly disappears in a cave at the back of the school. Holmes, a pupil who lives in room 221B of Baker Dormitory, suspects that Angel and Windibank, one of the childhood friends of Sutherland, are the same person and he and Watson find out that there is no pupil called Hosmer Angel in the school. Holmes appreciates Watson for consoling the broken hearted Sutherland. Watson tells Holmes, who criticises novels as in the original story, that he is wrong to do so because various things can be learned from novels including how to understand the female mind.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which aired on 5 May 1932, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 21 April 1935 .Edith Meiser also adapted the story for the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 30 November 1941. Another adaptation of the story aired in the same series on 30 May 1948 .John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Dr. Watson in a radio adaptation that aired on the BBC Light Programme on 2 November 1954. It was broadcast on NBC radio on 23 January 1955.A radio adaptation aired in 1969, as part of the 1952 1969 BBC radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.The story was adapted in 1990 by Peter Mackie as an episode of the 1989 1998 BBC radio series, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Susannah Corbett as Mary Sutherland.A 2014 episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Other media  Colin Dexter, known for writing the Inspector Morse novels, wrote a short story based on this called A Case of Mis Identity , in which Holmes's brother Mycroft is involved in the case's deduction; in this story, Holmes's theory about the 'Hosmer Angel' character is the same, while Mycroft deduces that 'Hosmer Angel' is a fiction created by the mother and daughter to eliminate the step father, only for Watson to reveal that 'Hosmer Angel' is actually a real person who was attacked and robbed on the way to his wedding, hospitalized, and eventually treated by Watson, who used his own detective skills to verify the man's identity.The story was adapted as the beginning of the third case in the 2016 Frogwares video game Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter. Watson is not present when Mary Sutherland arrives and Sherlock is accompanied by Orson Wilde, an American actor training to play him. The player can come up with different conclusions to the case and also make a choice concerning telling her the results of his deduction. Keith R. A. Decandido's short story, Identity: An Adventure of Shirley Holmes and Jack Watson updates the story to modern day Manhattan. Here, the explanation is changed from nearsightedness to prosopagnosia, or face blindness. Feminist activist and literary reviewer Wanda Dexter strongly criticized Holmes' conduct: There is a worldwide community of Sherlock Holmes admirers who engage in perpetual adulation of their 19th Century hero. A casual look through the so admired Holmes stories should be enough to uncover the nasty person just under the surface. Take how he treats his female client in the story A Case of Identity . What a patronizing arrogance, to decide for his client whether or not she could stand hearing the truth! Holmes was manifestly unethical to his client. She engaged him to find Hosmer Angel. He found Hosmer Angel. He should have given his client the information she wanted and let her decide what to do with it. And presumably he did not work for free. So he had no shame, taking her money and failing to give value for it! . Anyway, what is this nonsense about the villain being beyond reach of the law? In British law of that time, a man could be sued for breach of promise. Even a bachelor who proposed to a woman with complete sincerity and then changed his mind could be sued. All the more so a married man who went through an elaborate charade and fallaciously courted his own daughter in law! Any half decent lawyer could have broken him in court, as he so richly deserved. Instead, Holmes lets her live on, unsuspecting, pining for her lost love, under the tutelage of her criminal father in law, who might hatch a dozen new nefarious schemes! In effect, she is the victim of a de facto alliance between two men the father in law who victimized her, and the detective who utterly failed to warn her against him.

            "text": "The Boscombe Valley Mystery , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the fourth of the twelve stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in the Strand Magazine in 1891.  Plot summary Lestrade summons Holmes to a community in Herefordshire, where a local landowner has been murdered outdoors. The deceased's estranged son is strongly implicated. Holmes quickly determines that a mysterious third man may be responsible for the crime, unravelling a thread involving a secret criminal past, thwarted love and blackmail. Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson take a train to Boscombe Valley, in Herefordshire. En route, Holmes reads the news and briefs Watson on their new case. John Turner, a widower and a major landowner who has a daughter named Alice, lives there with a fellow expatriate from Australia, Charles McCarthy, a widower who has a son named James. Charles has been found dead near Boscombe Pool; it was reported that he was there to meet someone. Two witnesses testify that they saw Charles walking into the woods followed by James, who was carrying a gun. Patience Moran, daughter of a lodgekeeper, says that she saw Charles and James arguing and that, when James raised his hand as if to hit his father, she ran to her mother, and while she was telling her mother what she saw James rushed to their house seeking help. The Morans followed James back to the Pool, where they found his father dead. James was arrested and charged with murder. Alice Turner believes that James is innocent and has contacted Lestrade, a Scotland Yard detective who in turn has asked Holmes' help. James confirms the testimonies of the witnesses, but explains that he was going into the woods to hunt, not to follow his father. He later heard his father calling Cooee and found his father standing by the pool, surprised to see him. They argued heatedly, and James decided to return to Hatherley Farm. Shortly after that he heard his father cry out, and returned to find his father lying on the ground. James insists that he tried to help him, but his father died in his arms. James refuses to give the cause of their argument, despite the coroner's warning that it could be damaging to his case if he does not reveal it. James also remembers that his father's last words were something about a rat , but James is uncertain of their meaning in the situation. He also thinks he saw a cloak on the ground, which vanished while he was helping his father. Alice meets Holmes, Watson and Lestrade in the hotel, and she hopes that Holmes has found a way to prove James's innocence. She also believes that she was the subject of the argument between the McCarthys Charles wanted his son to marry her, but James had refused. Alice had taken James's side out of respect for him, and her father was also against the union. Holmes asks Alice if he could meet her father, but she says his health worsened after the death of Charles, whom he had known since they were in Victoria. Holmes decides to see James. Holmes mistakenly surmises that James knows who killed his father and is protecting someone. It emerges that Alice is right about the cause of the argument between James and Charles. What she does not know is that James actually loves her, but could not follow his father's demand because he had married a barmaid before Alice had returned from boarding school. This burdened him, but he could not tell his father about his marriage because he would have been kicked out of the house and left unable to support himself. When his wife heard of his troubles, however, she confessed that she was already married before they met, and therefore their marriage is invalid. Holmes, Watson and Lestrade go to Hatherley Farm, and examine Charles's and James's boots. They then head to Boscombe Pool, following the track from the courtyard. After examining the ground, Holmes finds evidence of the presence of another man, besides Charles and James, whom he believes to be the murderer. Holmes deduces that the killer is left handed , and that the stranger is tall, has a limp and smokes cigars. Lestrade is not convinced. At the hotel Holmes explains to Watson that Cooee is an Australian cry and that the apparent reference to a rat , overheard by James, in fact comprised the last syllables of Ballarat , a place in Australia. The person Charles was meeting was, therefore, someone he knew from Australia. John Turner, Alice's father, then comes to their room , entering with a limp, and, realising that Holmes has deduced the crime, confesses. In his confession, John explains that he was a member of the Ballarat Gang, a group of bushrangers in Australia. They robbed a gold convoy in which Charles was the wagon driver, and John spared his life, despite knowing that Charles could later identify him. The loot made the surviving gang members rich, and they moved to England. Resolved to change, John parted ways with his friends. He bought land and got married, and then Alice was born. Some time later, Charles tracked down John and threatened to blackmail him unless he and his son were provided for. In response, John gave Charles Hatherley Farm and money, hoping this would satisfy him. However, this was not enough, and Charles eventually demanded the marriage of James and Alice. Although he liked James, John did not want Charles' cursed blood mixed with his family's, so he resisted the union. After much pressure, John agreed to meet Charles secretly at the Pool to resolve the matter. Seeing Charles and James there arguing, John hid, intending to wait until James left. However, he became angry when he heard the nature of the argument, and killed Charles to preserve his freedom and spare his daughter. James heard his father's death cry and returned, but John was able to hide in the woods. He had to return later to retrieve the cloak that he had dropped in his haste. John signs his statement, and Holmes vows to keep it secret unless it is needed to free James. In the end, Holmes's objections are sufficient to acquit James, and John dies seven months after the meeting with Holmes and Watson. Meanwhile, Watson surmises that James and Alice will likely marry and live in happiness without ever discovering the true history of their fathers.  Possible basis for Boscombe Valley En route to the murder scene Holmes tells Watson that Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. There is no real location matching this description. Leslie S. Klinger, in his The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, calls it a disguised name and lists possible locations for the setting of the story as posited by other researchers.  Publication history  The Boscombe Valley Mystery was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in November 1891. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Film and television  One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes clair film series was based on the story. In the short film, Georges Tr ville played Sherlock Holmes and Mr Moyse played Dr. Watson. Another short film based on the story was released in 1922 as part of the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.The 1968 television series Sherlock Holmes, starring Peter Cushing as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson, dramatised this story for its sixth episode. Lestrade is replaced by a local policeman, Inspector Lanner, and Charles McCarthy's first name has been changed to Bill. John Turner dies immediately after confessing to Holmes. In the 1991 TV adaption starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, Boscombe Valley is in Cheshire in the northwest of England. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard does not appear; instead Holmes cooperates with one Inspector Summerby. A young James Purefoy stars as James McCarthy.  Radio  The Boscombe Valley Mystery was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Meiser also adapted the story for The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for a 1940 episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.In 1943, the BBC Home Service dramatised the story with Arthur Wontner as Holmes and Carleton Hobbs as Watson. A different radio adaptation aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1966, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Boscombe Valley Mystery was adapted as an episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater titled The Boscombe Pool Mystery . The episode, which featured Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in May 1977. The Boscombe Valley Mystery was adapted in 1990 for BBC Radio 4 by Bert Coules, as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It also featured Samuel West as James McCarthy and Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade.A 2011 episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

            "text": "The Five Orange Pips , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the fifth of the twelve stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in November 1891. Conan Doyle later ranked the story seventh in a list of his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. This is also one of only two Sherlock Holmes short stories where Holmes' client dies after seeking his help; the other being The Adventure of the Dancing Men .  Plot A young gentleman named John Openshaw visits Holmes one night with a strange story. His uncle Elias had emigrated to the United States as a young man, establishing himself as a planter in Florida and joining the Confederate States Army, in which he rose to the rank of colonel. In 1869 or 1870, he returned to England and purchased an estate near Horsham in Sussex, adopting a reclusive lifestyle. He later allowed John to live on the estate and gave him full access to the property, except for one storage room that was always kept locked. On 10 March 1883, Elias received a letter postmarked Pondicherry, bearing the inscription K.K.K. and containing only five orange pips . The arrival of this letter badly unnerved Elias, and he sent John to bring a lawyer to the estate. By the time John returned, Elias had retrieved a box marked K.K.K. from the locked room and burned its contents. Elias made a will naming his brother Joseph as his heir, with the intent that John should eventually inherit the estate from him. Elias's already reclusive behaviour became even more bizarre; he would either lock himself in his room and drink heavily, or rush about the grounds in a frenzy while carrying a pistol. On 2 May 1883, seven weeks after receiving the letter, he was found dead in a garden pool. The death was ruled a suicide, but John did not believe that Elias could have killed himself. Joseph took possession of the estate and examined the room, finding scattered records of Elias's time in the United States. On 4 January 1885, he received a letter postmarked Dundee, identical to the one received by Elias and containing instructions to put the papers on the sundial in the garden. John realised that the papers being demanded must have been the ones burned by Elias. Despite John's urging, Joseph decided not to involve the police. Three days later, he was found dead at the bottom of a chalk pit; the death was ruled an accident, but again John had his doubts. John has now received a letter postmarked London that orders him to put the papers on the sundial, but the local police are convinced that the letters are merely practical jokes. The only clue he can provide is a page from Elias's diary, dated March 1869 and detailing that pips were sent to three men; two were later cleared and one was visited. Holmes suggests that John put the page in the box that had contained the other papers, along with a note detailing their destruction, and leave the box on the sundial. After John departs, Holmes deduces that Elias had returned to England and gone into hiding because something in the United States had prompted him to flee for his life, and that the letters were sent from a sailing ship based on their postmarks and the time lapse between the first two mailings and the recipients' deaths. He recognises K.K.K. as the Ku Klux Klan, an anti Reconstruction domestic terrorist group in the South that was active until its sudden collapse in 1869 triggered, Holmes theorises, by Elias's return to England with vital records that the other members have since been trying to recover. Opponents of the Klan would receive a warning, and would be killed unless they either fled or renounced their opposition. The next morning's newspaper carries an article on the discovery of John's body in the River Thames, apparently the result of an accidental drowning after falling off the Waterloo Bridge. Now convinced that all three Openshaw men were murdered, Holmes spends the day checking the records of sailing ships and finds only one that could have been in Pondicherry, Dundee, and London when the letters were mailed an American barque, the Lone Star. He puts five orange pips into an envelope with the note S.H. for J.O. , addresses it to the captain, and mails it to the vessel's home port of Savannah, Georgia. He also sends a telegram to the Savannah police, informing them that the captain and mates the only American crewmen are wanted in England for murder. Holmes' desire for vengeance ultimately goes unfulfilled, as the Lone Star is destroyed in a severe gale. No trace is ever found except for a broken sternpost marked L.S. , seen floating on the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.  Note At the time of writing, the actual Ku Klux Klan was indeed broken and effectively defunct, and it would be decades before its 20th century revival. Conan Doyle's taking it up in this story was in line with his recurrent theme of wild and violent Americans and other foreigners exporting their power struggles to Victorian Britain which already formed the basis to A Study in Scarlet, the very first Holmes mystery.  Publication history  The Five Orange Pips was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in November 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in December 1891. The story was published with six illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which aired on 9 March 1931, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 5 September 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 1 February 1942.A radio adaptation aired on the BBC Home Service in 1952, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Felix Felton. Other adaptations of the story in the same series aired on the BBC Home Service in 1957 and on the BBC Light Programme in 1966 . The Five Orange Pips was dramatised by Vincent McInerney for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.A 2007 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Film and television  The 1945 film Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear is partly based on The Five Orange Pips . An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled The Five Orange Pips , aired in 2000.The third episode of the 2010 BBC Sherlock series titled The Great Game made reference to five pips being sent by an assassin organization as a warning. In the episode, these pips were five electronic beeps, like the pips broadcast on the hour by the BBC's analogue radio stations. The Sherlock 2016 Special The Abominable Bride also refers to the original short story, as a murder victim is mailed five orange pips as a threat before being killed. There is also a secret organisation similar to the KKK only in its hooded costumes related to the case in the episode. The November 2014 episode of Elementary titled The Five Orange Pipz takes some story elements from this short story. The unusual Pipz spelling is the trademarked name of a fictional bead toy where a manufacturing error rendered the orange beads poisonous when ingested by children.

            "text": "The Man with the Twisted Lip , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the sixth of the twelve stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in the Strand Magazine in December 1891. Doyle ranked The Man with the Twisted Lip sixteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.  Plot summary The story begins when a friend of Dr. Watson's wife comes to Watson's house, frantic because her husband, who is addicted to opium, has gone missing. Watson helps her pull him out of the opium den and sends him home. Watson is surprised to find that Sherlock Holmes is there too, in disguise and trying to get information to solve a different case about a man who has disappeared. Watson stays to listen to Holmes tell the story of the case of Neville St. Clair. St. Clair is a prosperous, respectable, punctual man. His family's home is in the country, but he visits London every day on business. One day when Mr. St. Clair was in London, Mrs. St. Clair also went to London separately. She happened to pass down Upper Swandam Lane, a vile alley near the London docks, where the opium den is. Glancing up, she saw her husband at a second floor window of the opium den. He vanished from the window immediately, and Mrs. St. Clair was sure that there was something wrong. She tried to enter the building; but her way was blocked by the opium den's owner, a lascar. She fetched the police, but they did not find Mr. St. Clair. The room behind the window was the lair of a dirty, disfigured beggar, known to the police as Hugh Boone. The police were about to put her story down as a mistake of some kind when Mrs. St. Clair noticed a box of wooden toy bricks that her husband said he would buy for their son. A further search turned up some of St. Clair's clothes. Later, his coat, with the pockets stuffed with hundreds of pennies and halfpennies, was found on the bank of the River Thames, just below the building's back window. Hugh Boone was arrested at once, but would say nothing, except to deny any knowledge of St. Clair. He also resisted any attempt to make him wash. Holmes was initially quite convinced that St. Clair had been murdered, and that Boone was involved. Thus he investigated the den in disguise. He and Watson return to St. Clair's home, to a surprise. It is several days after the disappearance; but on that day Mrs. St. Clair had received a letter from her husband in his own handwriting, with his wedding ring enclosed, telling her not to worry. This forces Holmes to reconsider his conclusions, leading him eventually to an extraordinary solution. Holmes and Watson go the police station where Hugh Boone is held; Holmes brings a bath sponge in a Gladstone bag. Finding Boone asleep, Holmes washes the sleeping Boone's dirty face revealing Neville St. Clair. Mr. St. Clair has been leading a double life, as a respectable businessman, and as a beggar. In his youth, he had been an actor before becoming a newspaper reporter. In order to research an article, he had disguised himself as a beggar for a short time, and was able to collect a surprising amount of money due to a skillset uncommon to beggars; his actor's skills enabled him to emulate a more sympathetic character with make up, as well as provide a repertoire of witty dialogue with which to entertain passers by to offer coins he was as much a street performer as a beggar. Later, he was saddled with a large debt, and returned to the street to beg for several days to pay it off. His newspaper salary was meagre and, tempted by the much larger returns of begging, he eventually became a professional beggar. His takings were large enough that he was able to establish himself as a country gentleman, marry well, and begin a respectable family. His wife and children never knew what he did for a living, and when arrested, he feared exposure more than prison or the gallows. But there is no murder, so he is released, and Holmes and the police agree to keep Mr. St. Clair's secret as long as no more is heard of Hugh Boone.  Points of interest The ability of St. Clair to earn a good living begging is considered by some to be an unlikely event, but others disagree.Doyle may have got the idea of a professional man making his money from begging from a short story by William Makepeace Thackeray called Miss Shum's Husband .The morning the mystery is solved Watson awakes about 4:25 a.m., yet the summer sun is said to shine brightly already. In one in universe point of interest, Watson's wife Mary calls him by the name James despite his established first name being John . This led Dorothy L. Sayers to speculate that Mary may be using his middle name Hamish , though Doyle himself never addresses this beyond including the initial.  Publication history  The Man with the Twisted Lip was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in January 1892. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.

The adaptation developed St Clair's attributed ability at repartee by showing him quoting from the classics, including Shakespeare. Granada Television also produced a version in 1986, adapted by Alan Plater as part of their The Return of Sherlock Holmes television series, starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, with Denis Lill as Inspector Bradstreet, Clive Francis as Neville St. Clair, and Albert Moses as the Lascar.An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was adapted from the story. The episode, titled The Man with the Twisted Lip , aired in 2000.The 2014 Sherlock episode His Last Vow begins with Sherlock being found in a drug den by John, reminiscent of the scene in the opium den from this story.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle is one of 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the seventh story of twelve in the collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in January 1892.  Plot As London prepares for Christmas, newspapers report the theft of a near priceless gemstone, the Blue Carbuncle , from the hotel suite of the Countess of Morcar. The police arrest John Horner, a plumber with a criminal record who was in Countess's room repairing a fireplace. In Baker Street, Watson finds Holmes contemplating a battered old hat brought to him by Peterson, a commissionaire, who seeks Holmes's help in returning the hat to its rightful owner, along with a Christmas goose. Both had been dropped in the street during a scuffle. Although the goose bears a tag with the name Henry Baker, there is little hope of finding an owner with such a common name. Peterson takes the goose home for dinner, and Holmes keeps the hat to study as an intellectual exercise. Peterson returns excited, carrying the stolen gem, and reports that he found it in the goose's crop. Holmes closely studies the hat and its condition, deducing Henry Baker's age, social standing, intellect, and domestic status. When Baker appears in response to advertisements that Holmes places in the London newspapers, Holmes offers him a new goose. Happily accepting the replacement bird, Baker declines to take away the original bird's entrails, convincing Holmes that he knew nothing about the gem. He tells Holmes that he had purchased the goose at the Alpha Inn, a pub near the British Museum. Holmes and Watson visit the pub, where the proprietor informs them that the bird was purchased from a Covent Garden dealer. The dealer there refuses to help, complaining of the pestering he has endured recently about geese purchased by the Alpha Inn. Holmes, realising that he is not the only one aware of the goose's importance, tricks the irate man into revealing that the bird was supplied to him by its breeder, Mrs Oakshott of Brixton. A trip to Brixton proves unnecessary when the dealer's other pesterer appears James Ryder, head attendant at the hotel where the gem was stolen. Back in Baker Street, Ryder admits that he and his accomplice, the Countess's maid, had contrived to frame Horner, believing that his criminal past would make him an easy scapegoat. During a visit to his sister Mrs Oakshott Ryder had hit on the idea of feeding the gem to a goose she had promised him as a gift. Unfortunately, Ryder then took away the wrong bird, confusing his goose with another in the flock. By the time he realised his mistake, the other had already been sold. Ryder sobs convulsively. Holmes takes pity on the man and allows him to flee, having concluded that he has been far too frightened by the episode to offend again. Also, it was the season of forgiveness. Horner can expect to be freed as the case against him must now collapse.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Speckled Band is one of 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the eighth story of twelve in the collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was originally published in Strand Magazine in February 1892. The Speckled Band is a classic locked room mystery that deals with the themes of parental greed, inheritance and freedom. Tinged with Gothic elements, it is considered by many to be one of Doyle's finest works, with the author himself calling it his best story. The story, alongside the rest of the Sherlock Holmes canon, has become a defining part of detective fiction. It has been adapted for television, film, theatre, radio, and a video game. It is also part of the exhibit at the Sherlock Holmes Museum. The theatrical adaptation was written and produced by Doyle himself, directed by and starring Lyn Harding as Grimesby Roylott. The role of Sherlock Holmes was played by H. A. Saintsbury. Doyle famously clashed with Harding over several details of the script, but later reconciled with him after the universal success of the play.  Plot summary Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson rise early one morning to meet a young woman named Helen Stoner who fears that her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, is threatening her life. Roylott is a doctor who practised in Calcutta, India, and was married to Helen's late mother when she was a widow living there. He is also the impoverished last survivor of what was once a wealthy but violent, ill tempered and amoral Anglo Saxon aristocratic family of Surrey, and has already served a jail sentence for killing his Indian butler in a rage. Helen's twin sister died almost two years earlier, shortly before she was to be married. Helen had heard her sister's dying words, The speckled band! but could not decode their meaning. Helen herself is now engaged. She has begun to hear strange noises and observe strange activities around Stoke Moran, the impoverished and heavily mortgaged estate where she and her stepfather live. Dr. Roylott also keeps strange company at the estate. He is friendly with a band of Gypsies on the property, and he has a cheetah and a baboon as pets. For some time, he has been making changes to the house. Before Helen's sister's death, he had modifications made inside the house and is now having the outside wall repaired, forcing Helen to move into the room where her sister died. Holmes listens carefully to Helen's story and agrees to take the case. He plans a visit to the manor later in the day. Before he can leave, he is visited by Dr. Roylott himself, who threatens him should he interfere. Undaunted, Holmes proceeds to the courthouse, where he examines Helen's late mother's will, and then to the countryside. At Stoke Moran, Holmes scrutinizes the premises inside and out. Among the strange features that he discovers are a bed anchored to the floor, a bell cord that is not attached to any bell, and a ventilator hole between Helen's temporary room and that of Dr. Roylott. Holmes and Watson arrange to spend the night in Helen's room. In darkness, they wait until about three in the morning; suddenly, a slight metallic noise and a dim light through the ventilator prompt Holmes to action. Quickly lighting a candle, he discovers on the bell cord the speckled band a venomous snake. He strikes at the snake with his riding crop, driving it back through the ventilator. Agitated, it fatally attacks Roylott, who had been waiting for it to return after killing Helen. Holmes identifies the snake as an Indian swamp adder and reveals to Watson the motive: the late wife's will had provided an annual income of 750 sterling, of which each daughter could claim one third upon marriage. Thus, Dr. Roylott plotted to remove both of his stepdaughters before they married to avoid losing most of the fortune he controlled. Holmes admits his attack on the snake may make him indirectly responsible for Roylott's demise, but he does not foresee it troubling him.  Inspirations Richard Lancelyn Green, the editor of the 2000 Oxford paperback edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, surmises that Doyle's source for the story appears to have been the article named Called on by a Boa Constrictor. A West African Adventure in Cassell's Saturday Journal, published in February 1891. In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees a dark queer looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it . It turns out to be the largest Boa constrictor he has seen . He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick he manages to ring it and raise the alarm.  Identity of 'The Speckled Band'  It is a swamp adder! cried Holmes; the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Most people consider the snake to be a fictitious creation; however, the identity of the snake has been a subject of much debate among Sherlockians. The key characteristics to be considered in identification of the snake are: A fast acting neurotoxic venom, as opposed to the common haemotoxic venom of most snakes Ability to climb well Appearance described as a yellow band with brownish speckles , a squat, diamond shaped head, and a puffed neck An Indian originThe below candidates have been considered.

Television  A half hour television adaptation starring Alan Napier and Melville Cooper was broadcast as the tenth episode of the NBC Television series Your Show Time on 25 March 1949. This is one of the earliest known television appearances of Holmes. The pilot episode of the BBC's 1964 1965 series Sherlock Holmes was a new version of The Speckled Band , airing in May 1964 as part of the Detective anthology series. The episode was written by Giles Cooper, was directed by Robin Midgley, and starred Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson and Felix Felton as Roylott. The Speckled Band was adapted for the screen in the USSR in 1979 with Vasily Livanov as Sherlock Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Doctor Watson. The Speckled Band was the sixth episode of the first series of Holmes adaptations by Granada Television starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and David Burke as Watson, first broadcast in 1984. The Speckled Band was adapted as part of the 1984 85 anime series Sherlock Hound. In this version, Moriarty poses as Roylott to steal Helen's money, and Hound gets involved when his motorcar breaks down and must stay at their home for the night. K ki Mitani adapted The Adventure of the Speckled Band and The Creeping Man to an episode in the NHK puppetry series Sherlock Holmes. One night a swamp adder with crocus shaped speckles is found in Beeton School. On the next day, trainee teacher Helen Stoner visits Holmes and Watson in 221B of Baker Dormitory and tells them about the strange behaviour of Grimesby Roylott who teaches chemistry. That night they find out what his behaviour means but Sherman, a female pupil is attacked by the adder. The animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century featured an adaptation of the story, The Scales of Justice .  Video games  The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures adapted The Speckled Band into the game's second episode, The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band . In the episode, the protagonist, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, aids Herlock Sholmes in the investigation, the protagonist's best friend, Kazuma Asogi, takes the place as the victim, and the culprit's true identity is changed to a Russian asylum seeker who was only going by the alias of Roylott to hide her identity. In the middle of the case, Sholmes deduces the story's original conclusion. However, Ryunosuke's partner, Susato Mikotoba, points out the numerous issues regarding the biology of snakes. Thanks to Ryunosuke, it is eventually deduced that the victim's death was caused by him tripping over a cat after being shoved, and that the speckled band refers to a cat teaser toy. Later in the game's fourth episode; The Adventure of the Clouded Kokoro has Herlock's assistant, Iris Wilson, adapt the events into The Speckled Band , but changes some details around to make it more interesting to the audience such as by making the snake the murder weapon, fully aware that this wouldn't make sense considering the biology of snakes.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the ninth of the twelve stories collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in March 1892. Within the narrative of the story, Dr. Watson notes that this is one of only two cases which he personally brought to the attention of Sherlock Holmes.  Synopsis The story, set in the summer of 1889, mainly consists of a young London consultant hydraulic engineer, Mr. Victor Hatherley, recounting strange happenings of the night before, first to Dr. Watson. Hatherley had been visited in his office by a man who identified himself as Colonel Lysander Stark. He offered Hatherley a commission at a country house, in Eyford, Berkshire to examine a hydraulic press used, as Stark explains, to compress fuller's earth into bricks. Stark warned Hatherley to keep the job confidential, offering him 50 guineas . Hatherley felt compelled to take this work, despite his misgivings, as his business was newly established and he had very little work. Upon arriving late at night at the appointed train station, Hatherley is met by Colonel Stark and is driven a considerable distance in a carriage with frosted glass windows to the house where he is to examine the machine. Hatherley is still under the spell of the 50 guineas and does not become afraid even when a woman at the house warns him to flee. He is presently shown the press and makes his recommendations as to needed repairs. Then, he rashly decides to inspect the press more closely. His discovery that its floor is covered by a crust of metallic deposit confirms his suspicion that the machine is not used for pressing fuller's earth. When he rashly confronts Stark with the knowledge, Stark tries to kill him. He narrowly escapes getting crushed to death when Stark turns the machine on, but he escapes the press with the aid of the woman. Pursued by the murderous Stark, Hatherley is forced to jump from a second story window, in the process getting his thumb severed by Stark's cleaver. Hatherley survives the fall but passes out in the rose bushes, coming to hours later by a hedge near the rail station. Holmes then makes sense of the happenings, recognizing Stark and his allies as counterfeiters . The general gist of the story was retained, but contained several differences, namely Professor Moriarty being in charge of the counterfeiting instead of Stark , and the case being brought to Hound's attention through the engineer's young daughter instead of the engineer himself, who is being kept prisoner for the majority of the episode. The story was also adapted in the 1986 Soviet TV movie The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson The Twentieth Century Approaches. There, the criminal is Eduardo Lucas from The Adventure of the Second Stain , and the gang's work is economic sabotage by the German Empire. Upon hearing the details, Mycroft Holmes decides to balance the damage by producing an equal amount of counterfeit German currency. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, also titled The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb , aired in 2001.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which aired on 17 December 1931, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 24 February 1935 .Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 20 October 1940. Other episodes in the same series that were adapted from the story aired in June 1943 and January 1948 .A radio adaptation aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1960, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick. The Engineer's Thumb was dramatized by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1991, as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured John Moffatt as Lysander Stark.The story was adapted as an episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083. Dickerson, Ian .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the tenth of the twelve stories collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in April 1892.  Synopsis The story entails the disappearance of Hatty, Lord St. Simon's bride on the day of their marriage. She participates in the wedding, but disappears from the reception. The events of the wedding day are most perplexing to Lord St. Simon as it seemed to him that his bride, Miss Hatty Doran of San Francisco, was full of enthusiasm about their impending marriage. St. Simon tells Holmes that he noticed a change in the young lady's mood just after the wedding ceremony. She was uncharacteristically sharp with him. The only thing out of the ordinary at the church where the wedding took place was Hatty's little accident: she dropped her wedding bouquet and a gentleman in the front pew picked it up and handed it back to her. After the bridal party entered Hatty's father's house for the wedding breakfast, a former companion of St. Simon, the dancer Flora Millar, caused a disturbance at the door and was ejected. Hatty was seen talking to her maid upon arrival at the house; ten minutes into the wedding breakfast, Hatty claimed a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. A short time later, it was discovered that she had left the house. There are many questions that Holmes must sift through. Who was that woman trying to get in to the wedding breakfast? Who was that man in the front pew? Who was that man seen going into Hyde Park with Hatty? Why were Hatty's wedding dress and ring found washed up on the shore of the Serpentine? What had become of her? For Holmes it proves rather an elementary case, for he has dealt with similar cases and this one is not so complex to unravel, despite the confusion it causes Dr. Watson and Inspector Lestrade, the latter of which attempted to drag the Serpentine in search of Lady St. Simon's body. Holmes finds Hatty and the strange man from the front pew, and the d nouement takes the form of Holmes having Hatty explain herself to Lord Robert. Hatty and the mystery man, Francis H. Moulton, were husband and wife. They parted on the day of their wedding so that he could try to amass a fortune by prospecting. He was reported killed in an Apache raid on a mining camp where he was working. Hatty had given him up for dead, met Lord Robert, and decided to marry him, even though her heart still belonged to Frank. Frank had only been taken prisoner by the Apache raiders, and he escaped and tracked Hatty to London. He arrived at the church in time for the ceremony and she recognized him instantly. Rather than have her make a scene at the church, he gestured her to be silent, and wrote a note which he slipped to her as he returned her bouquet. She had wanted to abscond without ever telling anybody, but Holmes had tracked them down and convinced them that it would be better to have the full truth. However, Lord Robert is unmoved by Hatty's apologies and feels that he has been very ill used.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in May 1892.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the eleventh of the twelve stories collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in May 1892.  Plot  A banker, Mr. Alexander Holder of Streatham, makes a loan of 50,000 to a socially prominent client, who leaves a beryl coronet one of the most valuable public possessions in existence as collateral. Holder feels that he must not leave this rare and precious piece of jewellery in his personal safe at the bank, and so he takes it home with him to lock it up there. He is awakened in the night by a noise, enters his dressing room, and is horrified to see his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, apparently trying to bend it. Holder's niece Mary comes at the sound of all the shouting and, seeing the damaged coronet, faints dead away. Three beryls are missing from it. In a panic, Mr. Holder travels to see Holmes, who agrees to take the case. The case against Arthur seems rather damning, yet Holmes is not convinced of his guilt. Why is Arthur refusing to give a statement of any kind? How could Arthur have broken the coronet and without making any noise? Could any other people in the household be involved, such as the servants, or Mary? Could some visitor, such as the maid's wooden legged suitor, or Arthur's rakish friend Sir George Burnwell, have something to do with what happened to the coronet? The failure to resolve the case will result in Mr Holder's dishonour, and a national scandal. Holmes sets about not only reviewing the details that he learns from Holder but also by examining the footprints in the snow outside. Eventually, Holmes solves the mystery, and Holder is flabbergasted to find that his niece was in league with a notorious criminal , although apparently, she is unaware of his character. The two of them escape justice; however, Holmes is convinced that they will receive their punishment in due time. Arthur's motive in allowing his father to think he was the thief was that he was in love with his cousin Mary and saw her passing the coronet to Burnwell outside the window. Holmes regains the jewels after threatening Sir George at gunpoint with an offer of 1,000 apiece ; Burnwell is shocked at Holmes' offer he had already sold them to a fence for 600. With the additional offer of no prosecution, Holmes buys the beryls from the fence for 3,000; Holmes receives 4,000 compensation but sternly scolds Holder that he owes his son an apology for erroneously assuming Arthur had stolen the coronet.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Copper Beeches , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the last of the twelve collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in June 1892.  Plot summary Violet Hunter visits Holmes, asking whether she should accept a job as governess a job with extraordinary conditions. She is enticed by the phenomenal salary which, as originally offered, is 100 a year, later increased to 120 when Miss Hunter balks at having to cut her long copper coloured hair short . This is only one of many peculiar provisos to which she must agree. The employer, Jephro Rucastle, seems pleasant enough, yet Miss Hunter obviously has her suspicions. She announces to Holmes, after the raised salary offer, that she will take the job, and Holmes suggests that if he is needed, a telegram will bring him to Hampshire, where Mr. Rucastle's country estate, the Copper Beeches, is situated. After a fortnight, Holmes receives such a message, beseeching him to come and see her in Winchester. Miss Hunter tells them one of the most singular stories that they have ever heard. Mr. Rucastle would sometimes have Miss Hunter wear a particular electric blue dress and sit in the front room reading, with her back to the front window. She began to suspect that she was not supposed to see something outside the window, and a small mirror shard hidden in her handkerchief showed her that she was right: a man was standing there on the road looking towards the house. At another such session, Mr. Rucastle told a series of funny stories that made Miss Hunter laugh until she was quite weary. The one astonishing thing about this was that Mrs. Rucastle not only did not laugh but did not even smile. There were other unsavoury things about the household. The six year old child that she was supposed to look after was astonishingly cruel to small animals. The servants, Mr. and Mrs. Toller, were quite a sour pair. A great mastiff was kept on the property and always kept hungry. It was let out to prowl the grounds at night, and Miss Hunter was warned not to cross the threshold after dark. Also, Toller, who was quite often drunk, was the only one who had control over the dog. There was also the odd discovery by Miss Hunter of what appeared to be her own tresses in a locked drawer. Upon checking her own luggage, however, they turned out to be another woman's, but identical in every way to Miss Hunter's, even to the unusual colour. However, the most disturbing thing of all about the household was the mystery wing. Miss Hunter had observed a part of the house that did not seem to be used. The windows were either dirty or shuttered, and once she saw Mr. Rucastle coming out of the door leading into the wing looking most perturbed. Later, he explained that he used the rooms as a photographic darkroom, but Miss Hunter was not convinced. When he is drunk, Toller leaves the keys in the door to the mystery wing. Miss Hunter sneaks in. She finds the place spooky, and when she spots a shadow moving on the other side of a locked door, she panics and runs out into Mr. Rucastle's waiting arms. Mr. Rucastle does not reproach her; instead, he pretends to comfort her. However, he overdoes his act and alerts her suspicions, causing her to claim that she saw nothing. In an instant, his expression changes from comfort to rage. With the great detective's aid, it is discovered that someone has been kept a prisoner in the forbidden wing. The purpose of hiring Miss Hunter becomes clear: her presence is to convince the man watching from the road that Rucastle's daughter Alice, previously unknown to Miss Hunter and whom she resembles, is no longer interested in seeing him. Holmes, Watson, and Miss Hunter find Miss Rucastle's secret room empty; Rucastle arrives and thinks the trio has helped his daughter escape and goes to fetch the mastiff to set upon the trespassers. Unfortunately for Rucastle, the dog has been accidentally starved for longer than usual and attacks him instead. Watson shoots the dog with his revolver. Later, Mrs. Toller confirms Holmes' theory about Rucastle's daughter and reveals that when Alice came of age, she was to receive an annuity from her late mother's will; Rucastle tried to force his daughter to sign control of the inheritance over to him, which only resulted in Alice becoming ill with brain fever; hence, the cut hair. Rucastle then tried to keep Alice away from her fianc by locking her up in the mystery wing and hiring Miss Hunter to impersonate Alice. Rucastle's daughter escapes with her fianc , and they marry soon after. Watson notes that Holmes appears to have been drawn to Miss Hunter. However, to his disappointment, Holmes does not show any interest in Miss Hunter after the mystery has been solved, which was the real force behind his feelings. Rucastle survives as an invalid, kept alive solely by his second wife. Miss Hunter later becomes principal of a girls' school, where she meets with considerable success.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Copper Beeches was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in June 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in July 1892. The story was published with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as the short film The Copper Beeches , starring Georges Tr ville and directed, though uncredited, by Adrien Caillard, as part of the clair film series. The Copper Beeches was one of a series of eight silent film adaptations of the Holmes stories that were actually supervised by Conan Doyle. It is the only one that has survived. It is altered in several respects. Instead of beginning with Ms Hunter's visit to Baker Street to tell her story, it starts with Rucastle trying to force his daughter to sign away her rights to her fortune, and then ordering her fiance off his property. Rucastle subsequently locks up his daughter. The film only has Holmes , and there is no appearance of Mrs Rucastle nor the servants. Nor is there any mastiff hound. The scheme of why Rucastle wants Ms Hunter to trim her hair and stand by the window is the same, but the motive is different: Rucastle seeking to lure the fiance back so he can pretend he shot him as a trespasser. In the end Holmes and the police capture Rucastle, and the daughter and her fiance are united. Another short film adaptation, The Copper Beeches , was released as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood.The story was adapted as The Copper Beeches , a 1965 episode of Sherlock Holmes starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson, Suzanne Neve as Violet Hunter and Patrick Wymark as Jephro Rucastle. The Copper Beeches is a 1985 episode of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, with Natasha Richardson as Miss Hunter and Joss Ackland as Rucastle.  Radio  The Copper Beeches was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 17 November 1930, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another radio dramatisation of the story aired on 5 May 1935 . Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 6 October 1940. Other dramatisations of the story aired on 7 May 1943 and in November 1947 .The story was adapted by Felix Felton as a radio production that aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1955, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.An adaptation aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell. The Copper Beeches was dramatised by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1991 as an episode of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Roger Hammond as Jephro Rucastle and Imogen Stubbs as Violet Hunter.The story was adapted as a 2015 episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Print  Peter Cannon has pointed to parallels between The Adventure of the Copper Beeches and H. P. Lovecraft's story The Picture in the House .In Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds, Violet Hunter becomes the second wife of Dr. Watson mentioned in The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier . Hunter was said to have been married to the first mate on HMS Thunder Child.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083.

            "text": "Traditionally, the canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In this context, the term canon is an attempt to distinguish between Doyle's original works and subsequent works by other authors using the same characters. Usually capitalized by aficionados of the Sherlockian game as the Canon , the description of these 60 adventures as the Sherlock Holmes canon and the game of applying the methods of Higher Criticism to it was started by Ronald Knox as a playful use of the traditional definition of canon as an authoritative list of books accepted as holy scripture.  Novels The four novels of the canon: A Study in Scarlet The Sign of the Four The Hound of the Baskervilles The Valley of Fear  Short stories The 56 short stories are collected in five books: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes The Return of Sherlock Holmes His Last Bow The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes   The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes  Published 14 October 1892; contains 12 stories published in The Strand between July 1891 and June 1892 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget.

Rumours have always surrounded lost works, and in recent years further investigations have revealed more to the traditionally collected canon. As there exists no definitive body to argue what is, and what is not canon beyond the already established novels and stories, it is unlikely that any piece, no matter how good its claim to be canonical will ever be popularly received into published versions of the Complete Sherlock Holmes. However, as many as eighteen works have been cited as possible entrants. These works include plays, poems, essays on the character, and even short stories. Published collections of extracanonical works include: Sherlock Holmes: The Published Apocrypha, edited by Jack Tracy; The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, edited by Peter Haining; The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes, edited by Richard Lancelyn Green; and the final volume of Leslie S. Klinger's Sherlock Holmes Reference Library titled The Apocrypha of Sherlock Holmes. These works, each with slightly different contents, discussed several titles and their place in the canon.  Noncanonical works by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  In addition to the canon, Doyle wrote a number of vignettes, play adaptations and essays involving Holmes, and two short stories in which Holmes makes a possible cameo appearance. Most were published in various places during his lifetime; another has only come to light since his death. These are listed below with further detail. All these works except the plays are collected in The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.   Short stories    The Field Bazaar   The Field Bazaar was written for an Edinburgh University fundraising event. Doyle had been requested by his university to contribute a short piece of literature for a charity magazine. In the story, Watson has received a similar request and whilst he reads the letter at breakfast, Holmes correctly deduces the sender of the letter and Watson's thoughts with regard to the letter. It has many similarities with the canonical stories, most notably the metafictional twist in which Watson supplants Doyle as the author publishing his own stories in a magazine. It also plays upon not only the famous skill of Holmes' observations producing apparently miraculous results, but also the notion of the traditional breakfast scenes which open many Holmes short stories.   The Story of the Man with the Watches   Though Doyle had killed off his character in The Final Problem , he still wrote other short stories for publication in The Strand Magazine, including The Story of the Man with the Watches . It was collected in Doyle's Round the Fire Stories and Tales of Terror and Mystery . The story concerns the appearance of a dead man in a railway carriage, with six pocket watches in his jacket. An explanation is offered by an unnamed well known criminal investigator , but the narrator notes that it is flawed, as it doesn't take into account all the facts. A man involved in the accidental murder of the victim writes a letter to the detective, saying that it was a mighty ingenious solution but entirely incorrect and continues to share the true events of that day. Some commentators have proposed that the unnamed detective is Holmes. The story shares the same backing for categorising as a Sherlock Holmes story as The Story of the Lost Special , and appears in French anthologies. The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 2009 as The Thirteen Watches , in an episode from The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The number of watches was changed because the new title came from a reference to Holmes' involvement with the watches incident. The story was also adapted for radio in 2012 as The Addleton Tragedy , an episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.   The Story of the Lost Special   The Story of the Lost Special was published in The Strand Magazine in August 1898. It depicts a seemingly inexplicable mystery in which a special train and its few passengers disappear between two stations. After the mystery is described in full, it is stated that a letter appeared in the press, giving a proposed solution from an amateur reasoner of some celebrity . As with The Story of the Man with the Watches , it is possible, and has been proposed by Haining, Tracy, and Green, amongst others that this amateur reasoner was Sherlock Holmes. The strongest clue to this is the quotation, once one has eliminated the impossible... , used by Holmes throughout his deductions. However, this suggested solution is proved wrong by a confession from the organising criminal once he is later arrested for an unrelated crime. Haining suggested that Doyle was getting out some Holmes during the series hiatus, but given the failure of the unnamed detective it appears he was parodying his most famous creation. The story was published in book form in Doyle's Round the Fire Stories , and has for years appeared in French editions of the complete adventures.   Plot for Sherlock Holmes Story   When searching through Doyle's papers, Hesketh Pearson, a biographer of his, came across a plan for an unwritten story. As Richard Lancelyn Green notes, there is no evidence to show that it is by Doyle and strong internal evidence to suggest that it's not . Various authors have attempted to complete the story and put it alongside the canon. Some are very close to Doyle's plot, others include variations from it. However no 'official' completion has been made .   How Watson Learned the Trick   In 1922, several authors were approached to contribute to the library of Queen Mary's Dolls' House. Doyle wrote a short Sherlock Holmes story, just 503 words long, onto the tiny pages of a specially constructed miniature book: How Watson Learned the Trick . The story was later published alongside works by other authors in The Book of the Queen's Dolls' House Library . Though written 28 years after The Field Bazaar , this is almost a companion piece to that story. Like The Field Bazaar , this story is a breakfast scene, during which Watson attempts to mimic Holmes' style in guessing his thoughts. Watson's intuitions are proved wrong, however. Unlike almost all parts of the Sherlock Holmes story it is written in the third person, presumably due to its length.  Stageplays    Angels of Darkness   Unpublished until 2000, this play was written shortly after A Study in Scarlet was published. It is essentially a rewrite of the American chapters of A Study in Scarlet, with the London action moving to San Francisco. Holmes is not present, but Watson is, in a very different form. He acts discreditably and even marries another woman. The publication of this play was at first suppressed, Doyle's biographer, John Dickson Carr stated that it would do no good for the public to read this, a view that Haining endorses readily. The play is notable for its contrasting sensationalist and comic scenes, and it is contained in Klinger's Apocrypha.   Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts   The original Sherlock Holmes play written by Arthur Conan Doyle and William Gillette had a successful run of over 30 years. It has many original parts which are not found in the short stories but borrows many events from the canonical adventures, namely A Scandal in Bohemia and The Adventure of the Final Problem . Also, it had elements from A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Boscombe Valley Mystery , The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter , and The Adventure of the Naval Treaty . It includes the very first mention of the phrase Elementary, my dear Watson . While Doyle wrote the original version, it is unclear how much of his material survived in the play as performed, which was written by Gillette. Doyle and Gillette later revised the play together; it has since been revised by others twice.   The Speckled Band   Around 1902, Doyle wrote and produced a play based on his short story The Adventure of the Speckled Band . It premi red 8 years later, at the Adelphi Theatre, London on 4 June 1910, with H. A. Saintsbury as Sherlock Holmes and Lyn Harding as Dr. Grimesby Roylott. The play, originally entitled The Stonor Case, differs from the story in several small details, such as the names of some of the characters and the timeline is also changed. Holmes mentions Mary Morstan, who had already proposed Dr. Watson, twice and Charles Augustus Milverton also appears as a character.   The Crown Diamond: An Evening With Mr Sherlock Holmes   The Crown Diamond is an alternate version of the short story The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone though it predates its counterpart by some time, Sometime during the original run the short story was adapted from the play, this is the reason that the narrative is told in third person rather than by the traditional narrator Watson. Some claim that the play originally appeared in an early draft of Sherlock Holmes and was later removed, with some elements finding their way into The Adventure of the Empty House before the entire play was resurrected, some years later, into The Crown Diamond and The Mazarin Stone.   Essays and retrospectives  Arthur Conan Doyle rarely gave interviews or publicly discussed his character. However, the following is a list of Doyle essays on his character which are currently in publication, either in Green or Haining's book or in standard editions of the Complete Stories:   To An Undiscerning Critic   Guiterman first published his homage in America in Life and then in London Opinion , and in his collection The Laughing Muse. Doyle's answer appeared in the 26 December 1912 issue of London Opinion and was reprinted in the memoir of the editor of London Opinion, Lincoln Springfield. The late Dean Dickensheet appears to be the first to print the poems together, in An 'Undiscerning Critic' Discerned.   Some Personalia about Mr. Sherlock Holmes   This essay was featured in The Strand Magazine as a Christmas treat to its readers. It talks of the way Holmes had caught the public imagination and Doyle's view on his character.   The Truth About Sherlock Holmes   An essay from Collier's Weekly, in which Doyle explains exactly where Holmes came from. It contains, at the end, J. M. Barrie's The Adventure of the Two Collaborators .   Mr. Sherlock Holmes to His Readers   This appeared in The Strand Magazine to introduce a competition to name the best Sherlock Holmes adventures. The same essay, with two paragraphs cut, appears as the preface to The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes.   How I Made My List   This is the sequel to the article mentioned above. In it, Doyle listed what he thought were the best Holmes adventures. He noted that had he been able to include stories from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes he would certainly have included The Adventure of the Lion's Mane and The Adventure of the Illustrious Client . The list is as follows: The Adventure of the Speckled Band The Red Headed League The Adventure of the Dancing Men The Adventure of the Final Problem A Scandal in Bohemia The Adventure of the Empty House The Five Orange Pips The Adventure of the Second Stain The Adventure of the Devil's Foot The Adventure of the Priory School The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual The Adventure of the Reigate Squire Richard Lancelyn Green's The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes also includes five prefaces to the various editions of Sherlock Holmes stories and novels, Doyle's speech at the Stoll Convention Dinner , some chapters from Doyle's autobiography Memoirs and Adventures, and several interviews.  Works of interest by other authors  These are works which have in the past been thought to have been written by Doyle. Some have been conclusively proved to have no Doyle input, the composition of others still remains unclear.  The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes   The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes, is a 1954 collection of stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle's son Adrian Conan Doyle and Arthur's biographer, novelist John Dickson Carr. The stories are generally extrapolations of cases briefly mentioned in the canonical work, but tend to contradict themselves and each other. They are generally considered Sherlock Holmes pastiches.The stories contained in the collection are: The Adventure of the Seven Clocks The Adventure of the Gold Hunter The Adventure of the Wax Gamblers The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle The Adventure of the Black Baronet The Adventure of the Sealed Room The Adventure of Foulkes Rath The Adventure of the Abbas Ruby The Adventure of the Dark Angels The Adventure of the Two Women The Adventure of the Deptford Horror The Adventure of the Red Widow   Short stories    The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted   This mystery, a completed Sherlock Holmes story, was found in 1942 by a Doyle biographer, Hesketh Pearson, searching through a box of Doyle's papers. It was originally announced that the story would not be published by the Doyle estate, but it was announced it certainly was by Doyle, as the manuscript supposedly appeared in his own handwriting. However, according to Jon L. Lellenberg in Nova 57 Minor, the manuscript was not in Doyle's handwriting, but typewritten. The Strand Magazine published extracts from it in August 1943, and it was finally published after demand from Sherlock Holmes societies in 1947, when it was embraced as a new part of the canon by The Baker Street Irregulars amongst others. Initial suspicions of forgery were reported by Vincent Starret.In September 1945, a letter was received by Hesketh Pearson, a biographer of Sir Arthur. The letter stated, My pride is not unduly hurt by your remark that 'The Man who was Wanted' is certainly not up to scratch for the sting is much mitigated by your going on to remark that it carries the authentic trade mark! This, I feel, is a great compliment to my one and only effort at plagiarism. The letter was written by an architect named Arthur Whitaker who had sent the story to Arthur Conan Doyle in 1911 with a suggestion that they publish it as a joint collaboration. Doyle refused, but sent Whitaker a cheque for ten guineas in payment for the story. After seeing it attributed to Sir Arthur in the Sunday Dispatch, Whitaker wrote a letter to Denis Conan Doyle explaining the true authorship. Denis forwarded the letter to his brother Adrian, who became angry, demanded proof, and threatened legal action. Whitaker had retained a carbon copy and the Doyles admitted in 1949, after seeing the carbon copy and listening to people who had read it in 1911, that Whitaker was the author. Doyle had bought the story, in the thought that he might use the idea at a later date, but he never did. Pearson, Green, Tracy and the Doyle estate agree that Whitaker wrote the story, though Haining still claims that the opening scene between Holmes and Watson betrays the hand of the master , and that the story is partly written by Doyle. He points out that Doyle's wife, sons and biographer were fooled by the style, and it is possible there was a redraft made. The story is published in Penguin's The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes collection under the title of The Adventure of the Sheffield Banker.   The Adventure of the Two Collaborators   Though never claimed by any serious critic to be a Doyle work, this parody is listed here due to a popular misconception that this was written by Doyle for his friend, J. M. Barrie . In fact, this story was written by Barrie for Doyle following a period of the two of them working together on a play, Jane Annie. The story itself involves Doyle and Barrie visiting Holmes, with Doyle killing Holmes due to his irritating intelligence .  Stageplays  The Painful Predicament of Mr Sherlock Holmes The recognition of William Gillette as Sherlock Holmes was growing as a result of the success of the play Sherlock Holmes. Playing upon his most famous role, a short comedy sketch performed by William Gillette as a curtain raiser to an unrelated play. It involves a mute Sherlock Holmes, and a very talkative client. In Haining and Tracy's books, they speculate as to whether or not this play was written by Arthur Conan Doyle. Certainly Gillette would have needed Doyle's consent to write an original work involving Sherlock Holmes, as the character was under copyright, but it is presumed by most Sherlockians that Gillette wrote the whole thing himself. Haining, however claims that Gillette may have asked Doyle to 'whip up something quickly for him'. However, no manuscript exists in Doyle's hand, and no reference of the play is left by him, it has been assumed by most that it is little more than a William Gillette curiosity.

            "text": "The Adventure of Silver Blaze , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the first from the 12 in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in December 1892.Doyle considered Silver Blaze among his favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. One of the most popular Sherlock Holmes short stories, Silver Blaze focuses on the disappearance of the eponymous race horse on the eve of an important race and on the apparent murder of its trainer. The tale is distinguished by its atmospheric Dartmoor setting and late Victorian sporting milieu. The plotting hinges on the curious incident of the dog in the night time :  Plot summary  Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson travel by train to Dartmoor to investigate a crime of disappearance of the great race horse Silver Blaze and the murder of the horse's trainer, John Straker. Holmes and Watson arrive at King's Pyland, from which Silver Blaze is missing. Bookmaker Fitzroy Simpson had come to Dartmoor to gather information about Silver Blaze and his stablemate Bayard. He had approached both Straker's maid and a stable boy the night of the horse's disappearance and has been arrested for the murder. However, to Holmes, there seem to be a number of facts that do not fit the case against Simpson, damning as it looks. It seems odd, for instance, that he would lead the horse out on to the moor simply to injure or kill him, which could be done right in his stall. He could not have stolen the animal. What good would such a famous thoroughbred be to him? Why has an exhaustive search of the neighbourhood not turned up Silver Blaze? What has Simpson done with him? Sherlock Holmes soon tracks down Silver Blaze, literally: his tracks are clearly visible in the soil, albeit intermittently. Holmes also deduces why the police could not find the horse, despite having looked right at him. Holmes ensures Silver Blaze's safety, and turns his mind to other aspects of the case. John Straker, Silver Blaze's late trainer, has been killed by a blow to the skull, assumed to have been administered by Simpson with his Penang lawyer , a clublike walking stick. Simpson's cravat is also found in Straker's hand, and the latter's coat is found draped over a furze bush. A knife is found at the crime scene a peculiarly delicate looking one, with a small blade. Dr. Watson, from his medical experience, identifies it as a cataract knife used for the most delicate surgery useful as it is for that purpose, it would be unsuitable as a weapon. In addition, Straker also seems to have gashed himself in the hip with it. One of the stable lads, Ned Hunter, was on guard duty the night of the crime, but he proves to have been drugged with powdered opium placed in his supper. No one else who ate the curried mutton made at the Strakers' house that evening suffered any ill effects, but Hunter was in a profound stupor well into the next day. Straker's pockets contained two interesting items: a tallow candle and a milliner's bill for a 22 guinea dress, made out to one William Derbyshire. There is the curious incident with the dog, and a problem with the sheep kept at the stable: a shepherd tells Holmes that three of his animals have recently become suddenly lame. Holmes's powers unravel the mystery, and lay bare what villainies there are to be exposed. He visits the milliner's shop in London and determines, using Straker's photograph, that Straker posed as Derbyshire. This establishes his motive: he had a mistress with expensive tastes, and tried to influence the race's outcome to earn himself a large sum of money. The curried mutton was a clue, also; only such a spicy dish could have masked the taste of powdered opium, and it was impossible for Simpson to arrange a highly seasoned meal that evening for his purposes. Therefore, someone in the household must have conceived the idea namely, Straker himself. The curious incident of the dog in the night time is easily explained: the dog made no noise, because no stranger was there. As Holmes explains: I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others.... Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well. It was Straker who removed Silver Blaze from his stall and led him out on to the moor. Straker's purpose in doing this was to use the cataract knife to inflict a slight injury upon one of the horse's legs, rendering him temporarily lame in a way that would be undetectable on examination and thus likely put down to strain. He had thought to use Simpson's cravat as a sling to hold the horse's leg to cut it. But instead, Straker was killed when the horse, sensing that something was wrong, panicked and kicked the trainer in the head. The lame sheep had been used by Straker for practice. Colonel Ross's main concern, of course, is getting his horse back safely. Holmes chooses not to tell Ross where his horse has been until after the Wessex Cup, which is won by Silver Blaze. At first the Colonel does not recognize his own horse, since the animal's distinguishing white markings have been covered with dye. The horse had been looked after by one of the Colonel's neighbours, Silas Brown, who had found him wandering the moor and hidden him in his barn. Holmes then explains the details of the case step by step to the satisfaction of the Colonel, Watson, and Inspector Gregory. Gregory is one of the more competent police detectives Holmes works with in the course of his career. He conducts a thorough investigation of the crime before Holmes's arrival, and gathers all the evidence Holmes needs to solve the case. Holmes notes that Gregory is an extremely good officer , and observes that the only quality he lacks is imagination the ability to imagine what might have happened on a given occasion, and act on this intuition.  Publication history  The Adventure of Silver Blaze was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in January 1893. It was also published in Harper's Weekly on 25 February 1893. The story was published with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.

The protagonist of this novel, Christopher John Francis Boone, mentions Sherlock Holmes several times throughout the book.In the episode Service of All the Dead of the TV series Inspector Morse, Morse asks Sergeant Lewis how well he knows his Sherlock Holmes and starts to quote the passage, then a constable says the punchline to Lewis's further bewilderment. Without explicitly referencing or quoting the Sherlock Holmes story, the silence of a dog in the night time is similarly a clue in the crime film Beck Mannen utan ansikte. In Guards! Guards! Sir Terry Pratchett refers to the curious incident of the orang utan in the nighttime.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in January 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 14 January 1893. It is the second of twelve stories collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes in most British editions of the canon, and the second of the eight stories from His Last Bow in most American versions.  Synopsis Miss Susan Cushing of Croydon receives a parcel in the post that contains two severed human ears packed in coarse salt. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard suspects a prank by three medical students whom Miss Cushing was forced to evict because of their unruly behaviour. The parcel was sent from Belfast, the city of origin of one of the former boarders. Upon examining the parcel himself, Holmes is convinced that it is evidence of a serious crime. He reasons that a medical student with access to a dissection laboratory would likely use something other than plain salt to preserve human remains, and would be able to make a more precise cut than the roughly hacked ears suggest. The address on the package, roughly written and with a spelling correction, suggests to Holmes that the sender lacks education and is unfamiliar with Croydon. The knot in the string suggests to Holmes that they are looking for someone with sailing experience. Holmes considers the solution so simple that he asks Lestrade not to mention his name in connection with it. A few simple questions to Miss Cushing, a few observations, a cable to Liverpool, and a visit to Miss Cushing's sister Sarah convince Holmes that the ears belong to Miss Cushing's other sister, Mary, and her extramarital lover, and that they have been murdered. He is convinced that Mary's estranged husband, Jim Browner, is the murderer, and that Browner had sent the cardboard box containing the ears to the Cushings' house in Croydon , not realizing that Sarah was no longer resident there. Browner, who is an unpleasant man when drunk, had meant to horrify Sarah because he ultimately blamed Sarah for causing the trouble that culminated in his murder of his wife and her lover. Browner is indeed a sailor, and Belfast was the first port where he had the chance to post the parcel. Lestrade, acting on Holmes's information, is waiting to arrest him when his ship reaches London. He confesses everything. He is presented with considerable sympathy, a simple man so tormented by guilt at his act that he would welcome being hanged. The real villain of the story morally if not legally is Sarah Cushing, who fell in love with and tried to seduce Browner herself; then, when he rejected her advances, set out to wreck his marriage with her sister Mary, by poisoning her mind to her own husband and by introducing and pushing her onto a new lover, which she easily took to, especially given her husband's propensity for getting drunk . In the end, her husband's inability to accept her betrayal, and sheer jealousy at discovering the affair, causes him to commit what Holmes considers a crime of passion .  Publication history  The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 14 January 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand in February 1893. In The Strand Magazine, the story included eight illustrations by Sidney Paget. It did not include any illustrations in Harper's Weekly. The Adventure of the Cardboard Box was not published in the first British edition of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, but it was published in the first American edition, though it was quickly removed because of its controversial subject matter. The story was later published again in 1917 in His Last Bow. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place, within the Memoirs.When The Adventure of the Cardboard Box was removed from publication, Conan Doyle moved a passage from it that showed Holmes mind reading Watson to The Adventure of the Resident Patient . This passage reveals Dr. Watson to be an avid admirer of Henry Ward Beecher, whose portrait he keeps at his home. The passage seems to have little to do with the mystery but may be a subtle reference to the theme of adultery as Beecher was famously put on trial for the offense in 1875, an event many contemporary readers would have remembered.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a short silent film titled The Cardboard Box in 1923, as one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. Hilda Anthony played Mary Browner and Johnny Butt played James Browner.The Granada TV adaptation with Jeremy Brett, televised on 11 April 1994, was generally faithful to the original. It contained some minor variations: in the story Browner kills his wife and her lover at sea whereas in the adaptation he kills them near a pond; and the adaptation places the action at Christmas time in the midst of a cold and snowy winter, while the original story took place in high summer . Holmes's eloquent speech at the end of the episode questions the very nature of humanity. He asks toward what end mortals pursue this circle of misery, violence, and fear , concluding that it must have a purpose, or else our universe has no meaning, which is unthinkable. But what purpose? That is humanity's great problem, to which reason, so far, has no answer. This was the last episode broadcast, and includes Brett in ill health at the end of his run as the famous detective. Ciaran Hinds played the role of Jim Browner. The Elementary episode Ears to You is a loose adaptation of this story. The setup for this episode is very similar to that story two human ears are mailed to someone, packed in salt but includes several variations, including the twist that the ears were actually sent by the supposed victim, who underwent a complex experiment to literally grow fake ears on her back so as to frame the primary suspect for her murder. The 2018 HBO Asia Hulu Japan series Miss Sherlock loosely adapts this story as the episode Stella Maris. As the series is set in Tokyo, the misleading address on the box containing the ear in the original story is adapted as a mailing label with unclearly written katakana.  Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired on 5 November 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another production of the story aired in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.Meiser also adapted the story for The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for episodes that aired in January 1940 and August 1943 with Basil Rathbone playing Holmes and Nigel Bruce playing Watson. The story was adapted for the BBC Light Programme in 1960 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Cardboard Box was dramatised by Roger Danes for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 as an episode of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson . It featured Kevin Whately as Browner and Teresa Gallagher as Mary Browner; it also introduced Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade, who had previously been played by Donald Gee.In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of the radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.In 2020, the story was adapted in bengali language by Indian radio channel radio mirchi. The adaptation was very well received by the bengali audience.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083. Dickerson, Ian .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Yellow Face , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the third tale from The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in February 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 11 February 1893.One of Doyle's sentimental pieces, the story is remarkable in that Holmes' deduction during the course of it proves incorrect. According to Dr. Watson: ...where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded... Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered.  Synopsis plot  Sherlock Holmes, bored due to a want of cases, returns home from a walk with Dr. Watson early in spring to find he has missed a visitor but that the caller has left his pipe behind. From it, Holmes deduces that he was disturbed of mind ; that he valued it highly ; that he was muscular, left handed, had excellent teeth, was careless in his habits and was not needed to practice economy. None of these deductions is particularly germane to the story: they are merely Holmesian logical exercises. When the visitor, Mr. Grant Munro returns, Holmes and Watson hear the story of Munro's deception by his wife Effie. She had been previously married in America, but her husband and child had died of yellow fever, whereupon she returned to England and met and married Munro. Their marriage had been blissful says Grant Munro until she asked for a hundred pounds and begged him not to ask why. Two months later, Effie Munro was caught conducting secret liaisons with the occupants of a cottage near the Munro house in Norbury. Grant Munro has seen a mysterious yellow faced person in this cottage. Overcome with jealousy, he breaks in and finds the place empty. However, the room where he saw the mysterious figure is very comfortable and well furnished, with a portrait of his wife on the mantelpiece. Holmes, after sending Munro home with instructions to wire for him if the cottage was reoccupied, confides in Watson his belief that the mysterious figure is Effie Munro's first husband. He postulates that the husband, having been left in America, has come to England to blackmail her. After Munro summons Holmes and Watson, the three enter the cottage, brushing aside the entreaties of Effie Munro. They find the strange yellow faced character, and Holmes peels the face away, showing it to be a mask, and revealing a young girl who is half black. It is then revealed that Effie Munro's first husband was John Hebron, an African American lawyer; he did die in America, but their daughter, Lucy, survived. At the time Effie came to England, she could not bring Lucy with her, as the child was still ill enough that the transition might have exacerbated her state. But later, after she and Grant were married, Effie got word that Lucy was alive and well. Upon hearing of this, Effie became overcome with desire to see her child again, so she asked for the hundred pounds and used it to bring Lucy and her nurse to England, and installed them in the cottage near the Munro house. She feared, however, that Grant might stop loving her if he found out that she was the mother of a mixed race child, so all the while, she had made every endeavour to keep Lucy's existence a secret. Both Watson and Holmes are touched by Munro's response. Watson observes: ...when Munro's answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards the door. We can talk about it more comfortably at home, said he. I am not a very good man, Effie, but I think I am a better one than you have given me credit for being. Holmes excuses himself and Watson, and, that evening, after they have returned to Baker Street, says: Watson, if it should ever strike you that I am getting a little overconfident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.  Treatment of race Doyle's sympathetic treatment of interracial marriage, between an Englishwoman and a black lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia, appears extraordinarily liberal for the 1890s. Though the story has the widow treating her dead husband's race as a secret whose revelation might entail negative reactions, the marriage is not illegal in Britain, and her second husband's loving response is reported approvingly by Watson.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the fourth of the twelve collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes in most British editions of the canon, and third of eleven in most American ones . The story was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly in the same month.  Synopsis  A young clerk, Hall Pycroft, consults Holmes with his suspicions concerning a company that has offered him a very well paid job. Holmes, Watson and Pycroft travel by train to Birmingham, where the job is initially to be based, and Pycroft explains that he was recently made redundant from a stockbroking house. He eventually secured a new post with another group of stockbrokers, Mawson and Williams, in Lombard Street in the City. Before taking up the job, he was approached by Arthur Pinner, who offered him a managership with a newly established hardware distribution company, to be based in France. Pycroft is sent to Birmingham to meet Pinner's brother and company co founder, Harry Pinner. He is offered a very well paid post with 100 in advance, and is asked to sign a document accepting the post, and is also asked not to send a letter of resignation to his current employers. He immediately commences his duties, but he is concerned about the unprofessional aspects of the business and their sparse offices, as well as the suspicious fact that the two Pinners have a distinctive gold filling in their teeth in the same place, suggesting that they might be the same man. When the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock. As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft's handwriting so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons . Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker. From the newspaper, they learn that Mawson Williams have suffered an attempted robbery, but that the criminal had been captured, although the weekend watchman has been murdered. Beddington, the forger and cracksman, was the miscreant, masquerading as Pycroft, and his brother was masquerading as Pinner. American railway bonds worth nearly 100,000 were taken, together with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, but the police recovered them from the thief. As the police are called to arrest 'Pinner', Holmes observes that Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited .  Commentary This story's plot is reminiscent of that in The Red Headed League , for it, too, involves an elaborate hoax designed to remove an inconvenient person from the scene for a while so that a crime can be committed. The same parallel can be seen in The Adventure of the Three Garridebs . However, in contrast to these other two cases, the 'inconvenient person' in this case proves insightful enough to realize at least some of the deception on his own accord, whereas the other cases see Holmes being brought in to investigate more peripheral matters. It is worth noting that Holmes is not involved in the apprehension of the thief, who has already been arrested, but is able to turn the accomplice over to the police.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March 1893. It was also published in the US in Harper's Weekly on 11 March 1893, and in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in April 1893.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Gloria Scott , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in April 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 15 April 1893.It is chronologically the earliest case in Sherlock Holmes canon. This story is related mainly by Holmes rather than Watson, and is the first case to which Holmes applied his powers of deduction, having treated it as a mere hobby until this time. This is one of numerous Sherlock Holmes stories in which a protagonist is haunted by an old acquaintance for an old crime. The others include The Boscombe Valley Mystery Black Peter , The Sign of Four , The Five Orange Pips , The Resident Patient , etc. It is also one of his many stories that deal with the fate of characters who return to England after having spent time abroad in the colonies of the British Empire.  Synopsis  In his university days, Holmes spent a month with his friend, Victor Trevor, at Victor's father's estate in Norfolk. While there, Holmes amazed his host, Victor's father, who was a Justice of the Peace and a landowner. He had made his fortune in the goldfields in Australia. One of Holmes's deductions was that the elder Mr. Trevor was once connected with someone with the initials J. A. whom he wanted to forget. His host then passed out on the table. Holmes had touched a sore spot, and possibly did not believe the old man's explanation once he had come back to himself that J. A. had been an old lover. Holmes perceived that he was making his host uncomfortable and decided to take his leave. The evening before he did this, another old man suddenly appeared at the house causing the elder Mr. Trevor to rush for a shot of brandy before greeting him. They had apparently been shipmates some 30 years earlier, and Mr. Trevor said something about finding him some work. Soon afterwards, Holmes and his friend found Mr. Trevor drunk. Holmes then left the Trevor estate and spent the next seven weeks at his chemistry experiments, suddenly receiving a telegram from the younger Trevor begging him to come back to Norfolk. Once he got there, Victor told Holmes that his father was dying as a result of a stroke suffered after he received a letter. They found that he had died while Victor had been meeting Holmes at the station. After Holmes had left the house seven weeks earlier, it seems that this old man who had come looking for work, and whose name was Hudson, proved to be as unruly an employee as could be imagined. He had demanded to be promoted from gardener to butler and had got what he wanted. He had taken unforgivable liberties which would normally have resulted in an employee's dismissal. He was often drunk. Victor could not stand him and would have beaten Hudson up if he had been younger. The other staff had complained about him. However, Victor's father always let him get away with any infamy. Suddenly, Hudson announced that he was leaving because he had tired of Norfolk, and he was going to Hampshire to see Beddoes, another old shipmate. Now, Holmes's friend had become thin and careworn by the ordeal. He had thought that the trouble was over when Hudson had left, but then came the letter, from Fordingbridge in Hampshire. It read: The supply of game for London is going steadily up. Head keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly paper and for preservation of your hen pheasant's life. It meant nothing to Victor, and it was quite a while before Holmes saw anything in it. He found the key. If one read every third word beginning with the first, there was an intelligible message: The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life. Holmes had deduced that the game was blackmail. Some guilty secret had been the power that Hudson had held over the elder Mr. Trevor. The old man's dying words to his doctor unlocked the secret. Some papers were found in Mr. Trevor's Japanese cabinet. The document was a confession. The elder Mr. Trevor had once borne the name James Armitage and had been a criminal having embezzled money from the bank where he worked and been caught. He was sentenced to transportation. Once on the ship, the Gloria Scott, bound for Australia from Falmouth, Armitage found out from a neighbouring prisoner that there was a conspiracy to take over the ship. The neighbour, Jack Prendergast, had financed the scheme out of the nearly 250,000 in unrecovered money from his crime. Many of the crew, even officers, were in his employ, and even the chaplain Wilson, who was not truly a clergyman at all. Wilson, while pretending to minister to the prisoners, was actually furnishing them with pistols and other equipment to be used when the time was right. Armitage also drew his other neighbour, Evans, into the scheme. As might be expected, all did not go as planned. The takeover was accomplished unexpectedly when the ship's doctor discovered a pistol while treating a prisoner. The prisoners then had to make their move right away or they would lose the element of surprise. In the ensuing m l e, the Captain and many other men were killed, and there arose a dispute between Prendergast with his supporters and a group including Armitage over what to do with the few loyal crewmen still left alive. Armitage and others would not stand for cold blooded murder. They were cast adrift in a small boat to make their way as they would. Shortly after leaving in their small boat, the Gloria Scott blew up as the result of the violence spreading to where the gunpowder was kept. The men in the small boat, among whom was also Evans, hurried back to the site and rescued one survivor Hudson. The next day, as luck would have it, the men were rescued by another ship, the Hotspur, also bound for Australia. They passed themselves off as survivors from a passenger ship and once in Australia, headed for the goldfields. Armitage changed his name to Trevor, and Evans changed his name to Beddoes. Both later returned to England as rich men. All had gone well until Hudson had suddenly shown up. Since no scandal involving the Gloria Scott ever followed the odd message from Beddoes , and since neither Hudson nor Evans was ever heard from again, the Police believed Hudson had done away with Beddoes while Holmes believed that Evans had likely killed Hudson, believing that he had told all, when in fact he had not, and then fled with as much money as he could lay his hands on. The case is referenced by Holmes once more in The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire when Holmes consults an index of his past exploits for references to vampires and remarks on the Voyage of the Gloria Scott listed under V . It is also mentioned in passing in The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual as Holmes recounts to Watson his early cases when he first became a detective.  Discrepancy The confession account contained a scribbled footnote from the elder Trevor that recorded the fatal note delivered to him. This contradicts the stated fact that Trevor never regained consciousness until the very end of his life, at which time he merely revealed where the confession lay. According to Trevor's confession the Gloria Scott left Falmouth thirty years ago and precisely in 1855, but that would set Holmes's enquiry in 1885 and not in his college years, as he told Watson. Since further in the story the elder Trevor writes also: For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives , we can assume that the exact date is around 1875, which would fit Holmes's reference to his college years. It is also possible that the thirty years was a rounding of twenty five years, which would place the case in 1880.  Publication history The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 15 April 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand in May 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK in December 1893 and in the US in February 1894.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a 1923 short film for the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.The 1954 1955 Sherlock Holmes television series starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and H. Marion Crawford as Watson loosely adapted the story for its episode The Case of the Blind Man's Bluff , changing the name of the ship to the Gloria North . It retains elements from the story, such as a respectable character with a tattoo he has tried to erase but which Holmes observes anyway . The episode was later remade, retaining the plot structure and much of the dialogue, for the 1980 American Polish series Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson starring Geoffrey Whitehead, which was also produced by Sheldon Reynolds. The Gloria Scott was a 2001 episode of the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, in which the titular prison ship was a spacecraft en route to the Moon. In the 2014 episode The Empty Hearse , the first episode of the third series of the BBC television series Sherlock, Dr. Watson's fiancee, Mary Morstan, solves a coded text message on a cellphone by reading every third word. In the fourth series episode The Final Problem in 2017, it is revealed that Holmes had a childhood friend named Victor Trevor.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 21 January 1932. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 14 April 1935 and 1 October 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes as an episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, which aired on 28 December 1941.The story was adapted as an episode of the American radio series CBS Radio Mystery Theater titled The Gloria Scott . The episode, which starred Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in November 1977. The Gloria Scott was dramatised by Vincent McInerney for BBC Radio 4 in 1992, as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Simon Treves as Victor and Terence Edmond as Trevor.A 2008 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Print  In 2005, Croatian writer Mima Simi published a short story collection entitled Pustolovine Glorije Scott . This loose adaptation introduces a queer parody of the Sherlock Holmes canon through the gender reversal of the protagonists: disastrous detective Gloria Scott and her faithful assistant Mary Lambert. A TV animation series based on this adaptation was under development as of 2014. The 2016 book The Murder of Mary Russell by Laurie R. King is based on the premise that Gloria Scott's Hudson is none other than the father of Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual is a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The story was originally published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in May 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 13 May 1893. It was collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Unlike the majority of Holmes stories, the main narrator is not Doctor Watson, but Sherlock Holmes himself. With Watson providing an introduction, the story within a story is a classic example of a frame tale. It is one of the earliest recorded cases investigated by Holmes, and establishes his problem solving skills. The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual shares elements with two Edgar Allan Poe tales: The Gold Bug and The Cask of Amontillado . In 1927, Conan Doyle ranked the story at 11th place on his top 12 Holmes stories list. The story did better in a 1959 chart produced by The Baker Street Journal, ranking 6th out of 10.  Plot In the story, Holmes recounts to Watson the events arising after a visit from a university acquaintance, Reginald Musgrave. Musgrave visits Holmes after the disappearance of two of his domestic staff, Rachel Howells, a maid, and Richard Brunton, the longtime butler. The pair vanished after Musgrave had dismissed Brunton for secretly reading a family document, the Musgrave Ritual. The Ritual, which dates from the 17th century, is a riddle set in question response form. It reads: Musgrave caught Brunton in the library at two o'clock one morning. Not only had he unlocked a cabinet and taken out the document in question, but he also had what looked like a chart or map, which he promptly stuffed into a pocket upon seeing his employer watching him. Brunton besought Musgrave not to dishonour him by dismissing him, and asked for a month's time to invent some reason for leaving, making it seem as though he was leaving of his own accord. Musgrave granted him a week. The story later reveals that Brunton wanted the time for something else. A few days later, Brunton disappeared, leaving behind most of his belongings. His bed had not been slept in. No sign could be found of him. The maid, Rachel Howells, who had been Brunton's former lover until he had broken their engagement for another woman, had a hysterical fit when asked about Brunton's whereabouts, repeating over and over that he was gone. She was in such a state that another servant was posted to sit up with her at night. Eventually, however, the guarding servant nodded off one night, and the hysterical Rachel Howells escaped through a window. Her footprints led to the edge of the mere, and ended there. Musgrave had the mere dredged, but only a sack containing some rusty, mangled bits of metal, and some coloured stones or glass were found. Rachel Howells was never heard from again. Holmes looked upon the case not as three mysteries, but as one. He considered the riddle of the ritual. It was a meaningless, absurd tradition to Musgrave, and apparently to all his ancestors going back more than two centuries, but Holmes and Brunton, too, Holmes suspected saw it as something very different. He quickly realized that it was a set of instructions for finding something. Ascertaining the height of the oak, which was still standing, and the position of the elm, which was now gone, Holmes performed a few calculations and paced out the route to whatever awaited him, with Musgrave now eagerly following him. It was quite instructive to Holmes that Brunton had recently asked about the old elm tree's height as well, and that he was apparently quite intelligent. The two men found themselves inside a doorway, momentarily disappointed, until they realized that there was the last instruction, and so under . There was a cellar under where they were standing, as old as the house. Finding their way into it, they saw that the floor had been cleared to expose a stone slab with an iron ring on it with Brunton's muffler tied to it. Holmes thought it wise to bring the police in at this point. He and a burly Sussex policeman managed to lift the slab off the little hole that it was covering, and inside, they found an empty, rotten chest, and Brunton, who had been dead for several days. There were no marks on him. He had likely suffocated. Holmes then put everything together for his rather shocked client. Brunton had deduced the ritual's meaning, at least insofar as it led to something valuable. He had determined the elm tree's height by asking his master, had paced out the instructions and Holmes had later even found a peg hole in the lawn made by Brunton had found the hiding place in the old cellar, but then had found it impossible to lift the stone slab himself. So, he had been forced to draw someone else into his treasure hunt. He had unwisely chosen Rachel Howells, who had good reason to hate him. The two of them could have lifted the slab up, but they would have needed to support it while Brunton climbed down to fetch the treasure. Based on Rachel's sudden flight and disappearance, Holmes wondered if she had deliberately kicked the supports away and left Brunton to die, or if the slab had fallen back into place by itself and caused her to panic. As to the relics found in the bag retrieved from the mere, Holmes examined them and found that the metal parts were gold and the stones were gems. He believed that it was no less than King Charles I s medieval crown of St. Edward, being kept for his eventual successor his son, Charles II , who would not be crowned until 11 years after the execution of Charles I. The ritual had been a guide to retrieving this important symbol, and Reginald confirms that one of his ancestors, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a king's man. Holmes theorized that the original holder of the ritual had died before teaching his son about its significance. It had thus become nothing more than a quaint custom for more than 200 years. One final plot twist is that the Musgraves are allowed to keep the crown fragments, although the ritual makes it clear that they were only to keep the relic in trust as it was in fact Crown property.  Publication history The story was originally published in the Strand Magazine in May 1893, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. It was later collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The Strand's text of the ritual did not specify the month in which the shadow of the elm should be measured , but a couplet was added for the Memoirs identifying the month as the sixth from the first . The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual was also published in the US in Harper's Weekly on 13 May 1893, and in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in June 1893. The story was published with six illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted for the 1912 French British clair film series as a silent short film.It was also adapted as a short film as part of the Stoll film series. The film was released in 1922.The 1943 film Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, part of the Basil Rathbone Nigel Bruce series of films, loosely adapted the story, though the ritual was completely re written to represent a chess game played on the floor of the Musgrave mansion. Also the treasure is a land grant that was given to the Musgraves by Henry VIII instead of the lost crown of Charles I. The story was adapted for the 1965 BBC series Sherlock Holmes with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.The story was adapted for an episode of Sherlock Holmes, the Granada Television series starring Jeremy Brett. The episode deviated from the original by including Watson in the adventure; the story nods to the framing device of the original by having Holmes, not looking forward to the trip, remark that he intends to organise some of his old cases before he met Watson in order to keep himself occupied. In addition, the story features an actual oak tree, which Holmes describes as a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen. In the Granada film version, however, Holmes utilizes a weathervane in the shape of an oak perched on top of the Musgrave mansion to solve the mysterious ritual. At the very end of the teleplay, Rachel's body is shown to have been found after having floated up from the mere. Further, the 12th line of the ritual is adapted to suit the scenery and the 5th and 6th lines are omitted. It was filmed in the 400 year old Baddesley Clinton Manor House near Birmingham, UK. This house was the Musgrave home in the TV episode. In the original story, this was one of Holmes early cases just after he had graduated from college; in the adaptation, the time sequence is moved to when Holmes had partnered with Watson to solve mysteries. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled The Musgrave Ritual , first aired in 1999.Episodes 9 and 10 of the 2013 Russian TV series Sherlock Holmes are based on the story, although the storyline is quite different including some action scenes and Brunton being in fact a revenging member of a family of Musgraves' rivals. The Musgrave Ritual is adapted as part of the storyline of the final episode of the fourth season of Sherlock, The Final Problem ; as children, the Holmes family lived in an old house called Musgrave, but after Sherlock and Mycroft's sister Eurus was involved in the disappearance of Sherlock's dog best friend , all Eurus would provide as a clue was a strange song. Years later, with John Watson's life at stake as he is trapped in the same location where Eurus left her first victim, Sherlock deduces that the song relates to the unusual dates on various fake gravestones around the house, the resulting 'code' leading him to Eurus' old room to make an emotional appeal to his sister to spare John.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 5 January 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.The story was adapted for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 16 July 1943.A 1962 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation aired as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.An adaptation aired on BBC radio in June 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell. The Musgrave Ritual was adapted as a 1981 episode of the series CBS Radio Mystery Theater with Gordon Gould as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson. The Musgrave Ritual was dramatised by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robert Daws as Reginald Musgrave and Michael Kilgarriff as Sergeant Harris.A 2014 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Stage  T. S. Eliot stated that he adapted part of the Ritual in his 1935 verse play Murder in the Cathedral as a deliberate homage.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Reigate Squire , also known as The Adventure of the Reigate Squires and The Adventure of the Reigate Puzzle , is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom and Harper's Weekly in the United States in June 1893. It is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Reigate Squire twelfth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.  Summary Watson takes Holmes to a friend's estate near Reigate in Surrey to rest after a rather strenuous case in France. Their host is Colonel Hayter. There has recently been a burglary at the nearby Acton estate in which the thieves stole a motley assortment of things, even a ball of twine, but nothing terribly valuable. Then one morning, the Colonel's butler tells news of a murder at another nearby estate, the Cunninghams'. The victim is William Kirwan, the coachman. Inspector Forrester has taken charge of the investigation, and there is one physical clue: a torn piece of paper found in William's hand with a few words written on it, including quarter to twelve , which was approximately the time of William's murder. Holmes takes an instant interest in the note. One of the first facts to emerge is that there is a longstanding legal dispute between the Actons and the Cunninghams involving ownership of about half of the estate currently in the Cunninghams' hands. Holmes interviews the two Cunningham men, young Alec and his ageing father. Alec tells Holmes that he saw the burglar struggling with William when a shot went off and William fell dead, and that the burglar ran off through a hedge to the road. The elder Cunningham claims that he was in his room smoking at the time, and Alec says that he had also still been up. Holmes knows that it would be useful to get hold of the rest of that note found in William's hand. He believes that the murderer snatched it away from William and thrust it into his pocket, never realizing that a scrap of it was still in the murdered coachman's hand. Unfortunately, neither the police nor Holmes can get any information from William's mother, for she is quite old, deaf, and somewhat simple minded. Holmes, apparently still recovering from his previous strenuous case, seems to have a fit just as Forrester is about to mention the torn piece of paper to the Cunninghams. Afterward, Holmes remarks that it is extraordinary that a burglar would break into the Cunninghams' house when the Cunninghams were both still awake and had lamps lit. Holmes then apparently makes a mistake writing an advertisement that the elder Cunningham corrects. Holmes insists on searching the Cunninghams' rooms despite their protests that the burglar could not have gone there. He sees Alec's room and then his father's, where he deliberately knocks a small table over, sending some oranges and a water carafe to the floor. The others were not looking his way at the time, and Holmes implies that the cause is Watson's clumsiness. Watson plays along and starts gathering up scattered oranges. Everyone then notices that Holmes has left the room. Moments later, there are cries of murder and help . Watson recognizes his friend's voice. He and Forrester rush to Alec's room where they find Alec trying to throttle Holmes and his father apparently twisting Holmes's wrist. The Cunninghams are quickly restrained, and Holmes tells Forrester to arrest the two for murdering William Kirwan. At first, Forrester thinks Holmes must be mad, but Holmes draws his attention to the looks on their faces very guilty. After a revolver is knocked out of Alec's hand, the two are arrested. The gun is the one that was used to murder William, and it is seized. Holmes has found the rest of the note, still in Alec's dressing gown pocket. It runs thus : If you will only come round at quarter to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much surprise you and maybe sic be of the greatest service to you and also to Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter. Holmes, an expert at studying handwriting, reveals that he had realized earlier from the torn piece of paper that the note was written by two men, each writing alternate words. He had perceived that one man was young, the other rather older, and that they were related, which led Holmes to conclude that the Cunninghams wrote the letter. Holmes saw that the Cunninghams' story was false since William's body has no powder burns on it, so he was not shot at point blank range as the Cunninghams claim. The escape route also does not bear their story out: there is a boggy ditch next to the road that the fleeing murderer would have had to cross, yet there are no signs of any footprints in it. Holmes had faked his fit to prevent the Cunninghams from being reminded about and destroying the missing part of the note, and made a mistake in the advertisement on purpose to get the elder Cunningham to write the word twelve by hand, to compare it with the note fragment. The elder Cunningham's confidence is broken after his arrest and he tells all. It seems that William followed his two employers the night they broke into the Acton estate . William then proceeded to blackmail his employers not realizing that it was dangerous to do such a thing to Alec and they thought to use the recent burglary scare as a plausible way of getting rid of him. With a bit more attention paid to detail, they might very well have evaded all suspicion.  Holmes and Watson This is one of the rare stories that show a glimpse of Watson's dedication and his life before he met Holmes, as well as Holmes' trust in Watson. Colonel Hayter is a former patient who Watson treated in Afghanistan and has offered his house to Watson and Holmes. Watson admits in convincing Holmes, A little diplomacy was needed, for Holmes resists anything that sounds like coddling or sentimentalism. Watson also glosses over the facts of Holmes' illness from overwork, implying redundancy because all of Europe was ringing with his name. Holmes' health has collapsed after straining himself to the limit, and his success in the case means nothing to him in the face of his depression. With his superhuman physical and mental achievement, he has a correspondingly drastic fit of nervous prostration and needs Watson's assistance. Holmes clearly has no problem with asking Watson for help when he needs it, for he sends a wire and Watson is at his side twenty four hours later. At the onset of the mystery, Watson warns Holmes to rest, not to get started on a new problem. However, Watson knows and has revealed in other writings that inactivity is anathema to Holmes, and his caution comes off as weak. Holmes takes it all with humour, but the reader does not doubt his mind is eagerly upon the trail of the crime. At the conclusion, he tells Watson: I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated, to Baker Street to morrow.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Crooked Man , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in July 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 8 July 1893.Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Crooked Man 15th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.  Synopsis Holmes calls on Watson late one evening to tell him about a case that he has been working on, and also to invite him to be a witness to the final stage of the investigation. Colonel James Barclay, of The Royal Mallows based at Aldershot Camp, is dead, apparently by violence, and his wife, Nancy, is the prime suspect. The Colonel's brother officers are quite perplexed at the Colonel's fate, as most of them have always believed that he and Nancy were a happy couple. They have observed over the years, however, that the Colonel seemed more attached to his wife than she to him. They have also noticed that the Colonel sometimes had bouts of deep depression and moodiness for no apparent reason. As a married officer, the Colonel lived with his wife in a villa outside the camp at Aldershot. Nancy went out that evening with her next door neighbor, Miss Morrison, on an errand connected with her church, coming back not long afterward. She went into the seldom used morning room and asked the maid to fetch her some tea, which was unusual for Nancy. Hearing that his wife had returned, the Colonel joined her in the morning room. The coachman saw him enter, and that was the last time that he was seen alive. The morning room's blinds were up, and the glass door leading out onto the lawn was open. When the maid brought the tea, she heard an argument in progress between Nancy and her husband, and she heard Nancy say the name David . She fetched the other maid and the coachman, who came and listened. Nancy was very angry and shouting about what a coward her husband was; his words were softer and less distinct. Suddenly, the Colonel cried out, there was a crash, and Nancy screamed. Realizing that something awful had just happened, the coachman tried to force the locked door, but could not. He remembered the outside glass door, and went outside to get into the room through that. Upon entering, he found that Nancy had fainted, and the Colonel was lying dead in a pool of his own blood. The coachman summoned the police and medical help, and also found, to his surprise, that the key was not in the locked door on the inside. Later, a thorough search failed to turn it up. A peculiar club like weapon was also found in the morning room. Although the staff has seen the Colonel's weapon collection, they do not recognize this weapon. Holmes believes that the case is not what it initially appears to be. Although the staff are quite sure that they only heard the Colonel's and his wife's voices, Holmes is convinced that a third person came into the room at the time of the Colonel's death and, rather oddly, made off with the key. This Holmes deduces from footmarks found in the road, on the lawn, and in the morning room. Odder still, the mystery man seems to have brought an animal with him. Judging from the footmarks it made, it is long with short stumpy legs, like a weasel or a stoat, but bigger than either of those animals. It left claw marks on the curtain, too, leading Holmes to deduce that it was a carnivore, for there was a bird cage near the curtain. Holmes is sure that Miss Morrison holds the key to the mystery, and he is right. She claims to know nothing of the reason for the argument between her neighbors, but when Holmes tells her that Nancy could easily face a murder charge, she feels that she can betray her promise to her and tells all. On their short outing, the two women met a bent, deformed old man carrying a wooden box. He looked up at Nancy and recognized her, and she him. Nancy asked Miss Morrison to walk on ahead as there was apparently a private matter to discuss with this man. She came back very angry and made her friend swear not to say anything about the incident, claiming the man was a former acquaintance who had fallen on hard times. This breaks the case wide open for Holmes. He knows that there cannot be many men of this description in the area, and soon identifies him as Henry Wood, and goes with Watson to visit him the next day in his room. Wood explains all. He had been a corporal in the same regiment as Colonel Barclay, who was still a sergeant at that time, at the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, then known as the 'Mutiny'. Also at this time, he and Barclay were both vying for Nancy's hand. Henry was not deformed and much better looking in those days. The regiment was confined to its cantonment by the turmoil in India, and water had run out, among other problems. A volunteer was asked to go out and summon help, and Henry volunteered to do so. Sergeant James Barclay later the Colonel instructed Henry on the safest route to take. But as Henry traveled along the route, he was attacked and taken prisoner, being knocked unconscious in the process. When he came to, he gathered from what he knew of the local language, spoken by his captors, that Sergeant Barclay had betrayed him to the enemy, driven by one motive to get rid of Henry so he could have Nancy for himself. Henry was tortured repeatedly, which is how he became deformed, spent years as a slave or wandering, made money as a conjurer, and when he was getting old, he longed to come back to England. He sought out soldiers because he was familiar with the milieu. Then, quite by chance, he met Nancy that evening, who was shocked to learn he was alive. Unknown to her, however, he followed her home and witnessed the argument, for the blinds were up and the glass door open. He climbed over the low wall and entered the room. An apoplectic fit caused by the sight of him killed the Colonel instantly, and Nancy fainted. Henry's first thought then was to open the inside door and summon help, and he took the key from the now unconscious Nancy to do so. Realizing that the situation looked very bad for him and that he himself could be charged with murder, he chose instead to flee, stopping long enough to retrieve Teddy, his mongoose that he used in his conjuring acts, which had escaped from the wooden box. However, he did drop his stick, the strange weapon that was later found, and he inadvertently carried the key off with him. An inquest has already exonerated Nancy, having found the cause of the Colonel's death apoplexy . As for David , this was apparently a reproach in which Nancy likened her husband to the biblical king, who had Bathsheba's husband Uriah transferred to a zone with heavy fighting so that he would be killed, leaving David free to marry Uriah's wife.  Commentary  Elementary, my dear Watson is an often quoted line from Sherlock Holmes. However, Holmes never says this in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. In The Adventure of the Crooked Man, though, he comes his closest to it: I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson, said he. Excellent! I cried. Elementary, said he.The Granada Television version reverses the oft quoted Elementary, my dear Watson by ending with Watson deducing that Holmes had looked up a passage in the Bible since they returned home from Aldershot. When Holmes asks Watson how he knew he replies Elementary, my dear Holmes after explaining how he reached his conclusion. The exact date of this story's setting is unknown, but since Nancy has been married for upward of thirty years and the Indian Rebellion broke out in 1857, the date would seem to be sometime after 1887. The first few lines by Watson tell that this story occurred in the summer just after his marriage which was in 1889; thus summer of 1889 would be about right.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Crooked Man was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in July 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 8 July 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in August 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a 1923 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured Gladys Jennings as Mrs Barclay and Dora De Winton as Miss Morrison.The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original except that it has the housekeeper, instead of the coachman, tell Holmes of the clue of the missing key. It also hints that the Mallows are a Lancers regiment and that Barclay owed most of his rapid rise in ranks from Sergeant to Officer due at least in part to his marriage to the daughter of the regimental sergeant major rather than merit, as Murphy was already a young sub officer at the time Barclay was a Sgt; at the time of the story Murphy is still only a major in temporary command of the regiment. It starred Norman Jones as Henry Wood, Lisa Daniely as Nancy Barclay, Denys Hawthorne as James Barclay, Fiona Shaw as Miss Morrison, Paul Chapman as Major Murphy, Shelagh Stephenson as Jane, Michael Lumsden as young Henry Wood, Catherine Rabett as young Nancy, and James Wilby as young Barclay. The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century titled The Crooked Man .Holmes describes this case to his addiction group in the episode A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs in the CBS TV series Elementary.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 1 December 1930, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the later American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that was broadcast on 10 November 1940.Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a 1966 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Crooked Man was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Brian Blessed as Henry Wood and Terence Edmond as Major Murphy. This adaptation contains a twist to the end of the denouement scene: after Holmes has left the room, Watson advises Wood to wait a while and then return to Nancy Barclay, that his disfigurement will not matter to her. Wood answers ambiguously, and the matter is left unresolved. The story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083. Dickerson, Ian .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Resident Patient , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The story was originally published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom and Harper's Weekly in the United States in August 1893.Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Resident Patient eighteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.  Synopsis Doctor Percy Trevelyan brings Holmes an unusual problem. Having been a brilliant student but a poor man, Dr. Trevelyan has found himself a participant in an unusual business arrangement. A man named Blessington, claiming to have some money to invest, has set Trevelyan up in premises with a prestigious address and paid all his expenses. In return, he demands three fourths of all the money that the doctor's practice earns, which he collects every evening, going over the books thoroughly and leaving the doctor 5 3d of every guinea from the day's takings. Blessington is himself infirm, it turns out, and likes this arrangement because he can always have a doctor nearby. Everything has gone fairly well for the doctor since the arrangement began. Now, however, something has happened to Blessington. He has become excitable and agitated, this after he said that he had read about a burglary somewhere in the city. Shortly thereafter, the doctor acquired a new patient, a Russian nobleman with cataleptic fits. His grown son brought him in the evening while Blessington was taking his usual walk. The son insisted on waiting out in the waiting room while the doctor saw his father. During the consultation, the patient had a fit, sitting bolt upright and going quite rigid. The doctor rushed for some nitrite of amyl for his patient to inhale, but upon returning, found that both his patient and his son had left. Surprisingly, the same two men came back the next evening, the son claiming that he had seen his father walk out into the waiting room and assumed the consultation was over. He then had taken his father home, only later realizing that something was not quite right. The doctor had another consultation with the Russian gentleman, and after they had left, Blessington was utterly beside himself. Someone had been in his room. There were footprints to prove it. It could only have been the Russian nobleman's son, but why did he go in there? Nothing had been disturbed or stolen. At this point in Trevelyan's story, Holmes thinks that it would be wise to go to the doctor's Brook Street practice right away to see for himself what this odd case is all about. He discovers firsthand just how paranoid Blessington has become: he greets Holmes, Watson, and Trevelyan with a gun, but the doctor convinces him that the visitors mean no harm. Holmes asks Blessington who these men are, and why they want to molest him. Blessington nervously says that he cannot answer the first question, but by way of answering the second question, he says that he keeps all his money in a box in his bedroom, as he does not trust bankers. Holmes knows that it must be more than this. He leaves in disgust, advising Blessington that he can expect no advice if he tries to deceive him. Shortly after leaving, Holmes outlines to Watson his train of thought. He knows that two men, perhaps more, are out to get Blessington. The catalepsy was faked, just to keep Doctor Trevelyan busy so that he would not notice the other man going into Blessington's room. They did not wish to steal anything, as can be seen in their failure to rummage around in the room. They chose an appointment in the evening knowing that there would be no other patients in the waiting room. Holmes also knows just looking at Blessington that he is afraid for his own life, and deduces that he must therefore know who is after him, for no man could have such enemies without knowing about it. Also, it was only by chance that Blessington was not in both times that these two men came; they were obviously not familiar with Blessington's personal habits. The next morning brings news that Blessington has hanged himself. Trevelyan's brougham is sent to 221B Baker Street to bring Holmes to the scene. When Holmes and Watson arrive, Blessington's body is still hanging from a hook in his bedroom ceiling. Inspector Lanner is there. He believes that it is a suicide, but Holmes soon deduces otherwise. Discarded cigar butts and other clues tell him that three other men were there, and for a while. They were let into the premises by a confederate inside, as the door was still barred in the morning. Suspicion falls on the new page, who has vanished. It seems obvious to Holmes that the men came to try Blessington, and reached a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of death, which they then proceeded to carry out. A little digging at police headquarters brings up the rest of the truth. All four of the men were once members of a criminal gang that robbed banks. Blessington's real name was Sutton, and the other three, two of whom played the Russians, were Biddle, Hayward, and Moffat. After robbing the Worthington Bank of 7,000 in 1875, Blessington had turned informer, and as a result, another gang member, Cartwright, had been hanged for murdering the caretaker, and the others had each been given 15 years in prison. Blessington's paranoia was indeed a very real fear, caused by news of their early release, not by some burglary, as he claimed. The murderers chose hanging as their form of execution to avenge Cartwright. Eventually, the page turns up, but the case against him falls apart for lack of evidence. As for the other three, they are never heard from again, and it is believed that they perished in the wreck of the Norah Creina off Portugal.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Resident Patient was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in August 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 12 August 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in September 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.In many editions, the story starts with the Holmes mind reading scene from The Adventure of the Cardboard Box , which was added to this story after Doyle decided the latter story should not be included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a 1921 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured Judd Green as Blessington.In the 1985 Granada television adaptation starring Jeremy Brett, the episode presents Watson attempting to apply Holmes' methods to uncover his friend's current state but largely failing, although Holmes does admit that there is an element of truth in what you say . This scene is very much in the manner of the Doyle penned parody How Watson Learned the Trick , which also features Watson making incorrect conclusions about Holmes. Near the end of the episode, Watson initially intends to entitle his memoir of the case The Brook Street Mystery , but Holmes recommends the title The Resident Patient . During the credits, Watson wrestles with variations of the suggestion before settling on The Resident Patient . The ninth episode of Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century, a sci fi reimagining of some of Doyle's stories in which Holmes is brought back to life to combat a clone of Moriarty, is based on this story with significant changes. Blessington is a plastic surgeon who was coerced by Moriarty's henchman Martin Fenwick and some goons into using his experimental technology of molding one's face to another, as well as masking the subject's DNA for a short time before the effects wear off. Blessington survives this version.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 12 January 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script was broadcast on 14 March 1936 .Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that was broadcast on 23 February 1941.Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a BBC Light Programme radio adaptation that aired in 1961, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Hamilton Dyce as Trevelyan. The Resident Patient was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robert Lang as Blessington, Adjoa Andoh as Maria, and David Kossoff as Count Orlovsky.The story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2009.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083. Dickerson, Ian .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The story was originally published in The Strand Magazine and Harper's Weekly in September 1893. This story introduces Holmes's elder brother Mycroft. Doyle ranked The Greek Interpreter seventeenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.  Plot  On a summer evening, while engaged in an aimless conversation that has come round to the topic of hereditary attributes, Doctor Watson learns that Sherlock Holmes, far from being a one off in his powers of observation and deductive reasoning, in fact has an elder brother whose skills, or so Holmes claims, outstrip even his own. As a consequence of this, Watson becomes acquainted with the Diogenes Club and his friend's brother, Mycroft. Mycroft, as Watson learns, does not have the energy of his younger brother and as a consequence is incapable of using his great skills for detective work: If the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm chair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived. But he has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solution, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. In spite of his inertia, the elder Holmes has often delivered the correct answer to a problem that Sherlock has brought to him. On this occasion, however, it is Mycroft who has need to consult Sherlock. Mr. Melas, a Greek interpreter and neighbour of Mycroft, tells of a rather unnerving experience he has recently gone through. Melas was called upon one evening by a man named Harold Latimer to go to a house, supposedly in Kensington, to translate on a business matter. On the way there in Latimer's coach, Melas noticed that the windows were papered over so that he could not see where he was. Latimer also produced a bludgeon, laying it beside him as an implied threat. Melas protested, saying that what Latimer was doing was unlawful. The kidnapper replied that he would make it up to Melas, but also threatened him with unspecified retribution should the evening's business ever be made public. For approximately two hours they drove, at last arriving at a house. It was dark, and Melas got only a general impression of a large property as he was hustled out of the coach and into the house. The house itself was poorly lit, but Melas made out that it was quite big. In the room into which he was led by Latimer and another, nervous, giggling gentleman whose name is later discovered to be Wilson Kemp Melas noticed a deep pile carpet, a high marble mantel, and a suit of Japanese armour. Another man was brought into the room. He was thin and emaciated and had sticking plaster all over his face, and a bandage sealing his mouth. Melas knew then that things were not right. Melas was sly enough to observe that his kidnappers were utterly ignorant of Greek, and used this to find out some information. While Latimer and his giggling companion had Melas translate demands that this man sign some papers, Melas added his own short questions to the dialogue. The man not only answered Latimer that he would never sign these papers, but he also answered Melas that his name was Kratides, that he had been in London for three weeks, that he had no idea what house he was in, and that his captors at the house were starving him. He wrote all his answers, unable as he was to speak through the sticking plaster. Much could be inferred from Kratides's answers to Latimer, too. Evidently, Latimer was trying to coerce Kratides into signing over property to him, and a woman was also involved. Latimer had warned Kratides that his obstinacy would do her no good. Melas would have extracted the whole story from this stranger had the woman herself not burst in unexpectedly, but even that event furnished new information. She recognised Kratides as Paul , whereupon he managed to get the bandage off his mouth and he called her Sophy . They both behaved as though neither had expected to see the other. Melas was ushered back into the coach for another interminable ride and was deposited far from his home on Wandsworth Common. He made it to Clapham Junction just in time for the last train to Victoria. He has now presented his story at the Diogenes Club to Mycroft, who asks his brother Sherlock to look into it. An advertisement has already been placed begging the public for information. It yields a result. A Mr. Davenport knows the woman in question, and she is currently residing at The Myrtles, a house in Beckenham. Sherlock Holmes and his brother Mycroft, who received the message from Davenport, decide that they must go to Beckenham to see about this. Watson comes, too, and they decide to pick up Inspector Gregson, and Melas as well in case some translating needs to be done. They find, however, that he has already been picked up, by a nervous, giggling man brandishing a bludgeon. Holmes knows that this means trouble. Obviously the thugs know that Melas has betrayed them. After the necessary legal procedures for securing a search warrant have been completed, the group proceeds to Beckenham only to discover that the house, which indeed turns out to be as Melas has described, has been abandoned. Tracks indicate that a fully loaded coach has recently pulled out of the drive. Breaking in, they discover Melas and Kratides bound in a closed room where some charcoal has been lit to gas the two of them: Melas recovers thanks to Watson's timely intervention, but Kratides is already dead. Apparently, Kratides never signed any papers. It turns out that Sophy's friends contacted Kratides, who was Sophy's brother, in Greece to tell of what they thought was a bad situation for her with Latimer. He then came to England and wound up in Latimer's power. Latimer tried to force Kratides to sign over his sister's property, but he refused absolutely. All that is ever again heard of the thugs Latimer and Kemp is a news story from Hungary describing the deaths of two Englishmen who had been travelling with a woman . The official report attributes their deaths to a fight between the two of them; however, Watson notes in closing that Holmes believes Sophy to have avenged the abuse of Kratides and herself by stabbing both Latimer and Kemp.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 16 September 1893. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in October 1893. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in Harper's Weekly. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a 1922 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series. It starred Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featured J. R. Tozer as Harold Latimer and Robert Vallis as Wilson Kemp.The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.The third episode of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson is based upon The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton , but the beginning has a meeting between the heroes and Mycroft, with the scene being adapted from the story. The billiard maker they analyze through the window turns out, unknown to them, to be Milverton's informer and Moriarty's henchman. The story was adapted for television in 1985 as part of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, David Burke as Dr. Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft Holmes. The episode is largely faithful to the original short story, but certain changes are made; in particular, Kratides is eventually compelled to sign the paper and the ending is amended to have Holmes, Watson and Mycroft confront the villains on board a train as they attempt to escape to Greece, during which Latimer is killed as he attempts to escape and both Kemp and Sophia are taken into custody. Art in the blood, Watson. It is liable to take the strangest forms. Sherlock Holmes clarifies to Dr. Joan Watson in the first episode of the second season of the CBS TV series Elementary, which refers to the assertion in the story, that Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms. Art in the blood , twenty third episode of the second season of Elementary, which is named after an allusion from this story, updates many elements of the original story to the contemporary era. In the 24th episode, Sherlock describes Mycroft as a man who has no ambition and no energy and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right , which is directly quoted from the story. In the 2012 Sherlock episode A Scandal in Belgravia , Watson is seen writing a story in his blog titled The Geek Interpreter . In the 2014 episode The Empty Hearse , Sherlock and his brother Mycroft have a casual competition over analyzing a certain knitted hat, a reference to the discussion in this short story on analyzing a man they see on the street through the window of the Diogenes Club. In the 2015 special, The Abominable Bride, a Mr Melas is also referenced as waiting to see Mycroft after he has discussed a case with his brother and Dr. Watson. In the seventh episode of the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, Sherman, a female pupil of Beeton School who can communicate with animals is kidnapped. She is made to interpret dog's language to find a bone of Neanderthal stolen from a laboratory and taken away by a dog but no clue is found. Holmes decides to solve the case with the help of his elder brother Mycroft and visits him in the Diogenes Club in Dealer house where he lives. Though Holmes is estranged from Mycroft, the brothers and Watson discover the bone and find out that it's Wilson Kemp, a pupil who lives in Dealer house stole it but Mycroft tries to hush up the truth.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in October and November 1893, and in Harper's Weekly in the United States on 14 and 21 October 1893.Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Naval Treaty 19th in a list of his 19 favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.  Synopsis  Dr. Watson receives a letter, which he then refers to Holmes, from an old schoolmate, Percy Phelps, now a Foreign Office employee from Woking who has had an important naval treaty stolen from his office. It disappeared while Phelps had stepped out of his office momentarily late in the evening to see about some coffee that he had ordered. His office has two entrances, each joined by a stairway to a single landing. The commissionaire kept watch at the main entrance. There was no one watching at the side entrance. Phelps also knew that his fianc e Annie Harrison's brother Joseph was in town and that he might drop by. Phelps was alone in the office. Phelps pulled the bell cord in his office to summon the commissionaire, and to his surprise the commissionaire's wife came up instead. He worked at copying the treaty that he had been given while he waited. At last, he went to see the commissionaire when it had taken some time for the coffee to arrive. He found him asleep with the kettle boiling furiously. He did not need to wake him up, however, as just then, the bell linked to his office rang. Realizing that someone was in his office with the treaty still spread out on his desk, Phelps rushed back up and found that the document had vanished, as had the thief. It seemed obvious that the thief had come in through the side entrance; otherwise he would have passed Phelps on the stairs at some point, and there were no hiding places in his office. No footprints were seen in the office despite its being a rainy evening. The only suspect at that point was the commissionaire's wife, who had quickly hurried out of the building at about that same time. This was followed up, but no treaty was found with her. Other suspects were the commissionaire himself and Phelps's colleague Charles Gorot. Neither seemed a very likely suspect, but the police followed them both, and the commissionaire's wife. As expected, nothing came of it. Phelps was driven to despair by the incident, and when he got back to Woking, he was immediately put to bed in his fianc e's brother's room. There he remained, sick with brain fever for more than two months, his reputation and honour apparently gone. Holmes is quite interested in this case, and makes a number of observations that others seem to have missed. The absence of footprints, for instance, might indicate that the thief came by cab. There is also the remarkable fact that the dire consequences that ought to result from such a treaty being divulged to a foreign government have not happened in all the time that Phelps has been ill. Why was the bell rung? Holmes gathers some useful information at Briarbrae, the Phelps house, where Phelps' fianc e and her brother have also been staying. She has been nursing him days while a hired nurse kept watch over him at night. Joseph also remains to be of service if he can. After seeing Phelps at Woking, Holmes makes some inquiries in town. He visits Lord Holdhurst, Phelps's uncle, the Foreign Secretary, who gave his nephew his important task of copying the treaty, but Holmes dismisses him as a suspect, and is quite sure now that no one could have overheard their discussion about the task. Lord Holdhurst reveals to Holmes the potentially disastrous consequences that might occur if the treaty should fall into the hands of the French or Russian embassies. Fortunately, nothing has yet happened, despite the many weeks since the theft. Apparently, the thief has not yet sold the treaty, and Lord Holdhurst informs Holmes that the villain's time is running out, as the treaty will soon cease to be a secret. Why, then, has the thief not sold the treaty? Holmes returns to Woking, not having given up, but having to report that no treaty has turned up yet. Meanwhile, something interesting has happened at Briarbrae: someone tried to break in during the night, into Phelps's sick room, no less. Phelps surprised him at the window but could not see his face through the hooded cloak that he was wearing. He did, however, see the interloper's knife as he dashed away. This happened the very first night that Phelps felt he could do without the nurse. Unknown to anyone else at this point although Watson infers it from his friend's taciturnity Holmes knows what is going on. He orders Annie to stay in her fianc 's sick room all day, and then to leave it and lock it from the outside when she finally goes to bed. This she does. Holmes finds a hiding place near Briarbrae to keep watch after having sent Watson and Phelps to London on the train, and also letting the occupants at Briarbrae believe that he intended to go with them, ostensibly to keep Phelps out of harm's way should the interloper come back. Holmes waits until about two o'clock in the morning, when the interloper appears out of the house's tradesman's entrance. He goes to the window, gets it open as before, opens a hidden hatch in the floor, and pulls out the treaty. He then steps straight back out the window and Holmes intercepts him after which they fight, with Holmes emerging victorious but having suffered minor injuries. The treaty has been in Phelps's sick room all the time, while the thief, Joseph, who usually slept in that room, could not get to it. He rang the bell in Phelps's office after dropping by to visit and finding him not there, but then he saw the treaty and at once realized its potential value. His inability to reach the treaty explains why there have been no dire political consequences. Holmes explains that Joseph had lost a great deal of money on the stock market, which explains his need for money. Being a very desperate and selfish man, he cared nothing for the consequences Phelps might suffer from the document's loss. Always one with a flair for the dramatic, Holmes has the treaty literally served up to Phelps as breakfast the next morning at 221B Baker Street, London, where he has spent the night under Watson's watchful eyes . Phelps is ecstatic, Holmes is quietly triumphant, and once again, Watson is dumbfounded. Holmes explains that several clues all pointed to Joseph: the thief knew the ways of the office well, given that he had rung the bell just before seeing the treaty; Phelps had shown his relatives around the office; Joseph had dined in London that evening, and took the 11:00 PM train to Woking; Phelps expected to meet him for the train; the theft happened at about 9:40 PM; it was a rainy night, but there were no wet footprints in the passage or office, so the thief had come in a cab; and the burglar who tried to break into Phelps' room was familiar with the layout of the house and the habits of those who lived there.  Commentary This is the longest of the short stories published in The Strand Magazine before Sherlock Holmes's death in The Final Problem . As such, it was originally published in two parts.This story contains the first reference to The Adventure of the Second Stain , which would not be published until around 11 years later, although the facts of the later written story are different from those mentioned by Watson in The Naval Treaty.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Naval Treaty was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October and November 1893, and in the US in Harper's Weekly on 14 and 21 October 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the Strand one month after its UK publication. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine in October 1893, and with seven illustrations by Paget in November 1893. In Harper's Weekly, The Naval Treaty was published with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in the first part of the story, and with two other illustrations by Hyde in the second part. It was included in the short story collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.  Adaptations   Film and television  One of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes clair film series was based on the story. In the short film, titled The Stolen Papers, Georges Tr ville played Sherlock Holmes and Mr Moyse played Dr. Watson.Another short film based on the story was released in 1922 as part of the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.The story was adapted as the 1984 episode The Naval Treaty from the first series of the Granada TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which stars Jeremy Brett. The Great Game , the third episode of the television series Sherlock, uses The Adventure of the Naval Treaty and The Adventure of the Bruce Partington Plans as inspiration, as both deal with the theft of government papers related to the navy. Art in the Blood , the 23rd episode of Elementary, is inspired by the story. The Adventure of the One Hundred Tadpoles , a 2015 episode of the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, is based on the story. In the episode, Holmes and Watson try to take back a stolen picture which was entered in an art competition. The theme of the competition is tadpoles because Tadpole was the nickname of Sir Percy Phelps, founder of Beeton School.

The episode aired on 19 January 1931.

            "text": "The Final Problem is a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring his detective character Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom, and McClure's in the United States, under the title The Adventure of the Final Problem in December 1893. It appears in book form as part of the collection The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. This story, set in 1891, introduced Holmes's archenemy, the criminal mastermind Professor Moriarty. It was intended to be the final Holmes story, ending with the character's death, but Conan Doyle was later persuaded to revive Holmes for additional stories and novels. Conan Doyle later ranked The Final Problem fourth on his personal list of the twelve best Holmes stories.  Plot summary Holmes arrives at Dr. John Watson's residence one evening in a somewhat agitated state and with grazed and bleeding knuckles. Much to Watson's surprise and horror, Holmes had apparently escaped three separate murder attempts that day after a visit from Professor Moriarty, who warned Holmes to withdraw from his pursuit of justice against him to avoid any regrettable outcome. First, just as Holmes was turning a street corner, a cab suddenly rushed toward him and he just managed to leap out of the way in time. Second, while Holmes was walking along the street, a brick fell from the roof of a house, just missing the detective. He then called the police to search the whole area but could not prove that it was anything other than an accident. Finally, on his way to Watson's house, Holmes was attacked by a thug armed with a cosh. Holmes managed to overcome his assailant and handed him to the police but admitted that there was virtually no hope of proving that the man was in the employ of the criminal mastermind. Holmes has been tracking Moriarty and his agents for months and is on the brink of snaring them all and delivering them to the dock. Moriarty is the criminal genius behind a highly organised and extremely secret criminal force and Holmes will consider it the crowning achievement of his career if he can defeat Moriarty. Moriarty is out to thwart Holmes's plans and is well capable of doing so, for he is, as Holmes admits, the great detective's intellectual equal. Holmes asks Watson to come to the continent with him, giving him unusual instructions designed to hide his tracks to the boat train at Victoria station. Holmes is not quite sure where they will go, which seems rather odd to Watson. Holmes, certain that he has been followed to his friend's house, then makes off by climbing over the back wall in the garden. The next day Watson follows Holmes's instructions to the letter and finds himself waiting in the reserved first class coach for his friend, but only an elderly Italian priest is there. The cleric soon makes it apparent that he is, in fact, Holmes in disguise. As the boat train pulls out of Victoria, Holmes spots Moriarty on the platform, making gestures in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the train. Holmes is forced to take action as Moriarty has obviously tracked Watson, despite extraordinary precautions. Holmes and Watson alight at Canterbury, making a change to their planned route. As they are waiting for another train to Newhaven a special one coach train roars through Canterbury, as Holmes suspected it would. It contains the professor, who has hired the train in an effort to overtake Holmes. Holmes and Watson are forced to hide behind luggage. Having made their way to Strasbourg via Brussels, the following Monday Holmes receives a message that most of Moriarty's gang have been arrested in England and recommends Watson return there now, as the detective will likely prove to be a very dangerous companion. Watson, however, decides to stay with his friend. Moriarty himself has slipped out of the grasp of the English police and is obviously with them on the continent. Holmes and Watson's journey takes them to Switzerland where they stay at Meiringen. From there they fatefully decide to take a walk which will include a visit to the Reichenbach Falls, a local natural wonder. Once there, a boy appears and hands Watson a letter, saying that there is a sick Englishwoman back at the hotel who wants an English doctor. Holmes realises at once it is a hoax although he does not say so. Watson goes to see about the patient, leaving Holmes by himself. Upon returning to the Englischer Hof, Watson finds that the innkeeper has no knowledge of any sick Englishwoman. Realising at last that he has been deceived, he rushes back to the Reichenbach Falls but finds no one there, although he does see two sets of footprints going out onto the muddy dead end path with none returning. There is also a note from Holmes, explaining that he knew the report Watson was given to be a hoax and that he is about to fight Moriarty, who has graciously given him enough time to pen this last letter. Watson sees that towards the end of the path there are signs that a violent struggle has taken place and there are no returning footprints. It is all too clear Holmes and Moriarty have both fallen to their deaths down the gorge while locked in mortal combat. Saddened, Dr. Watson returns to England. The Moriarty gang are all convicted on the strength of evidence secured by Holmes. Watson ends his narrative by saying that Sherlock Holmes was the best and the wisest man he had ever known.  Background  The Final Problem was intended to be exactly what its name says. Conan Doyle meant to stop writing about his famous detective after this short story; he felt the Sherlock Holmes stories were distracting him from more serious literary efforts and that killing Holmes off was the only way of getting his career back on track. I must save my mind for better things, he wrote to his mother, even if it means I must bury my pocketbook with him. Conan Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having him rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous that any further task would be trivial in comparison; indeed, Holmes says as much in the story. In 1893, Conan Doyle and his wife toured Switzerland and discovered the village of Meiringen in the Bernese Alps. This experience fired Conan Doyle's imagination. In 1893 he wrote in his diary, which still exists, that he wanted to kill Sherlock Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls, says J rg Musfeld, director of the Park Hotel du Sauvage, where Conan Doyle is believed to have stayed during his visit to the village.  Publication history The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1893, and in the US in McClure's in the same month. It was also published in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in January 1894. It was published with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with eleven illustrations by Harry C. Edwards in McClure's. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.  Reaction In an article published by the BBC, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong noted that The public reaction to the death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events. The Strand Magazine barely survived the resulting rush of subscription cancellations. There were some stories that young men throughout London wore black mourning cr pes on their hats or around their arms for the month of Holmes death although these may have been exaggerations propounded by Doyle's son. Armstrong continues, Readers typically accepted what went on in their favourite books, then moved on. Now they were beginning to take their popular culture personally, and to expect their favourite works to conform to certain expectations. Pressure from fans eventually persuaded Doyle to bring Holmes back, writing The Hound of the Baskervilles and reviving him in The Adventure of the Empty House . There were enough holes in eyewitness accounts to allow Doyle to plausibly resurrect Holmes; only the few free surviving members of Moriarty's organisation and Holmes' brother Mycroft know that Sherlock Holmes is still alive, having won the struggle at the Reichenbach Falls and sent Moriarty to his doom though nearly meeting his own at the hands of one of Moriarty's henchmen.  Influence and legacy  Inhabitants of Meiringen are still grateful to Doyle and Holmes for ensuring the enduring worldwide fame of their falls and considerably promoting tourism to the town. A museum dedicated to Holmes is housed in the basement of the English Church, located in what has now been named Conan Doyle Place. At the funicular station near the falls, there is a memorial plate to the most famous detective in the world .The actual ledge from which Moriarty fell is on the other side of the falls. It is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge, and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque written in English, German, and French. The English inscription reads At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891. It is also marked by a large cross so as to be visible from the viewing platform. Fans who call themselves pilgrims travel to Meiringen dressed as characters, both major and minor, from the Holmes stories. There, they take part in a reenactment of the events of The Final Problem organized by the Sherlock Holmes Society of London.  Adaptations   Film  The Final Problem was adapted as a 1923 silent short film as part of the Stoll film series, starring Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Percy Standing as Moriarty.The 1931 film The Sleeping Cardinal, the first film in the 1931 1937 film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, is based in part on The Adventure of the Empty House and The Final Problem. The scene from The Final Problem in which Moriarty confronts Holmes at Baker Street and attempts to persuade Holmes to stop his investigations is used in The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes , another film in the series. In the 1939 1946 film series starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, a number of films borrow elements from The Final Problem . Most noticeable of these elements are the methods of killing Moriarty off; in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon and The Woman in Green , Moriarty is seen in all three films falling from a great height to his death. The Woman in Green contains a variation on the conversation between Holmes and Moriarty in Baker Street, as well as the idea of Moriarty manipulating Watson out of the way by hoaxing an injured Englishwoman who requires his treating. The 2011 film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is based in part on The Final Problem . Like the story, it ends with Holmes and Moriarty plummeting into the falls, and Watson is shown writing the final sentences of The Final Problem on his typewriter. However, in the film, the characters are attending a European Peace Conference held near the falls which Moriarty seeks to sabotage, and the two plunge down from a balcony overlooking the falls rather than from the ledge of the original story. Holmes is also shown falling over the edge with Moriarty rather than simply being assumed to have fallen, being too injured to defeat Moriarty in a straight fight but knowing that Moriarty will go after Watson if he lives. While Holmes is shown to have survived, having used his brother's oxygen inhaler to survive the water at the bottom of the falls, Moriarty's fate is less certain.  Television  The Soviet television film series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson adapted The Final Problem as The Deadly Fight . In the television series Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett, the 1985 episode based on the story begins with the theft of the Mona Lisa, masterminded by Moriarty in order to sell prepared fakes to collectors. Holmes recovers the original painting just before Moriarty makes a sale to a Mr. Morgan . Holmes's interference with his plans convinces Moriarty that the detective must be eliminated, and Holmes is subsequently presumed to have died in a tumble down the Reichenbach Falls. This was the last episode to star David Burke as Dr. Watson. Burke was replaced by Edward Hardwicke until the end of the show's run, starting with the adaptation of The Empty House which acted as the first episode of The Return of Sherlock Holmes. The BraveStarr episode Sherlock Holmes in the 23rd Century begins with a revised version of the climax of The Final Problem , in which only Holmes plummets down Reichenbach Falls, but instead of falling to his doom, he falls into a natural time warp that transports him into the year 2249. The first episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century begins with the climax of The Final Problem where it was later revealed in the second episode that while Holmes managed to survive the fall by grabbing a tree branch and would go on to solve many more cases , Moriarty had indeed parished and was buried by Holmes himself, preserved in ice in a freezing cave. Holmes, the robotic Watson and Inspector Beth Lestrade later visit the burial site at Reichenbach Falls to confirm Moriarty's death upon news of a lookalike causing a crime spree in New London. Upon seeing a drill hole in the ice, Holmes surmises that the new Moriarty is in fact a clone with all the original's memories and skills. The two part six season finale of Monk, Mr. Monk is on the Run , is loosely inspired by both The Final Problem and The Empty House. Adrian Monk is supposedly shot over a pier after being accused of murder, only to be alive in the second part. The orchestrator is revealed to be Dale the Whale Biederbeck, described as the Genghis Khan of world finance, much like Moriarty as the Napoleon of Crime. A variation on the scene in which Moriarty confronts Holmes at Baker Street is used in The Great Game , the third episode of the BBC television series Sherlock. The story is also the basis of The Reichenbach Fall , the third episode of the second season of the TV series Sherlock, which first aired on 15 January 2012 and shows Holmes falling from the roof of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, supposedly leading to his death. Throughout a confrontation between Sherlock and Jim Moriarty in Baker Street, Moriarty repeatedly utters the phrase the final problem . The special episode of Sherlock, The Abominable Bride , which was broadcast on 1 January 2016, featured a re creation of the showdown between Sherlock and Moriarty set in Victorian times, as depicted in the book. The 2017 series finale of Sherlock is named for this story, but bears little resemblance to the canon story. The 2012 series finale of the American medical drama House which was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories sees Dr. Gregory House fake his own death, in an ode to The Final Problem .The 2013 Russian television series Sherlock Holmes adapted The Final Problem as Holmes' Last Case . The 2018 HBO Asia Hulu Japan series Miss Sherlock loosely adapts this story for its series finale The Dock. In this version, the famous scene at the Reichenbach Falls is replaced by an analogous scene set at a fictional Reichenbach Building in Tokyo. The 2019 penultimate episode of the CBS adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, Elementary, was named Reichenbach Falls , and portrayed Sherlock's ploy to bring down a powerful serial killer billionaire, Odin Reichenbach.  Radio  The Final Problem was loosely adapted for multiple episodes of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson, including episodes titled Murder in the Waxworks , The Adventure of the Ace of Spades , and Murder by Proxy .The story was later adapted for radio by John Kier Cross; it was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in December 1954 and starred John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Dr. Watson, with Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty. The production was also broadcast on NBC radio on 17 April 1955.Felix Felton adapted the story as a radio adaptation which aired on the BBC Home Service in March 1955 as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Ralph Truman as Moriarty. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Felton aired on the BBC Home Service in November 1957, again starring Hobbs and Shelley, with Felton playing Moriarty. Hobbs and Shelley also starred as Holmes and Watson in a 1967 BBC Light Programme adaptation of the story which was adapted by Michael Hardwick. The Final Problem was dramatized for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Pennington as Professor Moriarty, Frederick Treves as Colonel Moran, Sean Arnold as Inspector Patterson, Terence Edmond as Steiler, Richard Pearce as Jenkinson, and Norman Jones as Sir George.An episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, combined The Final Problem with the events of The Empty House . The episode, titled The Return of Sherlock Holmes , aired in 2009, and starred John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Other media  William Gillette's 1899 stage play Sherlock Holmes is based on several stories, among them The Final Problem. Films released in 1916 and 1922 , both titled Sherlock Holmes, were based on the play, as well as a 1938 Mercury Theatre on the Air radio adaptation titled The Immortal Sherlock Holmes, starring Orson Welles as Holmes, although in none of these retellings do Holmes die .In 1975, DC Comics published Sherlock Holmes 1, a comic book which adapted both The Final Problem and The Adventure of the Empty House . It was intended to be an ongoing series, but future issues were canceled due to low sales. The 1999 comic series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill briefly adapts The Final Problem in issue 5 and shows Holmes triumphing over Moriarty and climbing the cliff, although Moriarty survives as well. The film adaptation references these events, but does not show them; the novelization copies the event almost verbatim from the graphic novel. An arc of the Japanese manga series Moriarty the Patriot, a series featuring a young Moriarty as a crime consultant, is named after the Japanese translation of the story's title. The final two episodes, The Final Problem Act 1 and The Final Problem Act 2 , feature Sherlock and William falling from Tower Bridge to River Thames, though revealed that both of them are alive and in Switzerland.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Empty House , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in Collier's in the United States on 26 September 1903, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in October 1903.Public pressure forced Conan Doyle to bring the sleuth back to life, and explain his apparently miraculous survival after his deadly struggle with Professor Moriarty in The Final Problem. This is the first Holmes story set after his supposed death at the Reichenbach Falls, as recounted in The Final Problem. The Hound of the Baskervilles had seen the return of a pre Reichenbach Falls Sherlock Holmes, which whetted readers' appetites. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Empty House sixth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.  Plot The story takes place in 1894, three years after the apparent death of Sherlock Holmes. On the night of March 30, an apparently unsolvable locked room murder takes place in London: the killing of the Honourable Ronald Adair, son of the Earl of Maynooth, a colonial governor in Australia. Adair was in his sitting room, working on accounts of some kind, as indicated by the papers and money found by police. He liked playing whist and regularly did so at several clubs, but never for great sums of money. It does, however, come out that he won as much as 420 in partnership with Colonel Sebastian Moran. The motive does not appear to be robbery as nothing has been stolen, and it seems that Adair had not an enemy in the world. It seems odd that Adair's door was locked from the inside. The only other way out was the open window, and there was a 20 foot drop below it onto a flower bed, which shows no sign of being disturbed. Adair was killed with a soft nosed revolver bullet to the head. No one in the area at the time heard a shot. In April, Dr. Watson , having retained an interest in crime from his previous association with Holmes, visits the murder scene at 427 Park Lane. He sees a plainclothes detective there with police, and also runs into an elderly deformed book collector, knocking several of his books to the ground. The encounter ends with the man snarling in anger and going away. However, that is not the last that Watson sees of him, for a short time later, the man comes to Watson's study in Kensington to apologize for his earlier behaviour. Once he manages to distract Watson's attention for a few seconds, he transforms himself into Sherlock Holmes, astonishing Watson so much that he faints to the ground for the first and last time in my life. Contrary to what Watson believed, Holmes won against Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls, flinging him down the waterfall with the help of baritsu, the Japanese system of wrestling, and then climbing up the cliff beside the path to make it appear as though he, too, had fallen to his death. This was a plan that Holmes had just conceived to defend against Moriarty's confederates. However, at least one of them knew that he was still alive and tried to kill him by dropping rocks down on the ledge where he had taken refuge. Hurriedly climbing back down the cliff and falling the last short distance to the path Holmes ran for his life and, by the next week, he was in Florence. Holmes apologizes to Watson for the deception needed to outwit his enemies, and describes his three years' exploits, explaining that he spent the next few years traveling to various parts of the world. First, he went to Tibet and wandered for two years, even attaining entry to Lhasa and met the head lama . Afterward, Holmes travelled incognito as a Norwegian explorer named Sigerson. Then, he went to Persia, with Holmes entering Mecca, and then to a brief stopover with the Khalifa in Khartoum. Finally, before returning, Holmes spent time doing chemical research on coal tar derivatives in Montpellier, France. However, Holmes was finally brought back to London by the news of Adair's murder. During all this time, the only people who knew that Holmes was alive were Moriarty's henchmen and Holmes's brother Mycroft, who provided him with the money he needed. Holmes tells Watson that they are going to do some dangerous work that evening, and after a roundabout trip through the city they enter an empty house, an abandoned building known as Camden House whose front room overlooks to Watson's great surprise Baker Street. Holmes's room can be seen across the street, and more surprisingly still, Holmes can be seen silhouetted against the blind: it is a lifelike waxwork bust, moved regularly from below by Mrs. Hudson to simulate life. Holmes employs the dummy because he was seen by one of Moriarty's men, and thus he expects an attempt on his life that very night. Holmes and Watson wait two hours until approximately midnight in the abandoned Camden House. A sniper, who has taken the bait, fires a specialized air gun to assassinate his foe. Surprisingly, he chooses Camden House as his vantage point. Once the ruffian shoots his air gun, scoring a direct hit on Holmes's dummy across the street, Holmes and Watson are on him, and he is soon disarmed and restrained. While Watson knocks down the enemy, Holmes summons the police by blowing a whistle. They are led by Inspector Lestrade, who arrests the gunman. It is none other than Colonel Moran, Adair's whist partner, and the same man who threw rocks down on the ledge at Holmes at Reichenbach Falls. Holmes does not wish the police to press charges of attempted murder in connection with what Moran has just done. Instead, he tells Lestrade to charge him with actual murder, for Moran is the man who murdered Adair. The air gun, it turns out, has been specially designed to shoot revolver bullets, and a quick forensics check of the one that killed his dummy shows, as Holmes expected, that it matches the bullet used to kill Adair. Holmes and Watson then go to their old apartment in Baker Street, where Holmes' rooms were kept as he had left them thanks to Mycroft's supervision. Moran's motive in killing Adair is a matter of speculation even for Holmes. Nonetheless, his theory is that Adair had caught Moran cheating at cards, and threatened to expose his dishonourable behaviour. Moran therefore got rid of the one man who could rob him of his livelihood, for he earned a living playing cards crookedly, and could ill afford to be barred from all his clubs.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Empty House was published in the US in Collier's on 26 September 1903, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October 1903. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  This story was adapted as a short film released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.The 1931 film The Sleeping Cardinal is loosely based on The Adventure of the Empty House and The Final Problem . Many elements of The Adventure of the Empty House were used in the 1939 1946 Sherlock Holmes film series starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. In Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon , Holmes disguises himself as a German bookseller in Switzerland. The Woman in Green uses the scene in which a sniper attempts to shoot Holmes from across the street and shoots a wax bust instead, and is apprehended by Holmes and Watson who lie in wait. Colonel Sebastian Moran appears as the villain in Terror by Night as the last of Moriarty's gang. The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in... starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Bill Owen as Inspector Lestrade. The episode is now lost.The story was adapted in 1980 as an episode of the Soviet TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson starring Vasily Livanov. The episode has some minor departures: Moran tries to shoot Holmes during his fight with Moriarty , with Holmes pretending to be hit to fake his death, Adair is still alive at the start of the episode, Watson unsuccessfully tries to protect him as instructed by Holmes, and Watson briefly becomes a prime suspect in Adair's murder.The story was later adapted in 1986 as an episode of The Return of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett. The episode is rather faithful to Doyle's story, except that Moran tries to shoot Holmes in Switzerland instead of dropping boulders on him, and it is Watson not Holmes that deduces the reason that Moran had for killing Ronald Adair. It was the first episode to feature Edward Hardwicke as Dr Watson, replacing David Burke who had played the role in the preceding episodes . The Adventure of the Empty House was adapted as an episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. The episode, also titled The Adventure of the Empty House , first aired in 1999.In The Empty Hearse , the first episode of the third series of Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch which aired on 1 January 2014, Holmes returns to London two years after faking his death. Although Watson is surprised that Sherlock is alive, he is furious that Sherlock didn't contact him in the last two years. He reluctantly teams up with Sherlock to investigate an underground terrorist network.  Radio  Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 5 October 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 15 October 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 29 September 1940. Another episode in the same series that was also adapted from the story aired on 11 April 1948 .John Gielgud played Holmes with Ralph Richardson as Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on NBC radio on 24 April 1955.Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio production that aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1961, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Noel Johnson as Colonel Moran. The Empty House was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Pennington as Professor Moriarty, Frederick Treves as Colonel Moran, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and Peter Penry Jones as Sir John. The Adventure of the Empty House was combined with The Final Problem for an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode, titled The Return of Sherlock Holmes , first aired in 2009.  Other media  The story, along with The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax , The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton , and The Red Headed League , provided the source material for the 1923 play The Return of Sherlock Holmes. In 1975, DC Comics published Sherlock Holmes 1, a comic which adapted The Adventure of the Empty House and The Final Problem . It was intended to be an ongoing series, but future issues were cancelled due to low sales. In the last short story in the book Flashman and the Tiger by George MacDonald Fraser, Fraser's anti hero Harry Flashman sets out to murder Moran, who is blackmailing Flashman's granddaughter. He trails Moran to Camden House, but instead witnesses Holmes capture him.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder , one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the second tale from The Return of Sherlock Holmes. The story was first published in Collier's on 31 October 1903 and in The Strand Magazine in November 1903.  Plot Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by the unhappy John Hector McFarlane, a young lawyer from Blackheath who has been accused of murdering one of his clients, builder Jonas Oldacre. McFarlane explains to Holmes that Oldacre had come to his office only a day earlier and asked him to draw up his will in legal language. To his surprise, McFarlane saw that Oldacre was making him the sole beneficiary and even heir to a considerable bequest, and McFarlane cannot imagine why he would do so. That business took McFarlane to Oldacre's house in Lower Norwood, where some documents had to be examined for legal purposes and where the murder allegedly took place. McFarlane left quite late and stayed at a local inn. He claims to have read about the murder in the newspaper the next morning on the train. The paper said quite clearly that the police were looking for him. The evidence against the young McFarlane is quite damning. His stick has been found in Oldacre's room, and a fire was extinguished just outside in which a pile of dry timber burnt to ashes, complete with the smell of burnt flesh. It seems more than likely that McFarlane did the crime, especially as it is known that he was there around that time. Inspector Lestrade gloats in the apparent knowledge that he, unlike Holmes, is on the right track. Holmes begins his own investigation into the matter by going to Blackheath. This puzzles Lestrade, who had expected him to go first to Norwood. McFarlane's mother, Holmes finds out, was once engaged to Oldacre years earlier but later wanted nothing to do with the man once she found out how cruel he was: he had let a cat loose in a bird sanctuary. Upon examining the handwritten notes given to McFarlane by Oldacre to be rendered into legally acceptable language, Holmes reckons they were written in a very haphazard fashion as if the writer failed to care about what he was writing. The alternation between legible handwriting and incomprehensible squiggles suggests to Holmes that the will was written hurriedly on a train, with the legible writing representing stops at stations. Also, Oldacre's financial dealings are found to have been a bit odd. Several cheques for substantial amounts, for unknown reasons, have recently been made out to a Mr. Cornelius. The discovery of Oldacre's trouser buttons in the fire ashes does nothing to exonerate McFarlane. Holmes fears the worst; All my instincts are in one direction, and all the facts are in another. Still, Holmes has powers of observation that suggest Oldacre's housekeeper is deliberately withholding information. Lestrade's gloating reaches a peak when a bloody thumbprint is found at Oldacre's house that matches McFarlane's thumb. However, Holmes becomes quite sure that something very devious is afoot, as he had examined that part of the house only a day earlier, and the thumbprint was quite surely not there then. Because McFarlane has been in gaol since his arrest at 221B Baker Street, Holmes deduces that someone is attempting a deception. Holmes sets up a small fire in one room of the house with a little straw and tells three of Lestrade's constables to shout Fire! Lestrade and Watson are quite astonished at what happens next: Oldacre emerges alive from a hidden chamber at the end of a hallway, where Holmes has deduced it must be by measuring the corridors, and runs to escape the fire. Oldacre is immediately seized. It is revealed that McFarlane being accused of his murder had been part of a revenge campaign against the woman who rejected Oldacre years previously, the young mother of McFarlane. Oldacre tries to pass off his actions as a practical joke but is taken into custody, along with the housekeeper as an accomplice. Holmes lightly chaffs his rival for neglecting Blackheath, where he acquired the key information. As for Mr. Cornelius, the recipient of so much of Oldacre's munificence, Holmes deduces that it had likely been an alias used by Oldacre, who has been leading a double life with the eventual goal of shedding his Oldacre identity so that he would be able to start a new life. The bank account of Mr. Cornelius will be seized by Oldacre's creditors. Oldacre swears revenge against Holmes, who serenely dismisses the threats. Holmes remarks to Lestrade that Oldacre's plot was nearly perfect. Still, he went one step too far by planting the thumbprint , thinking it would create even more damning evidence, after Holmes had already examined the room where it was found. He wished to improve what was already perfect , says Holmes, and so he ruined everything.  Background Conan Doyle lived in South Norwood from 1891 to 1894, and so was very familiar with the area. There is however a good deal of ambiguity as to specific settings within the story. The Norwood where Oldacre lives for instance is called Lower Norwood , which until around 1885 would have been the term used for what is now West Norwood. The story however was penned some time after this date, and Oldacre is described as living in Deep Dene House, at the Sydenham end of the road of that name . South Norwood itself might be a logical candidate for Lower Norwood, however the only discernible connection between the story and South Norwood is that Norwood Junction railway station is used by Oldacre. McFarlane spends the night in The Anerley Arms, a pub that still exists and which has a derelict upper floor . It is now one of the Samuel Smith's family of pubs and celebrates its connection with Sherlock Holmes.This is one of the few Holmes stories in which a fingerprint provides a good clue to the nature of the problem. The wax thumbprint reproduction idea was devised by, and bought from, Bertram Fletcher Robinson , who also helped plot The Hound of the Baskervilles .At the start of the story, Watson mentions two unrecorded cases that Holmes investigated around the same time as this story: The case of the papers of Ex President Murillo , which Doyle later wrote as The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge . The shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland , which loosely inspired a 1944 episode of the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and the 1945 film Pursuit to Algiers, both starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes. A reference to Professor Moriarty prefaces the story. 'From the point of view of the criminal expert', said Mr Sherlock Holmes, 'London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Moriarty' . Moriarty is mentioned in two other 1903 stories: 'The Adventure of the Missing Three Quarter' and 'The Adventure of the Empty House'.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Norwood Builder was first published in the US in Collier's on 31 October 1903, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in November 1903. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a short silent film released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson, with Cyril Raymond as John McFarlane and Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins.The Granada Sherlock Holmes television series with Jeremy Brett was faithful to the original story with a few exceptions. In the adaptation, Oldacre kills and burns a tramp, but in the book, he refuses to admit what flesh was burned. Mrs. McFarlane is a recent widow instead of her husband being alive but away. Watson instead of Holmes traces payments to Cornelius, and finally, Holmes instead of Lestrade, warns McFarlane that his words may be used against him. In the first episode of season two of Elementary, Holmes mentions the Norwood Builder as a case he and Lestrade worked on in London.  Radio and audio dramas  A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 13 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 17 November 1940.Felix Felton adapted the story for the BBC Home Service as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Felton as Inspector Lestrade and John Turnbull as Jonas Oldacre. The adaptation aired on 7 October 1954.The story was adapted as an episode titled The Tale of the Norwood Builder in a series of radio adaptations starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on the BBC Light Programme on 23 November 1954 and NBC radio on 20 February 1955.An audio drama based on the story was released in 1971 on one side of an LP record, as one of several recordings starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick. The Norwood Builder was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules, as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Sallis as Jonas Oldacre, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and David Holt as John McFarlane. In it, because of his change of attitude towards fame , Holmes, at the beginning, informs Watson that there must be no more stories but that Watson should continue to keep notes on their cases to stockpile them for possible future publication. Also, after his capture, Oldacre reveals that he also believed Holmes to be dead. The story was adapted as a 2007 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Rick May as Lestrade.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Dancing Men is a Sherlock Holmes story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as one of 13 stories in the cycle published as The Return of Sherlock Holmes in 1905. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in December 1903, and in Collier's in the United States on 5 December 1903. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Dancing Men third in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories. This is one of only two Sherlock Holmes short stories where Holmes' client dies after seeking his help. The other is The Five Orange Pips , part of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes's solution to the riddle of the dancing men rests on reasoning that closely resembles that of Legrand in Poe's The Gold Bug. The original title was The Dancing Men, when it was published as a short story in The Strand Magazine in December 1903.  Plot The story begins when Hilton Cubitt of Ridling Thorpe Manor in Norfolk visits Sherlock Holmes and gives him a piece of paper with the following mysterious sequence of stick figures. Cubitt explains to Holmes and Dr. Watson that he has recently married an American woman named Elsie Patrick. Before the wedding, she had asked her husband to be never to ask about her past, as she had had some very disagreeable associations in her life, although she said that there was nothing that she was personally ashamed of. Their marriage had been a happy one until the messages began to arrive, first mailed from the United States and then appearing in the garden. The messages had made Elsie very afraid but she did not explain the reasons for her fear, and Cubitt insisted on honoring his promise not to ask about Elsie's life in the United States. Holmes examines all of the occurrences of the dancing figures, and they provide him with an important clue he realizes that they form a substitution cipher and cracks the code by frequency analysis. The last of the messages causes Holmes to fear that the Cubitts are in immediate danger. Holmes rushes to Riding Thorpe Manor and finds Cubitt dead of a bullet to the heart and his wife gravely wounded from a gunshot to the head. Inspector Martin of the Norfolk Constabulary believes that it is a murder suicide attempt; Elsie is the prime suspect. But Holmes, after noting some inconsistencies in that theory, proves that there is a third person involved. Holmes writes a message in dancing figure characters and has it delivered to a lodger at a nearby farm. While waiting for the result of this message, Holmes explains to Watson and Inspector Martin how he cracked the code of the dancing figures. The last message, which caused Holmes and Watson to rush to Norfolk, read ELSIE PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD . The lodger, Abe Slaney, another American, unaware that Elsie is gravely wounded, arrives at Ridling Thorpe Manor and is seized as he comes through the door. Holmes had sent for Slaney using the dancing men, knowing that Slaney would believe the message is from Elsie. Slaney reveals that he had been engaged to Elsie, the daughter of the Chicago crime boss whom Slaney works for, and that she had fled to escape her old life. Slaney had come to England to get her back. When Slaney and Elsie were speaking through a window, Cubitt had appeared and shots were exchanged; Cubitt was killed and Slaney had fled. Apparently, Elsie then shot herself. Slaney is arrested and sentenced to hang, but his sentence is reduced to penal servitude because Cubitt had fired the first shot. Elsie recovers from her injuries, and spends her life helping the poor and administering her late husband's estate.  Publication history The story was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1903, and in the US in Collier's on 5 December 1903. It was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  Eille Norwood starred as Holmes in a 1923 short film adapted from the story as part of the Stoll film series. The 1943 film Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes, is credited as an adaptation of The Dancing Men, but the only element of Doyle's story to be used is the dancing men code. The plot involves Holmes and Professor Moriarty, in a World War II setting, racing to find the pieces of a new bomb sight. The Dancing Men was adapted for the second episode of the second season of the 1965 68 TV series Sherlock Holmes starring Peter Cushing as Holmes. The Dancing Men was adapted for the second episode of the 1984 TV series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett. In this adaptation, the location of Ridling Thorpe Manor is moved from Norfolk to Derbyshire. The Dancing Men inspired the eleventh episode of the 1999 animated TV series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. The Adventure of Henry Baskerville and a Dog , an episode of the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes is based on Hound of the Baskervilles and The Dancing Men . In it, Holmes deciphers the code found in the school in parallel with investigating the real figure of Monster Dog . In the BBC television series Sherlock: The Dancing Men inspired the second episode of series 1, entitled The Blind Banker , where ciphers are a prominent feature. The Dancing Men case itself is directly portrayed at the end of the third and final episode of series 4, entitled The Final Problem , where the identical AM HERE ABE SLANEY cipher is shown. In the 2018 movie Batman: Gotham by Gaslight, Bruce, while preparing to escape prison, smuggles out a note written in the Dancing Men code. While containing mistakes, it appears to be a legitimate message asking Alfred to prepare his gear and transport.  Radio  A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 20 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 9 May 1936 . Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 1 December 1940. Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a radio adaptation which aired on BBC Radio 2 in June 1969 as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with John Bentley as Abe Slaney. The Dancing Men was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Tuddenham as Inspector Martin and Christopher Good as Hilton Cubitt. The story was adapted as a 2007 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Stephan Weyte as Hilton Cubitt and Frank Buxton as Inspector Martin.

It was first published in Collier's in the United States on 26 December 1903, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in January 1904.  Plot  Holmes is contacted by Miss Violet Smith of Farnham, Surrey about an unusual turn in her and her mother's lives. Violet's father has recently died and left his wife and daughter rather poor. There was an ad in the news asking about their whereabouts. Answering it, they met Mr. Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, the former a pleasant enough man, but the latter a bullying churl. They had come from South Africa, where they had known Violet's uncle Ralph Smith, who had now also died in poverty and apparently wanted to see that his relatives were provided for. This struck Violet as odd, since she and her family had not heard a word from Smith since his departure for South Africa 25 years ago. Carruthers and Woodley explained that before dying, Ralph had heard of his brother's death and felt responsible for his survivors' welfare. Carruthers began by offering Violet a job as a live in music teacher for his ten year old daughter at 100 a year, about twice the going rate. She accepted after Carruthers said that she could visit her mother on weekends. That went well until Mr. Woodley came to stay for a week. He made the most oafish and clumsy sexual advances to her, and boasted that if Violet married him she would have a life of luxury. He even grabbed her and demanded a kiss, precipitating expulsion by his host, Carruthers. Violet has not seen Woodley since. The specific thing that has brought Violet to seek Holmes's services, however, is the strange man who follows her on his bicycle as she cycles to and from the railway station for her weekend visits to her mother. The strange man always keeps his distance behind her and disappears without a trace, never letting her near him, and always along the same lonely stretch of road. Violet does not recognize him, but he has a black beard. Holmes asks her about her admirers, and other than Woodley, if he can be styled as such, she can only think of Mr. Carruthers, who, although a perfect gentleman at all times, seems attracted to her. After Violet leaves, Holmes observes that it is odd that a household would pay 100 a year for a music teacher but be too cheap to pay for a horse and trap. He sends Dr. Watson to Surrey to see what he can find out. This turns out to be virtually nothing, except to establish that the lady's story is true, and that the mystery man comes out of and goes back into a local house, Charlington Hall. Holmes upbraids Watson for his lackluster results. They also receive a letter from Violet that evening saying that Carruthers has proposed to her, but she had to refuse since she is already engaged to a man named Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer in Coventry. Holmes goes to Surrey himself, and gets into a fight in a pub for his troubles; when he returns and tells Watson what happened, he actually considers his experience in Surrey to be hilarious. It seems that Mr. Woodley was in the taproom at the pub and heard his name mentioned in conversation. He came out and demanded to know who Holmes was and what he wanted. The discussion escalated to violence; Holmes emerged with a few bruises, whereas Woodley had to be carried home. The innkeeper merely mentioned that Woodley is a regular weekend guest at Charlington Hall, which is rented by Williamson, who, rumor has it, is a clergyman. Holmes returns to 221B Baker Street with his face somewhat marred, and another letter arrives from Violet, saying that her situation has become impossible owing to Mr. Carruthers's proposals, and Mr. Woodley's reappearance. She is quitting. Holmes knows that some intrigue is afoot, and he tells Watson that they must get themselves to Surrey to see that Violet makes it to the station. Carruthers has at last acquired a trap, and she need not ride her bicycle this time. Failing to realize that Violet might take an earlier train than usual, Holmes discovers that he is too late to meet Violet. The trap comes along the road, but by the time it does, no one is in it: Violet has been abducted. Holmes and Watson board the empty trap in an attempt to go after the kidnappers. They come face to face with the mysterious cyclist, who pulls a revolver on them; however, both parties quickly realise that they are on the same side both have Violet's welfare in mind. The cyclist declares that the abductors are Woodley and Williamson. He evidently knows something of the intrigue. The group first find an unconscious groom, who was driving the trap, in the bushes, and then they find all three persons that they have been seeking on the Charlington Hall grounds, with the apparently defrocked clergyman performing a wedding ceremony between the other two. The bride is somewhat unwilling, judging from the gag over her mouth. Woodley's boast of having married Violet leads the mysterious cyclist, unmasking himself as Carruthers, to pull out his revolver and shoot Woodley, wounding him. The intrigue does indeed involve Uncle Ralph in South Africa. He was dying when Carruthers and Woodley left; far from being penniless at his death, it is revealed that in reality, Uncle Ralph had amassed a large fortune. As he was illiterate, he would surely die intestate, and therefore Violet would inherit his wealth as Ralph's next of kin. The two crooks made their way to England in the hopes that one of them would get to marry Violet Woodley having won the chance in a card game on the ship and they had to draw Williamson into the plot, promising him a share of the lucre. The plan went awry when first, Woodley proved to be a brute, and next, Carruthers fell in love with Violet, and thereafter wanted nothing to do with his former confederates. He took to disguising himself and following her as she rode her bicycle past Charlington Hall, where he knew Woodley and Williamson might be lying in wait for her. Heavy penalties await Woodley and Williamson, but Carruthers only gets a few months due to Woodley's less than savory reputation. Holmes reassures Carruthers the marriage performed by Williamson was void; not only was it performed against Violet's will, but Williamson had been unfrocked and therefore had no authority to legalise a marriage.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist was published in the US in Collier's on 26 December 1903, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1904. The story was published with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.The first version of the story was refused by the editor of The Strand Magazine because Holmes was not very involved in the plot.Conan Doyle was not very pleased with the story and believed that the first three stories of The Return of Sherlock Holmes were better than this story. He also commits a lapse in the narrative when he explicitly mentions Violet Smith's visit to Holmes occurring on Saturday, April 23, 1895; the 23rd of April that year fell on a Tuesday.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a 1921 short silent film in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.The Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett was relatively faithful to the original story; however, it has a comic relief ending when Holmes's chemical experiment causes the flat to fill up with smoke, and brings the fire brigade to the scene.   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 27 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 20 June 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 26 October 1941.John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on 30 November 1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The production also aired on NBC radio on 27 February 1955.Michael Hardwick adapted the story for the BBC Light Programme as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It aired in 1964.An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell. The Solitary Cyclist was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and features Denis Quilley as Bob Carruthers, Susannah Harker as Violet Smith, David Holt as Jack Woodley, and Peter Penry Jones as Williamson.The story was adapted as a 2015 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Priory School , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in Collier's in the United States on 30 January 1904, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in February 1904. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Priory School tenth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.  Plot  Holmes receives a visit from Dr. Thorneycroft Huxtable, the founder and principal of a preparatory school called Priory School in Northern England. He beseeches Holmes to come back to Mackleton with him to look into the disappearance of one of his pupils, the ten year old Lord Saltire, whose father is the very rich and famous Duke of Holdernesse. Huxtable explains that not only the boy has disappeared, but also the German master, Heidegger, along with his bicycle. Once in the North, the Duke says to Holmes that he does not think that his estranged wife has anything to do with his son's disappearance, nor has there been a ransom demand. Holmes establishes that the boy and his kidnappers could not have used the nearby road without being seen, suggesting that they went cross country. As if to confirm this, the police find the boy's school cap in some gypsies' possession. They swear that they simply found it on the moor, but the police lock them up. Holmes and Dr. Watson go hunting for clues. They find a bicycle track, but it is not Heidegger's; it does not match his tyres. Holmes observes that one tyre has a patch on it. Almost everything observable has been obliterated by cow tracks . Eventually, Heidegger's bicycle tracks are found, and they end where he lies, dead. After that, Holmes and Watson arrive at the Fighting Cock Inn, and meet the innkeeper, Reuben Hayes, who seems startled indeed to hear that Holmes wants to go to Holdernesse Hall, the Duke's nearby house, to tell him news of his son. The two men have lunch there, and Holmes suddenly realises that he and Watson saw many cow tracks out on the moor, but never at any time did they see any cows. Furthermore, the patterns of the hoof prints were quite unusual, suggesting that the cow in question trotted, cantered, and galloped. Holmes and Watson sneak out to Hayes's stable and examine the horse's hooves. As Holmes has expected, there is evidence of recent shoeing, but with old shoes and new nails. Examining the nearby smithy, Holmes and Watson are rather belligerently asked to leave by Mr. Hayes. Shortly afterwards, the two men hide as a cyclist comes along the road from the direction of the Duke's. It is James Wilder, the Duke's personal secretary, and he looks agitated. He arrives at the inn. Soon afterwards, a trap pulls out of the stable yard and goes along the road towards Chesterfield. A while later, someone else it is getting dark and only a fleeting glimpse of the new visitor is caught arrives at the inn. Coming closer, Holmes observes Wilder's bicycle tyres and notes that they are the same make as the first ones encountered on the moor. The next morning, they go to Holdernesse Hall, where they find that the Duke is not well. Nevertheless, Holmes demands from him a cheque for 6000 , saying that he has earned the reward. His son is at the Fighting Cock, and the accused is the Duke himself, but the actual mastermind of this crime is James Wilder, who has a terrible secret: He is the illegitimate son of the Duke. He conceived a plan to kidnap Lord Saltire to force the Duke to change his will, knowing very well that his father would not call the police on him, as he abhorred the very idea of scandal. The plan began to unravel when Wilder hired Hayes who has now fled, but been caught on Holmes's information to do the actual kidnapping. Hayes killed Heidegger, and when Wilder heard the news, he confessed all to his father. So anxious was the Duke to avoid scandal, he agreed to let his younger son stay at the inn for another three days, and to keep quiet, so that Hayes could flee justice. All ends well, except for Hayes, who faces the gallows. Lord Saltire is brought home from the inn and the Duke writes to his estranged wife asking her to reconcile with him. This he feels she will be willing to do, for the source of the friction between them is going away: James Wilder is being packed off to Australia to seek his fortune. As for the cow tracks, they were accomplished by shoeing the horses with special shoes shaped like cow's hooves. The shoes were from the Duke's collection of family memorabilia.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Priory School was published in the US in Collier's on 30 January 1904, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in February 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with nine illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  A silent short film based on the story was released in 1921 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. Eille Norwood played Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis played Dr. Watson.The story was dramatised as part of the Granada TV Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett. Set in 1887, however, the ending was changed. In the dramatisation, Wilder takes Lord Saltire as a hostage in a chase led by Holmes, the Duke of Holdernesse, and Watson through a cavern under the moor, known as the Cathedral . Having climbed to the top of a cliff like structure with the boy, Wilder slips and falls to his death, while Lord Saltire is rescued. Also, in this version, the Duke volunteers a reward of 6,000 early on, but in the end writes Holmes a cheque for 12,000 .

            "text": "The Adventure of Black Peter is a Sherlock Holmes story by Arthur Conan Doyle. This tale is in the collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes. It was originally published in Collier's in February 1904 and in The Strand Magazine in March 1904.  Plot  Forest Row in the Weald is the scene of a harpoon murder, and a young police inspector, Stanley Hopkins, asks Holmes, whom he admires, for help. Holmes has already determined that it would take a great deal of strength and skill to run a man through with a harpoon and embed it in the wall behind him. Peter Carey, the 50 year old victim and former master of the Sea Unicorn of Dundee, who lived with his wife and daughter, had a reputation for being violent. Carey did not sleep in the family house, but in a small cottage that he built some distance from the house, whose interior he had decorated to look like a sailor's cabin on a ship. This is where he was found harpooned. Hopkins could find no footprints or other physical evidence. However, a tobacco pouch made of sealskin and with the initials P.C. was found at the scene, which was full of strong ship's tobacco. This is rather unusual, as Peter Carey or Black Peter as people called him seldom smoked. Indeed, Hopkins found no pipe in the cabin. Carey was found fully dressed, suggesting that he was expecting a visitor, and there was some rum laid out along with two dirty glasses. There were brandy and whisky, too, but neither had been touched. There was also a knife in its sheath at Carey's feet; Mrs. Carey has identified it as her husband's. A little notebook was also found at the scene. It contains the initials J. H. N. and the year 1883. It also says C. P. R. on the second page, which Holmes reckons stands for Canadian Pacific Railway. The first set of initials is likely a stockbroker's, as the little book is full of what appears to be stock exchange information. Holmes decides to accompany Hopkins to Forest Row, and upon arrival, Hopkins observes that someone has tried to break into Carey's cabin, but failed. After examining the inside of the cabin, Holmes deduces from the lack of dust that something has been taken from a shelf, even though the burglar did not get in. The stolen item was a book, or possibly a box. Holmes believes that the burglar will likely try again, this time bringing a more useful tool for the job. So, Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Hopkins all lie in wait for the burglar that night, and they are not disappointed. Along he comes, he breaks into the cabin, and goes through one of Carey's old logbooks, cursing when he finds that the information that he wants is missing, having been torn out of the book. As he is leaving the cabin, Hopkins moves in and arrests him. He is John Hopley Neligan which matches the initials in the notebook the son of a long vanished, failed banker. He claims he was looking at Carey's logs to test a theory of his. His father disappeared with a box full of securities after his bank failed. He took them on a yacht bound for Norway. He believes that his father's boat may have been driven north on the North Sea by bad weather, and met the Sea Unicorn, captained by Carey. He believes that Carey knew something about his father's disappearance, and that possibly his father was murdered by the man who has now himself become a murder victim as he has traced some of his father's long lost securities back to Carey. Hopkins takes Neligan off to the station, even though Neligan swears that he has nothing to do with the murder. Holmes believes this to be true, because Neligan is a slight, anemic thin man, hardly capable of running a man through with a harpoon. Holmes saves Neligan from the noose by finding the true killer in a most unusual way. He advertises for a harpooner, posing as a sea captain named Basil. He gets three applicants at 221B Baker Street for the job, and one of them is indeed Peter Carey's killer, as confirmed by his name, Patrick Cairns, and the fact that Holmes had established that he was once Carey's shipmate. Holmes also felt sure that a murderer would want to leave the country for a while. Holmes handcuffs the unaware Cairns after which Cairns confesses. While he freely admits to killing Carey, he furiously denies that it was murder, claiming self defence. He was actually at Carey's cabin to extort hush money from him. Neligan's father had indeed come aboard the Sea Unicorn with his tin box of securities, and Carey had murdered him by throwing him overboard while he believed no one was looking, though Cairns had witnessed the event. While Carey initially had agreed to the payoff, when Cairns came to collect, things were different. The two drank together, during which Carey's mood darkened. When Carey reached for his knife, which Cairns viewed as a threat, he took action. Cairns then examined the box of securities, but finding them impossible for him to sell, escaped, leaving his tobacco pouch on the table. The rum was another clue. Holmes was sure that it, and the fact that the brandy and whiskey had been left alone, were sure signs that the killer was a seaman. Neligan is released and the securities returned to him, although the ones that Carey sold cannot be recovered.  Publication history  The Adventure of Black Peter was published in the US in Collier's on 27 February 1904, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  A silent short film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, with Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins, Hugh Buckler as Patrick Cairns, and Fred Paul as Captain Peter Carey.The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost.There is a visual reference to the Black Peter storyline in The Hounds of Baskerville , the second episode of the second season of the BBC series Sherlock . The first episode of the 2013 Russian TV series Sherlock Holmes is based on the story. In March 2017, the US TV series Elementary used the Black Peter story as the basis for an episode called Dead Man's Tale . The plot of the episode is driven by the search for the treasure of a pirate named Black Peter. The murder victim is impaled with a sword, and, like in the short story, a suspect named Neligan is judged as being innocent due to lacking the strength to impale the victim.  Radio and audio dramas  A radio adaptation of The Adventure of Black Peter , dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 11 May 1931 in the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 8 December 1940.

            "text": "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was originally published in Collier's in the United States on 26 March 1904, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in April 1904. It is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes .  Timeline According to William S. Baring Gould's timeline of the Sherlock Holmes canon, the events of Milverton occurred in 1899. Leslie S. Klinger also placed the story in 1899 in his timeline of the canon. This was nine years after the strange death of Charles Augustus Howell, the real life inspiration for the character of Milverton .  Plot  Holmes is hired by the d butante Lady Eva Blackwell to retrieve compromising letters from a blackmailer: Milverton, who causes Holmes more revulsion than any of the 50 odd murderers in his career. Milverton is the king of blackmailers . He demands 7,000 for the letters, which if given to third parties would cause a scandal that would end Lady Eva's marriage engagement. Holmes offers 2,000, all Lady Eva can pay, but Milverton insists on 7,000. It is worth 7,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more open to reason and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not. Holmes resolves to recover the letters by whatever means necessary, as Milverton has placed himself outside the bounds of morality. Holmes visits Milverton's Hampstead house, disguised as a plumber, in order to learn the plan of the house and Milverton's daily routine. He cultivates the acquaintance of Milverton's housemaid and even becomes engaged to marry her. This rather shocks Watson, but Holmes assures him that he has a hated rival who will step in when the plumber disappears. Holmes has learned where Milverton keeps his blackmail papers , and plans to burgle Milverton's house that night. Watson comes along. They break into the study, but just as Holmes opens the safe, Milverton enters the study, even though he should be in bed asleep. Holmes and Watson hide behind a curtain, while Milverton has a midnight meeting with a supposed maidservant offering to sell letters that would compromise her mistress. The woman is actually one of Milverton's former victims, whose broken hearted husband died when she wouldn't pay Milverton and he revealed her secret. Now she avenges her husband by shooting Milverton to death, then stamps on his face. Watson instinctively begins to rush out and stop the shooting, but Holmes restrains him. Holmes understands, and Watson instantly realises, that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain... The woman runs away, and Milverton's household is roused by the shots. During his final confrontation, Milverton's entire cache of blackmail papers had been in a safe with its door slightly ajar. Holmes now feeds this mass of compromising material into Milverton's burning fireplace, despite the risk of being discovered and caught. Then Holmes and Watson escape through the garden and over the wall. Watson has to kick himself free from a pursuer who has grabbed his leg. The next morning, Inspector Lestrade calls at Baker Street to ask for Holmes' help in investigating Milverton's murder, which he ascribes to the two burglars seen escaping over the garden wall. He has a description of one of them: a middle aged, strongly built man square jaw, thick neck, moustache... Holmes calls that vague. Why, it might be a description of Watson! he says, which amuses Lestrade. But Holmes refuses Lestrade's request: My sympathies are with the criminals, and I will not handle the case. Later, Holmes recognises the face of the woman who killed Milverton. He shows Watson her photograph displayed in a shop window among those of other celebrities. Watson recognises the name of her famous husband, but Holmes signals silence with a finger to his lips. Watson assures his readers that the killer in question is beyond the reach of the law i.e deceased and that certain details have been disguised to hurt no one.  Inspiration The character of Charles Augustus Milverton was based on a real blackmailer, Charles Augustus Howell. He was an art dealer who preyed upon an unknown number of people, including the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti.Doyle's literary inspiration often came from his natural interest in crime, and he had no tolerance for predators. Howell died in 1890 in circumstances as strange as any of Doyle's novels: His body was found near a Chelsea public house with his throat posthumously slit, with a half Sovereign coin in his mouth. The presence of the coin was known to be a criticism of those guilty of slander. The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton was also inspired by the A. J. Raffles short story Wilful Murder by E. W. Hornung, according to Richard Lancelyn Green.  Publication history  The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton was published in the US in Collier's on 26 March 1904, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a short silent film titled Charles Augustus Milverton in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.The 1932 film The Missing Rembrandt, part of the 1931 1937 film series starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes, was loosely based on the story.The story was faithfully adapted in the 1965 BBC series Sherlock Holmes with Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, and Barry Jones as Milverton. The only difference from the story is the identity of Milverton's killer. The Soviet television film series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson featured the case under the name The King of Blackmail . It was the first of the three episodes concerning Professor Moriarty. Apparently, Milverton was a member of the gang, since certain papers were recovered from his office which helped implicate the Professor. The husband of the lady who kills Milverton is stated to be named Lord Christopher Huxley, aged 42, with Holmes reading an article about his death at the beginning of the episode. Holmes approaches the lady later to obtain the aforementioned papers which she took with her. Otherwise, it is faithful to the original. The story was much extrapolated when adapted by screenwriter Jeremy Paul for Granada Television series Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett. It became the 1992 feature length episode The Master Blackmailer and featured Robert Hardy as the eponymous reptilian Milverton. Holmes's relationship with the maid is expanded upon, allowing Brett to suggest Holmes' buried tenderness and inability, or unwillingness, to indulge in matters of the heart. Milverton's face is not shown until Watson meets him while viewing artwork at a gallery; prior to this, either Milverton is reading something, he is shown at a distance, or simply viewed from behind. The violence of the villain's end, including the grisly grinding of the avenger's heel into the dead Milverton's bespectacled face, is faithfully adapted, but Holmes and Watson do not at the end gaze upon Milverton's killer's portrait, as the murderess is identified. Deviating from the original story, Holmes holds a very different opinion about the case's end. He requests Watson not to chronicle the case, deeming it to have unpleasant circumstances, whereas in the original story Holmes is slightly more cheerful, as shown by his joking to Lestrade, which is omitted from this adaptation. The Dead Man's Switch episode of the CBS crime drama Elementary loosely adapts the story, with Milverton as a professional blackmailer who contacts his clients and prevents his own exposure by informing them that he has an accomplice who will distribute the damaging material if Milverton is arrested. Milverton is brought to Holmes's attention when he blackmails the family of a rape victim, the family being known to Holmes's addiction sponsor. The case is complicated when Holmes witnesses Milverton's murder while infiltrating his house to retrieve the incriminating footage. Holmes is compelled to locate Milverton's accomplice, who has access to all of Milverton's material and instructions to post it on the Internet if Milverton is caught or killed. The third season of the BBC adaptation Sherlock features 'Charles Augustus Magnussen', portrayed by Lars Mikkelsen, as a primary antagonist. The episode His Last Vow aired 12 January 2014. In it, it is revealed that Charles Magnussen keeps the information with which he blackmails his victims in his own mind palace , only occasionally acquiring hard copies when he has to. Despite Mycroft warning Sherlock to leave Magnussen alone as he is occasionally useful to the government, he is shot dead by Sherlock in order to free John from his power and guarantee Mary's safety, as Sherlock realises by using his mind palace he has no actual evidence in the event of his death. The episode The Adventure of the Portrait of a Teacher in the NHK puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes is loosely based on the story. In it, a portrait of history teacher Charles Augustus Milverton that Beppo draws in class is taken away by himself. Milverton is said to be the severest with pupils in Beeton School and Beppo requests Holmes to take it back. Holmes and Watson steal into the teacher's room where they see a female pupil Agatha, who is tutored by Milverton privately because she is too nervous to attend class with other pupils. She tells them that he is kind and in fact they find Milverton, who goes back to his room for an shocking sight. The episode The Phantom of Whitechapel Act 2 of the Japanese animated series, Yuukoku no Moriarty , introduces Charles Augustus Milverton as an antagonist. In the Phantom of Whitechapel story, a group of individuals murder prostitutes and blame the deeds on Jack the Ripper in hopes of starting a violent revolution to overthrow the government by sowing discord between Scotland Yard and a vigilante group of citizens. At the end of the story, the individuals are murdered by Moriarty, but it is revealed that Charles Augustus Milverton had secretly masterminded the plan. Milverton identifies Moriarty leaving the scene of the murders using a telescope and adds Moriarty's name to a mysterious list.  Radio and audio dramas  A radio adaptation titled Charles Augustus Milverton aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, dramatised by Edith Meiser, aired on 18 May 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode, titled The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton , aired on 4 December 1939.The story was combined with A Study in Scarlet for a radio adaptation titled Dr Watson Meets Mr Sherlock Holmes , which aired on the BBC Light Programme on 5 October 1954 as the first of a series of episodes featuring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on NBC radio on 2 January 1955.Another radio adaptation was made as part of a syndicated series, produced by Harry Alan Towers and starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. Michael Hardwick adapted the story as a 1961 radio drama that aired on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.An audio drama based on the story was released in 1970 on LP record. Holmes was voiced by Robert Hardy and Watson was voiced by Nigel Stock . It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick.An adaptation of the story aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. Charles Augustus Milverton was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Peter Vaughan as Milverton.The story was adapted as a 2008 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Charles Augustus Milverton was played by the creator of Imagination Theatre, Jim French.  Other media  The story, along with The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax , The Adventure of the Empty House , and The Red Headed League , provided the source material for the play The Return of Sherlock Holmes.In Gerald Lientz's 1987 gamebook Death at Appledore Towers Watson's cousin, a prot g of Holmes, investigates Milverton's murder after Holmes has refused to do so. In Donald Thomas's collection of short stories, The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes , Watson admits that Milverton was, in fact, an alias used for the real Charles Augustus Howell. The story also serves as the basis for Thomas's short story in the collection of the same name, The Execution of Sherlock Holmes , in which Milverton's brother Henry kidnap Holmes and stage a kangaroo court, putting Holmes on trial for the murder of Milverton.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in Collier's in the United States on 30 April 1904, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in May 1904.  Plot Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard brings Holmes a mysterious problem about a man who shatters plaster busts of Napoleon. One was shattered in Morse Hudson's shop, and two others, sold by Hudson to a Dr. Barnicot, were smashed after the doctor's house and branch office had been burgled. Nothing else was taken. In the former case, the bust was taken outside before being broken. Holmes knows that Lestrade's theory about a Napoleon hating lunatic must be wrong. The busts in question all came from the same mould, when there are thousands of images of Napoleon all over London. The next day, Lestrade calls Holmes to a house where there has been yet another bust shattering, but there has also been a murder. Mr. Horace Harker found the dead man on his doorstep after investigating a noise. His Napoleon bust was also taken by a burglar entering through a window. It, too, was from the same mould. Also, a photograph of a rather ape ish looking man is found in the dead man's pocket. The fragments of Harker's bust are in the front garden of an empty house up the street. Holmes concludes that the burglar wanted to see what he was doing, for there is a streetlamp here, whereas the bust could have been broken at another empty house nearer Harker's, but it had been dark there. Holmes tells Lestrade to tell Harker, a journalist for the Central Press Syndicate, that he is convinced that the culprit is a lunatic. Holmes knows that this is not true, but it is expedient to use the press to convince the culprit that this is what the investigators believe. Holmes interviews the two shopkeepers who sold the busts and finds out whom they were sold to, and where they were made, Gelder Co. A couple of his informants also recognize the ape ish man in the picture. They know him as Beppo, an Italian immigrant. He even worked in the shop where the first bust was broken, having left his job there only two days earlier. Holmes goes to Gelder Co. and finds out that the busts were part of a batch of six, but other than that, the manager can think of no reason why they should be special, or why anyone would want to destroy them. He recognizes Beppo's picture, and describes him as a rascal. He was imprisoned for a street fight stabbing a year earlier, but has likely been released now. He once worked at Gelder Co., but has not been back. His cousin still works there. Holmes begs the manager not to talk to the cousin about Beppo. That evening, Lestrade brings news that the dead man has been identified as Pietro Venucci, a Mafioso. Lestrade believes that Venucci was sent to kill the culprit, but wound up dead himself. After sending an express message, Holmes invites Dr. Watson and Lestrade to join him outside a house in Chiswick where apparently Holmes is expecting another bust breaking. Lestrade by now is exasperated with Holmes's preoccupation with the busts, but comes. They are not disappointed. Beppo shows up, enters the house, and comes back out of the window minutes later with a Napoleon bust, which he proceeds to shatter. He then examines the pieces, quite unaware that Holmes and Lestrade are sneaking up behind him. They pounce, and Beppo is arrested. He will not talk, however. The mystery is at last laid bare after Holmes offers 10 to the owner of the last existing bust, making him sign a document transferring all rights and ownership of the bust to Holmes. After the seller has left, Holmes smashes the bust with a hunting crop. Among the plaster shards is a gem, the black pearl of the Borgias. Holmes was aware of the case of its disappearance from the beginning. Suspicion had fallen on the owner's maid, whose name was Lucretia Venucci the dead man's sister. Beppo somehow got the pearl from Pietro Venucci, and hid it inside a still soft plaster bust at the factory where he worked, moments before his arrest for the street fight stabbing. After serving his one year sentence, he sought to retrieve the hidden pearl. He found out from his cousin who bought the busts, and through his own efforts and his confederates , even found out who the end buyers were. He then proceeded to seek the busts out, smashing them one by one to find the pearl.  Details Although he appears in later published works, this is one of Lestrade's last appearances within the official canon, near the midpoint of the 60 combined Holmes works by Doyle. After this he is only mentioned by Holmes or Watson in The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax and The Adventure of the Three Garridebs as a working member of the Yard. The story's basic plot device is similar to that used by Doyle in the earlier Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle where a stolen gem was hidden inside the belly of a goose but the criminal is not sure which of the similar geese holds the jewel.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Six Napoleons was published in the US in Collier's on 30 April 1904, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in May 1904. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a short silent film titled The Six Napoleons in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes.The Pearl of Death is a 1944 Sherlock Holmes film that is loosely based on The Six Napoleons .Dressed to Kill also known as Prelude to Murder and Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Code  is a 1946 adaptation loosely based on The Six Napoleons , the busts being replaced with musical boxes. The episode of The Adventures of Superman TV series called Mystery of the Broken Statues is mainly based on The Six Napoleons .The 1965 television series Sherlock Holmes starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson featured an adaptation of The Six Napoleons .This story was dramatized in the popular Granada Television Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett. This version is faithful to the original story although there is a twist. In the original story, Beppo is captured after killing Venucci and his punishment is left unsaid for the audience to guess. In the episode, Beppo had gone to prison for a year after wounding Venucci in a brawl; at the end, Beppo is hanged. Furthermore, Beppo's surname is Cicollini and his role is expanded to have been previously engaged to Lucretia Venucci. Marina Sirtis played Lucretia in this episode. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled The Adventure of the Six Napoleons , aired in 2001.The opening episode of season 4 of the BBC series Sherlock is called The Six Thatchers and is based loosely on this story; at one point Sherlock believes that the suspect is hunting for the black pearl, which he had been asked to look into earlier and dismissed as uninteresting, but it is soon revealed that the suspect is actually hunting for a memory stick containing information about Mary Watson's past.The American TV series on CBS Television, Elementary The Further Adventures also adapts the story. In the cold opening, a break in occurs at 221 B Baker Street. We find Bernardo Beppo Pugliesi retrieving the last of 6 busts, sold from the Royal Wedding 2018. Holmes lets Beppo break the bust, and take the Pearl from the shards. Only to explain the history of Black Pearl, and how Beppo stole the pearl. The day after the original theft, he stabbed a man in a bar fight. Knowing he is being sought in the stabbing, he hid the pearl in his Brothers ceramics factory, before his arrest. His brother made 1,000 busts, that were so ugly, he only sold 6. A year later, Beppo is paroled, and begins the search, leaving a trail of broken statues. In the robbery of the fifth, Beppo strangled the owner. Holmes purchased the last of the six, making quite a show of the purchase, such that Beppo comes to Baker Street. Later at Scotland Yard, Holmes destroys the Pearl. It was made of painted glass. The glass pearl contained a ring with a hollow compartment that Lucrezia Borgia put poison used to kill her families enemies. When she fell out of favor with certain members of the Vatican, she was told to dispose of the ring, her favorite murder weapon. Female DCI Athelney Jones comments to Holmes, My God, Holmes. You did not get the goods on one murder tonight, but two!  Radio  A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Three Students , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes . It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in June 1904, and was also published in Collier's in the United States on 24 September 1904.  Plot  Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves in a university town when a tutor and lecturer of St Luke's College, Mr. Hilton Soames, brings him an interesting problem. Soames had been reviewing the galley proofs of an exam he was going to give when he left his office for an hour. When he returned, he found that his servant, Bannister, had entered the room but accidentally left his key in the lock when he left, and someone had disturbed the exam papers on his desk and left traces that show it had been partially copied. Bannister is devastated and collapses on a chair, but swears that he did not touch the papers. Soames found other clues in his office: pencil shavings, a broken pencil lead, a fresh cut in his desk surface, and a small blob of black clay speckled with sawdust. Soames wants to uncover the cheater and prevent him from taking the exam, since it is for a sizeable scholarship. Three students who will take the exam live above him in the same building. The first, Gilchrist, is athletic, being a hurdler and a long jumper, and industrious ; the second, Daulat Ras, is described as quiet and methodical; the third is Miles McLaren, a gifted man but thoroughly dissolute and given to gambling. Holmes examines the office. The cheater obviously took the papers over to the window one by one while he copied them so that he could see Soames returning, but as it happens, Soames did not come back the usual way. A nearby door leads to Soames's bedroom. Upon examining that, Holmes finds another, similar, sawdust speckled blob of clay. He stuns Soames by telling him that the cheater, upon hearing his approach, hid in Soames's bedroom. He was there, hiding behind a curtain, all the time that Soames was questioning Bannister. The next morning, Holmes and Watson return to Soames's office. Holmes confronts Bannister who he believes is not telling all he knows. Bannister will not own up to anything, and insists that there was no one in Soames's office while he was there. Holmes, however, sends for Gilchrist, and proceeds to lay out his results. The cheater was someone who knew the exam proofs were there. This could only be Gilchrist because the proofs' whereabouts had been kept secret, and Gilchrist was the only one tall enough to look in through Soames's window to see his desk. Holmes has also identified the blobs as the special clay found in the long jump pit, further implicating Gilchrist. Gilchrist reveals his guilt by reproaching Bannister for his apparent treachery. Bannister was indeed the one who covered for Gilchrist. He felt that he had to, for old times' sake: Bannister was once Gilchrist's father's butler. Holmes then explains the remaining clues. The scratch on the desk was caused by Gilchrist's spiked jumping shoes as he grabbed them in his haste, and the clay blobs fell from his shoes. Bannister had collapsed in the chair to hide Gilchrist's gloves, which he saw had been left on the chair. For his part, Gilchrist credits Bannister with convincing him not to profit from his misdeed, and presents Soames with a letter stating his wish not to sit the exam, but to instead accept an offer to work for the Rhodesian Police.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Missing Three Quarter , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes . It was originally published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in August 1904, and was also published in Collier's in the United States on 26 November 1904.  Plot  Mr. Cyril Overton of Trinity College, Cambridge, comes to Sherlock Holmes seeking his help in Godfrey Staunton's disappearance. Staunton is the key man on Overton's rugby union team and they will not win an important match the following day against Oxford if Staunton cannot be found. Holmes has to admit that sport is outside his field, but he shows the same care he has shown to his other cases. Staunton had seemed a bit pale and bothered earlier in the day, but late in the evening, according to a hotel porter, a rough looking, bearded man came to the hotel with a note for Staunton which, judging from his reaction, contained rather devastating news. He then left the hotel with the bearded stranger and the two of them were seen running in the direction of the Strand at about half past ten. No one has seen them since. Overton has wired to Cambridge to find out if Staunton has been seen there; he has not. He has also wired Lord Mount James, Staunton's very wealthy uncle and nearest living relative, but has heard no answer. Staunton is the almost eighty year old Lord Mount James's heir, but he must meanwhile live in relative poverty owing to his uncle's miserly behaviour. Meanwhile, Holmes questions the porter. The bearded man who brought the note was neither a gentleman nor a workman, and he seemed to be bothered by something too, for his hand was trembling as he handed Staunton the note. The only word that the porter overheard of their short conversation was time . At six o'clock, the porter had brought Staunton a telegram, and he saw Staunton write a reply. Staunton told the porter that he would send it himself. Holmes looks at the telegraph forms in Staunton's room, and then at the blotter, finally finding a clue. The impression on the blotter yields a part of the message that Staunton sent: Stand by us for God's sake . Obviously at least one other person is involved , and there is some kind of danger. Other papers left in the room yield clues. Lord Mount James also briefly visits, but can give Holmes no useful information as to his nephew's whereabouts. The old miser seems utterly aghast at the possibility that it might be a kidnapping whose object would be to extort his wealth. Holmes and Watson then go to the telegraph office where Holmes uses a ruse to get the woman there to show him the counterfoil of the message that Staunton sent. It was addressed to Dr. Leslie Armstrong, a medical academic at Cambridge. They go to see him. Armstrong tells Holmes that Staunton is an intimate friend of his. He does not react when told that Staunton has disappeared, and claims not to know where he is, and not to have seen him recently. He also says that Staunton is very healthy, but Holmes then produces one of Staunton's papers, a thirteen guinea bill from Armstrong. Furious, Armstrong refuses to answer any more questions, denies that he had the telegram from Staunton, and has his butler show Holmes and Watson out. They lodge at an inn just across the street from Armstrong's office, where they can watch him. Holmes conducts some inquiries. A man in the yard before the inn tells Holmes that Armstrong, although not in actual medical practice, regularly rides in his brougham out into the country somewhere. The round trip seems to take about three hours. Holmes tries following the brougham on one of its outings, hiring a bicycle for the purpose. He is thwarted by Dr. Armstrong, who makes it quite clear that he is aware that Holmes is following him. He gives Holmes the slip. The next day, Holmes's inquiries in all the local villages come to naught; no one has seen the doctor's brougham passing through their village. The mystery is at last unlocked by Pompey, a beagle foxhound cross by appearance, who tracks the doctor's brougham to a cottage in the countryside after Holmes had coated the wheels in aniseed oil. What Holmes finds is not pleasant. Staunton is there, but is grieving over his young wife, who has just died of consumption. Her existence was kept secret, because Lord Mount James would not have approved of the marriage and would have disowned his nephew. Armstrong had told the woman's father about her condition, and he, the bearded stranger, had unwisely told Staunton, who felt compelled to rush off forthwith.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes . It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in September 1904, and was also published in Collier's in the United States on 31 December 1904.  Plot Sherlock Holmes wakes up Dr. Watson early one winter morning to rush to a murder scene at the Abbey Grange near Chislehurst, Kent. Sir Eustace Brackenstall has been killed, apparently by burglars. Inspector Stanley Hopkins believes that it was the infamous Randall gang who have committed several other burglaries in the neighborhood. At Abbey Grange, Lady Brackenstall tells Holmes that her marriage was not happy; Sir Eustace was a violent, abusive drunkard. She then tells that about 11 o'clock, in the dining room, she encountered an elderly man coming in the French window, followed by two younger men. The older man struck her in the face, knocking her out. When she came to, she was gagged and tied to an oaken chair with the bellrope, which they had torn down. Sir Eustace came into the room and rushed at the intruders, one of whom struck and killed him with a poker. Lady Brackenstall fainted again for a minute or two. She saw the intruders drinking wine from a bottle taken from the sideboard. Then they left, taking some silver plate. Sir Eustace's corpse is still lying at the murder scene. Hopkins tells Holmes some unsavoury things about Sir Eustace: that he poured petroleum over his wife's dog and set it alight, and once threw a decanter at her maid Theresa. Theresa corroborates Lady Brackenstall's account of Sir Eustace being an abusive alcoholic. Examining the bellrope, Holmes notes that if it was tugged hard enough to tear it down, the bell would have rung in the kitchen, and asks why nobody heard it. Hopkins answers that it was late, and the kitchen is at the back of the house, where none of the servants would have heard. This suggests that the burglars must have known this, indicating a link between them and one of the servants. Oddly, the thieves stole only a few items of silver plate from the dining room. The half empty wine bottle and glasses interest Holmes the cork had been drawn with the corkscrew of a multiplex knife , not the long corkscrew in the drawer, and one of the glasses has beeswing dregs in it, but the others have none. Annoyed at being called to investigate a case that apparently has a ready made solution, Holmes decides to catch the train back to London. However, after having mulled things over during the journey, Holmes thinks that Lady Brackenstall's story has too many holes in it and that probably she and Theresa have lied deliberately, staging a false crime scene. Upon returning to the Abbey Grange, Holmes, after examining again the supposed crime scene, reaches this conclusion: the killer cut the bellrope with a knife, and frayed the loose end to make it look broken. Holmes confronts Lady Brackenstall and Theresa, telling them he knows they are lying and demanding the truth, but they stand by their story. On the way out, Holmes notices a hole in the ice on the pond, and writes a note for Hopkins. Holmes searches for the killer: almost certainly a sailor who was previously acquainted with Lady Brackenstall, and whom she and Theresa would protect. Lady Brackenstall traveled by the ocean liner Rock of Gibraltar of the Adelaide Southampton Line, which is now halfway to Australia. However, the ship's first officer, Jack Crocker, who has been promoted to captain, has remained in England and in two days will take command of the company's new ship, Bass Rock. Holmes takes a cab to Scotland Yard but does not go in. He tells Watson he is reluctant to name the criminal to the police until he knows more. That evening, Hopkins calls at 221B Baker Street, with two items of news: As suggested in Holmes' note, the stolen silver was found at the bottom of the pond. Holmes suggests that the theft was a blind a deliberate false clue. However, Hopkins rationalises that the pond was chosen as a temporary hiding place. The Randall gang was arrested in New York that morning, so they couldn't have committed a murder in Kent the previous night. Later that evening, Captain Crocker comes to Baker Street, summoned by a telegram from Holmes. Holmes demands a full account of what happened at the Abbey Grange, warning Crocker that Holmes will summon the police if he lies or conceals anything. Crocker met a woman named Mary on the voyage from Australia. He fell in love with her, but not she with him. Then he happened to meet Theresa, who told him of Sir Eustace's abusive behaviour. He met secretly with Mary at the house; the last time on the previous night. They were in the dining room when Sir Eustace burst in, insulted Mary, and struck her with a cudgel. He then attacked Crocker, who killed him with the poker in self defence. Crocker adds that he has no regret whatever. To avoid the scandal that could ensue, Crocker and Theresa concocted the cover story of burglars caught in the act. He cut down the bellrope exactly as Holmes deduced; he opened the wine bottle with his pocket knife's corkscrew; he took some silver plate and dropped it in the pond. Holmes tells Crocker that the police don't yet know the truth, and that he will wait 24 hours before revealing it, allowing Crocker to get away. Crocker indignantly refuses the offer, insisting that he will only agree to any version of the case that will leave Mary out of it. But Holmes was only testing Crocker, and is impressed by his loyalty to Mary. He has given Hopkins an excellent hint and doesn't feel he must do more. He designates Watson as the jury , and asks him to render a verdict. Watson declares Crocker not guilty. Holmes tells Crocker he will keep silent unless someone else is charged, and that he may come back to Mary in a year.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Second Stain , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 13 stories in the cycle collected as The Return of Sherlock Holmes and the only unrecorded case mentioned passively by Watson to be written. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in December 1904, and was also published in Collier's in the United States on 28 January 1905. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Second Stain eighth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories.  Synopsis  Lord Bellinger, the Prime Minister, and the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, the Secretary of State for European Affairs, come to Holmes in the matter of a document stolen from Hope's dispatch box, which he kept at home in Whitehall Terrace when not at work. If divulged, this document could bring about very dire consequences for all of Europe, even war. They are loath to tell Holmes at first the exact nature of the document's contents, but when Holmes declines to take on their case, they tell him it was a rather injudicious letter from a foreign potentate. It disappeared from the dispatch box one evening when Hope's wife was out at the theatre for four hours. No one in the house knew about the document, not even the Secretary's wife. None of the servants could have guessed what was in the box. Holmes decides to begin with some spies known to him and is then astonished to hear from Dr. Watson that one of those that he names, Eduardo Lucas, has been murdered. Before Holmes has a chance to act, Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope, the European Secretary's wife, arrives unexpectedly at 221B Baker Street. She asks Holmes insistently about the stolen document's contents, but Holmes only reveals there would be regrettable consequences if the document were not found. Lady Hilda also begs Holmes to tell her husband nothing of her visit. Holmes's spy hunt does not go well. Four days after the murder, French police arrest the probable culprit of it, a woman whom Lucas has married in Paris under an alias. She was seen in London near Lucas's house the night of the crime, but she is now useless as a witness because she has gone insane. Inspector Lestrade calls Holmes to the murder scene to examine something odd. Lucas bled over a drugget, and the blood soaked through it, but curiously there is no bloodstain on the floor under the drugget. However, there is one under the opposite edge of the carpet. It can only mean that the constable guarding the crime scene has been foolish enough to let someone in and leave them alone while they moved things in the room, including the carpet. Holmes tells Lestrade to take the constable to a back room and obtain a confession, which he does vigorously. Meanwhile, Holmes pulls the unfastened carpet aside and quickly finds a hiding place in the floor, but it is empty. The errant constable tells Holmes that the unauthorized visitor was a young woman. She apparently fainted at the sight of the blood but had left while the constable went out to fetch some brandy to revive her. As Holmes is leaving Lucas's house, he shows the constable a photograph, and he recognizes it as the visitor. Holmes goes to the Hope household and confronts Lady Hilda, accusing her of the theft. At first, she denies everything but is forced to admit her wrongdoing under the threat of certain scandal. Lady Hilda admits Lucas was blackmailing her with a compromising letter written by her years earlier and demanded the contents of her husband's dispatch box for the return thereof . Lady Hilda went to Lucas's house to do the business when, as it happened, his wife from Paris showed up and confronted him about his affair, believing Lady Hilda was his mistress. Lady Hilda hurriedly left. However, she returned to fetch the stolen document after her visit to Holmes convinced her she needed to do so. She hands the document to Holmes. At Holmes's suggestion, the document is put back in the dispatch box using Lady Hilda's duplicate key. When Hope arrives back home with the Prime Minister, Holmes pretends to believe that the evidence has convinced him that the document must still be in the box. It is soon found, and Hope rejoices that it was only a mistake. In this way, the lost document is restored without Lady Hilda's part in the affair being revealed, though at the possible price of making her husband look a bit stupid. The Prime Minister, however, is no fool. He can see an underlying story, but Holmes responds, We also have our diplomatic secrets.  Background This case was first mentioned in The Adventure of the Naval Treaty . In The Naval Treaty , Watson says that this case has interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. On the other hand, Watson also refers there to Monsieur Dubuque of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side issues who do not appear in the published version of the story. In My Dear Holmes, a biography of Holmes by Gavin Brend, Brend hypothesises that their mention suggests there could be a second adventure featuring a second stain . Some scholars have speculated that the foreign potentate who wrote the missing letter was Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, whose foreign policy was controversial in Britain.A reference in this same story makes it clear that The Adventure of the Second Stain is set in July 1888, in the middle of summer, whereas Watson says in the published version of The Second Stain that the case happened in autumn. Watson states that, due to Holmes's retirement, the detective has been trying to avoid publicity, and only allowed Watson to publish the story because the doctor had promised to in The Adventure of the Naval Treaty. A spy called Oberstein appears both in this story and in The Adventure of the Bruce Partington Plans , set seven years later.

            "text": "The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge is one of the fifty six Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. One of eight stories in the volume His Last Bow, it is a lengthy, two part story consisting of The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles and The Tiger of San Pedro , which on original publication in The Strand bore the collective title of A Reminiscence of Mr. Sherlock Holmes .  Synopsis   The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles  Holmes is visited by a perturbed proper English gentleman, John Scott Eccles, who wishes to discuss something grotesque . No sooner has he arrived at 221B Baker Street than Inspector Gregson also shows up, along with Inspector Baynes of the Surrey Constabulary. They wish a statement from Eccles about the murder near Esher last night. A note in the dead man's pocket indicates that Eccles said that he would be at the victim's house that night. Eccles is shocked to hear of Aloysius Garcia's beating death. Yes, he spent the night at Wisteria Lodge, Garcia's rented house, but when he woke up in the morning, he found that Garcia and his servants had all disappeared. He was alone in an empty house. He last remembers seeing Garcia at about one o'clock in the morning when he came to Eccles's room to ask if he had rung. Eccles met Garcia, a Spaniard, through an acquaintance, and seemed to form an unlikely friendship right away. Garcia invited Eccles to stay at his house for a few days, but when Eccles arrived there, he could tell that something was amiss. Garcia seemed distracted by something, and the whole mood of the visit seemed quite sombre. Indeed, Garcia's mood became even darker once his servant handed him a note that evening. Eccles left Wisteria Lodge and inquired about the place at the estate agent's, and was surprised to find that the rent on the house had been paid in full. Odder still, no one at the Spanish Embassy in London had heard of Garcia. Inspector Baynes produces the note that Eccles saw Garcia receive. It reads Our own colours, green and white. Green open, white shut. Main stair, first corridor, seventh right, green baize. Godspeed. D. , in a woman's handwriting. Could it have been a tryst? Could a jealous husband be behind Garcia's death? It emerges that Baynes has deduced that Garcia's body had been lying out in the open since one o'clock, but Eccles says that this is impossible, as Garcia came to his room about then. Holmes theorizes that Garcia may have tampered with the clocks to get Eccles to bed earlier than he thought it was, and that the whole business of coming to his room and making a point of mentioning that it was one o'clock when it was probably much earlier was likely aimed at setting up an alibi, but for what? All that Holmes can deduce is that the murderer lives near Wisteria Lodge, and in a big house.  The Tiger of San Pedro  Holmes and Dr. Watson go to Esher to see Wisteria Lodge with Inspector Baynes. The constable guarding the house reports a hair raising experience. A brutish looking man the devil himself, thought the constable looked in the window. The constable gave chase, but the intruder got away. Holmes establishes by the footmarks that the constable did not imagine this. Inside the house, a number of odd items are to be seen: something resembling a mummified baby, a bird torn to pieces, a pail of blood, and a platter full of charred bones. Holmes later links these to voodoo, providing an important clue. Suddenly, however, five days after the murder, Holmes is astonished to read in the newspaper that Baynes has arrested someone, Garcia's cook, the brutish fellow who had given the constable such a start. He provides little information, though only grunts. Holmes is sure that the cook is not the murderer, and warns Baynes. Baynes, however, declines Holmes's assistance and advice. Holmes spends the next day reconnoitering the local country houses, and finds one of interest, the Henderson household, whose master has obviously spent time in the tropics, and whose secretary, Lucas, is a dark skinned foreigner. Mr. Henderson's two girls have an English governess named Burnet. Holmes also learns from a sacked gardener that Henderson is rich and scared of something, although no one can say what. Nor can anyone say where he came from. Henderson is also violent. Holmes believes that the cryptic note came from this household, High Gable, and the writer could only be Miss Burnet, who has not been seen since the night of the murder. Holmes decides to go to High Gable, at night, to see whether he can strike at the very heart of the mystery. He does not get the chance. John Warner, the sacked gardener, comes in and announces that the Hendersons have fled by train, and tried to take Miss Burnet with them. He, however, wrestled her into a cab and brought her to the inn where Holmes and Watson are staying. She was obviously unwilling to go with Henderson for she had been drugged with opium. Henderson has also been identified, by Inspector Baynes. He is Don Juan Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro, a hated and feared overthrown dictator from Central America. It turns out that Garcia, who was from San Pedro, not Spain, got himself killed in a revenge plot. Miss Burnet was also part of the plot. Yes, she wrote the note, but Murillo's secretary caught her doing it, Murillo confined her, and then awaited Garcia's move, killing him. Miss Burnet's real name is Mrs. Victor Durando. Her late husband was from San Pedro, its ambassador to Britain and a potential political rival to Murillo. Murillo had him recalled and shot so that he could not pose a threat to Murillo's position. Murillo and his Secretary give the police the slip in London, and resurface in Madrid under new aliases. However, they are both murdered, and their killers are never caught.  Commentary Out of the entire collection of Holmes stories by Doyle, this is the only story in which a police inspector is as competent as Holmes. Holmes has nothing but praise for Inspector Baynes, believing that he will rise high in his profession, for he has instinct and intuition. Inspector Lestrade rarely received this kind of appreciation from Holmes. It comes out that Baynes had only arrested the cook to draw out Henderson so he would think he was no longer under suspicion. San Pedro is a fictitious country; its colours are green and white, explaining one part of the cryptic note.  Publication history  The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge was first published in the US in Collier's on 15 August 1908, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September October 1908. In the Strand, the story was published in two parts: The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles and The Tiger of San Pedro . The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with ten illustrations by Arthur Twidle in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.  Adaptations   Film and television  A short silent film titled The Tiger of San Pedro was based on the story. It was one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, and starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. The Granada TV adaption with Jeremy Brett followed the original story with a few exceptions. There is no mention of any of the voodoo relics in Wisteria Lodge, and it is Watson who gives chase to the cook, not the constable. Also, at the end, The Tiger of San Pedro and his accomplice are not killed in a Madrid hotel, but instead by Garcia's two surviving compatriots with Garcia's brace of pistols on a train while Murillo is fleeing to escape Holmes and the law. In the NHK puppet show Sherlock Holmes, it is Gordon Lestrade, a member of the life guidance committee of Beeton School who has a singular experience. One day he chats with the pupils called Garcia and Henderson but he finds that they go missing the next morning. Baynes, a pupil who informs Holmes about the matter, tells him about their theft of bread from the food storehouse. The discovery of a dog toy in their room leads Holmes to uncover the truth. Kabuki sound effects are used in the episode.  Radio  The story was dramatised by Edith Meiser as a 1931 episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other episodes based on the story aired in January 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson, and in September 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson. Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired in December 1939. Other episodes based on the story aired in 1943 and in 1947 . Wisteria Lodge was adapted for the BBC Light Programme as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The production was adapted by Michael Hardwick and aired on 26 December 1966. Wisteria Lodge was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. In 2008, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Music  The story inspired the 1970s jazz song The Tiger of San Pedro by John LaBarbera, which was made popular by trombone superstar Bill Watrous.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel .

Synopsis Mrs. Warren, a landlady, comes to 221B Baker Street with some questions about her lodger. A youngish, heavily bearded man, who spoke good but accented English, came to her and offered double her usual rent on the condition that he get the room on his own terms. He went out the first night that he was there, and came back after midnight when the rest of the household had gone to bed. Since then, neither Mrs. Warren, her husband, nor their servant girl has seen him. The lodger insisted on having the Daily Gazette every morning, and sometimes requested other things. All requests were printed on a slip of paper left on a chair outside the room where meals were also left. Mrs. Warren has brought some spent matches and a cigarette end from her lodger, hoping that Holmes can read something from them. It is clear that the cigarette has been smoked without a holder, which is quite unusual for a man with whiskers. The lodger also eats very little, and never receives visitors or messages. After the landlady leaves, Holmes remarks to Dr. Watson that it seems likely that the person in Mrs. Warren's house is not the bearded man who made the arrangements. The evidence lies not only in the cigarette, but in the fact that the lodger's knowledge of English is not as good as the bearded man's . Their return on the first night was very late so that no one would see them and they have taken great pains to ensure no one has seen them since. Holmes suspects that messages are being sent to the lodger, perhaps in the Daily Gazette's agony column. He finds them: Will find some sure means of communication. Meanwhile, this column. G. , Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G. , and The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed one A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G. . Holmes needs only wait one day for a very useful message: High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G. Holmes decides that it is time to reconnoitre Mrs. Warren's neighbourhood. Just then, Mrs. Warren arrives complaining that her husband was kidnapped that morning and taken by cab to Hampstead Heath where he was unceremoniously cast onto the roadway. He never got a clear look at his kidnappers or their cab. Holmes realizes that the ruffians mistook Mr. Warren for the lodger, and dumped him after they realized their mistake. Holmes and Watson go to Mrs. Warren's house just before lunchtime, hoping to catch a glimpse of the lodger retrieving the lunch tray. Before going in, Holmes observes that the lodger's window commands a good view down Howe Street, and at the other end is a house matching the one mentioned in the agony column. In Mrs. Warren's house, Holmes and Watson hide in a boxroom. By using a mirror they see the lodger take the lunch tray from the hall chair, discovering that the mysterious person is a comely featured young woman with a dark complexion. They realize that she has been carefully printing her requests to hide her gender. It is equally clear that she and her bearded confederate, likely a lover or husband, are in some kind of danger and seeking refuge. From the lodger's horror at suspecting a trick at lunchtime, and the exceptional precautions that have been taken to ensure secrecy, it must be a matter of life and death. That evening, Holmes and Watson are on hand to see the lodger's confederate's lantern signals, sent by a waving candle. The first message says Attenta, attenta, attenta! . It becomes clear that they are Italian, and from the a ending that the message is meant for a woman. The signaller then flashes Pericolo and then Peri . Realizing that the signaller has been interrupted, Holmes and Watson rush to the house and are surprised to meet Inspector Gregson and a Pinkerton detective from the United States named Leverton . They are lying in wait for Giuseppe Gorgiano, a vicious killer of whose infamy Holmes is well aware. The house has only one door and they know that he is inside. Gregson and Leverton have been unaware of the signalled messages. Gregson says that three men have come out of the house, but none was Gorgiano, who is a giant. One, however, matched the description of the man who made the arrangements at Mrs. Warren's. Going into the house and to the room where the signalling came from, Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Leverton discover a grisly scene. The giant Gorgiano lies on the floor in a pool of blood from having been impaled with a large knife, apparently in a fight. The bearded man is undoubtedly the killer. The lady's arriving at the door shortly afterward is a surprise to everyone but Holmes, who had impersonated the lady's confederate by re lighting the same candle that her confederate had used, and signalling in Italian for her to come. Her name is Emilia Lucca, and her confederate is Gennaro, her husband. The men are rather taken aback by her obvious joy at this ghastly sight. She confirms that the Luccas were seeking refuge from the dangerous Giuseppe Gorgiano, who was out to kill Gennaro for betraying the Red Circle, a secret criminal organization that Gennaro had become involved in as a heatedly resentful young man who was furious at world injustices. Gennaro had never actually participated in any of the society's crimes, however, and had eventually decided to leave the organization in spite of the threatened consequences. He and his wife fled Italy and went to New York to escape the Red Circle, but Gorgiano, another member, discovered Gennaro there, and contrived to oblige him to murder a good friend, a man who had gotten Gennaro started in legitimate business in the U.S. Gennaro had no intention of doing such a thing, and even warned his friend of the Red Circle's orders. The police were also informed. The Luccas then fled to England where Gorgiano tracked Gennaro down, intending to kill him and abduct the lovely Emilia, to whom he had developed a lustful attraction. Gorgiano died in the ensuing fight, however. Gregson feels compelled to take Emilia down to the police station, and the same fate probably awaits Gennaro, but as their actions had been purely in self defense, it seems likely that there will be no charges.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Red Circle was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March April 1911, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in April May 1911. The story was published with three illustrations by H. M. Brock and one by Joseph Simpson in The Strand Magazine, and with the same illustrations in the US edition of the Strand. It was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was adapted as a short silent film in 1922. It was one of the short films in the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, and starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.The 1945 film Pursuit to Algiers sources some of its characters from this story. The 1994 Granada TV series adaptation makes several key modifications to the short story: The episode introduces a new character . Inspector Gregson is replaced by Inspector Hawkins. Gorgiano makes an attempt to infiltrate the Warrens' house and kidnap Emilia. He is chased away by Leverton. Emilia notices Holmes and Watson in the boxroom, realizes she has been seen and quickly locks her door. With coaxing and explanations by Holmes, the frightened woman hesitantly unlocks the door. Holmes enters Emilia's room and speaks with her, hearing the story of how she and her husband ended up involved with the Red Circle. Emilia arrives at the scene of the fight between Gorgiano and Gennaro before Holmes and his party do.  Radio  The Adventure of the Red Circle was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired on 15 October 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another production of the story aired in February 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson.The story was also adapted for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The radio adaptation, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, was titled Mrs. Warren's Lodger and aired on 7 December 1941, the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The East Coast broadcast was interrupted by a radio announcement that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would be addressing the nation at noon the following day. The story was adapted for BBC Radio 2 in 1969 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Red Circle was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Joan Sims as Mrs Warren.In 2013, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Of note This is the last appearance of Inspector Tobias Gregson in Doyle's work. Explanations for this have been a matter of debate for readers. Although Gregson's meeting with Holmes is coincidental, he is swift to grasp the implications of getting his help and claims to have been grateful for his work with the Yard in the past. The Pinkerton detective Leverton is called the hero of the Long Island cave mystery by Holmes. But there is no explanation of what the Long Island cave mystery entailed. This is considered by some to be one of untold cases of the Holmesian canon, though it doesn't seem to have involved Holmes. This mystery seems paradoxical because there are no real caves on Long Island, New York, but there are caves on Long Island, in the Bahamas. Howe Street is a creation of Conan Doyle, overlooking Orme Street, which is commonly known as Great Ormond Street located in Central London, northeast from the British Museum. Watson describes Orme as a narrow thoroughfare and Howe in possession of more pretentious houses.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Dying Detective , in some editions simply titled The Dying Detective , is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was originally published in Collier's in the United States on 22 November 1913, and The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in December 1913. Together with seven other stories, it was collected in His Last Bow .  Plot summary Dr. Watson is called to tend Holmes, who is apparently dying of a rare tropical disease, Tapanuli fever, contracted while he was on a case. Watson is shocked, not having heard about his friend's illness. Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days. Holmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. In fact, he scorns to be treated by Watson and insults his abilities, astonishing and hurting the doctor. Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or call in a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. While Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes's room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches items explaining that he does not like his things touched. At six o'clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives. Watson goes to Smith's address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith's attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith's arrival. Believing that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It emerges, to the hiding Watson's horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith's nephew Victor Savage. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die. Holmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies no longer in the voice of a man near death a match and a cigarette. Inspector Morton then enters the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith points out that his word is as good as Holmes' in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation. Holmes explains his illness was feigned as a ruse to induce Smith to confess to his nephew's murder. Holmes was not infected by the little box; he has enough enemies to know that he must always examine his mail carefully before he opens it. Starving himself for three days and the claim of the disease's infectious nature was to keep Watson from examining him and discovering the ruse, since, as he clarifies, he has every respect for his friend's medical skills.  Period details In the story, the killer Culverton Smith's motive for killing his nephew, Victor Savage, is mentioned in an offhand remark by Holmes that Savage stood between this monster Smith and a reversion. The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes has a note for this word: In this instance, reversion refers to the undisposed of part of an estate, which will presumably fall into possession of the original grantor or his representative. Note that in Shoscombe Old Place, the eponymous residence reverts to the brother of the late Sir James Falder upon the death of Sir James' widow, Lady Beatrice. The setting date may be inferred from Watson's mention of it being the second year of my marriage , the first having been 1889. Inspector Morton is referred to in a familiar fashion but this is his only appearance in canon. Canonical scholar Leslie S. Klinger wondered if Morton was the companion to Inspector Brown in The Sign of the Four.Tropical disease specialist William A. Sodeman Jr., proposed that Tapanuli fever was melioidosis, a conclusion supported by physician Setu K. Vora. Vora raised the possibility that Conan Doyle read the first report of melioidosis published in 1912 before writing his short story in 1913.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Dying Detective was published in the US in Collier's on 22 November 1913, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1913. The story was published with three illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with four illustrations by Walter Paget in the Strand. The story was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.  Adaptations   Film and television  A 1921 short film adaptation was released in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes. A 1951 TV episode of We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in... was adapted from the story, starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Bill Owen as Inspector Lestrade. The episode is now lost. A 1994 TV episode of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, Edward Hardwicke as Watson, and Jonathan Hyde as Culverton Smith was adapted from the story. This version is faithful to the original short story but greatly expanded. It features much more detail on Smith's nephew, who is instead portrayed as Smith's cousin, and replaces the infected spring with a pair of tacks. The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century titled The Adventure of the Deranged Detective . A 2012 TV episode of Elementary starring Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes, which is the ninth episode of the first season, mirrors many elements from the story, albeit with Holmes simply ill from a more conventional disease that thus limits his ability to conduct fieldwork. A 2017 episode of Sherlock includes the character Culverton Smith, portrayed by Toby Jones. The title of the episode, The Lying Detective , is a play on the title of the original story. Unlike the original tale, where Culverton Smith is only suggested to have committed one murder, The Lying Detective presents him as a wealthy philanthropist who has arranged for a particular room in a hospital he sponsors to have a secret passage that he can use to sneak in and kill anyone being treated in it. Alerted to Smith's true nature by his apparently psychotic daughter as part of an unknown agenda, Sherlock uses this as an opportunity to create a dangerous situation that John Watson can save him from to fulfill Mary Watson's last request to save John from his grief after her death, deliberately falling off the wagon and reverting to an old drug habit so that he can be regarded as simply delusional, attacking Culverton and accusing him of being a serial killer so that he will be sent to Smith's hospital for treatment. This gives Sherlock a chance to hear Culverton's confession via a recording device hidden in John's old cane, which he had predicted John would leave with him after he was sent to hospital. Although the original confession is ruled inadmissible as Sherlock basically acquired it through entrapment, Culverton subsequently willingly confesses his crimes to Lestrade, gleefully musing that he will be even more famous now.  Radio  The Dying Detective was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode, which aired in 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other productions of the story aired in 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson, and 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson. An episode titled The Riddle of the Dying Detective aired in 1939 in the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. Another episode titled The Adventure of the Dying Detective aired in 1943. The story was also adapted into a 1947 radio episode of the series, with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson. This version features Inspector Lestrade instead of Inspector Morton. A 1954 radio adaptation with John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired on the BBC Light Programme. Hugh Manning played Inspector Morton. Along with other Sherlock Holmes radio adaptations with Gielgud and Richardson, the production aired on NBC radio in 1955. The story was adapted for BBC radio in 1967 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. A 1994 BBC Radio 4 adaptation dramatised by Robert Forrest aired as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Edward Petherbridge as Culverton Smith and Alex Jennings as Savage. In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

            "text": "The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of the eight stories in the cycle collected as His Last Bow , and one of the few stories in which for much of the plot Watson must act alone and try his best with Holmes left in the background. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom and The American Magazine in the United States in December 1911.  Plot summary Sherlock Holmes sends Dr. Watson to Lausanne to investigate Lady Frances Carfax's disappearance since he himself is too busy in London. Lady Frances is a lone, unwed woman denied a rich inheritance on account of her gender. She does, however, carry valuable jewels with her. It is also her habit to write to her old governess, Miss Dobney, every other week, but for the past five weeks, there has not been a word from her. She has left the H tel National in Lausanne for parts unknown. Her last two bank transactions were cheques, one to pay her hotel bill, and another for 50 to her maid, Miss Marie Devine. In Switzerland, Watson finds out that Lady Frances stayed at the H tel National for several weeks, but then suddenly left in a hurry one day. Only one witness could suggest an explanation, one involving a big, bearded man who kept hounding her. It also emerges that Lady Frances's maid has left her employ, although it is not known why. Watson finds out where Lady Frances went, and inquires at the Englischer Hof in Baden Baden, Germany. She stayed there for a fortnight and met a couple described as Dr. Shlessinger, a convalescent missionary and biblical scholar from South America, and his wife. Lady Frances left with them three weeks ago for London, and nothing has been heard of her since. Watson also finds out that the big bearded man, the savage , came about a week ago looking for her. Watson telegraphs Holmes about his progress, and oddly, Holmes wires back asking for a description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear. Watson believes this to be Holmes's attempt at humour. Holmes is actually in earnest. Watson visits Marie Devine, the former maid, in Montpellier, France, and it turns out that her upcoming wedding was why she left Lady Frances's employ. The 50 was a wedding present. She, too, believes that the bearded man was the reason that her former mistress left Lausanne. He was quite a rough man. During this interview, Marie sees the very man in question in the street. Watson rushes out and demands to know who he is and what he has done with Lady Frances. A fight ensues and Watson is nearly strangled. A French workman breaks the fight up with his cudgel and the bearded man withdraws. It then turns out that the workman is a disguised Holmes, who suggests that Watson accompany him back to London, and wryly observes that there is no blunder which Watson has failed to commit in this investigation. Before leaving, however, Holmes interviews someone. It is the bearded man, the Honourable Philip Green, an old suitor of Lady Frances's. Yes, he is seeking Lady Frances, but he still wants to win her heart. As a younger man, despite being the son of a famous Admiral, he was not rich. Now that he has made his fortune in South Africa, he hopes she will see him differently, but he is still rather churlish and clearly Lady Frances is unwilling. Holmes recommends that he go back to London. Once Holmes and Watson are back at 221B Baker Street, Holmes reads a telegram from Baden Baden about Dr. Shlessinger's left ear jagged or torn . This confirms Holmes's suspicion that Dr. Shlessinger is in fact Holy Henry Peters, a vicious rascal from Australia . His so called wife's real name is Annie Fraser. He beguiles young women by playing to their religious beliefs, as Shlessinger did with Lady Frances. This suggested his true identity to Holmes. Holmes believes that Lady Frances is in London, and quite possibly dead, or if not, confined in some way. The search seems hopeless. The police follow known associates, Holmes places advertisements hoping to learn something, but nothing happens. Then, a pawnshop reports that someone matching Shlessinger's description has pawned a pendant very much like one owned by Lady Frances. He gave a false address, but this gives Holmes what he needs. He has Philip Green wait in the pawnshop, knowing that Henry Peters will want to pawn more jewellery. It takes a few days, but he is not disappointed. His wife shows up this time to pawn a matching pendant, and Green follows her, first to an undertaker's, where he finds Peters's wife discussing an out of the ordinary order, and later to an address in Brixton. He watches the house and sees some men deliver a coffin. Holmes writes Green a note and sends him to the police to fetch a warrant. Meanwhile, Holmes and Watson go first to the undertaker's to ask about the funeral it is at eight o'clock the next morning and then to Brixton where they demand to see Dr. Shlessinger, or whatever he may call himself. Once inside, in the absence of a warrant, Holmes is obliged to resort to force to search Peters's house. He finds the coffin, and deep inside it is a small, emaciated, very old, dead woman. It is certainly not Lady Frances. Peters explains that it is his wife's old nurse. The police come and tell Holmes and Watson that they must leave. Peters gloats over Holmes's obvious humiliation. The day ends in apparent failure. Nothing suspicious can be found about the household, no warrant arrives, and Holmes and Watson go back to Baker Street. Holmes does not sleep that night, preferring to go over the case in his mind. Finally, early the next morning, Holmes realises what is going on. He and Watson rush to Brixton and make sure that the coffin is not removed from the house to go for burial. They unscrew the coffin lid and find Lady Frances inside, chloroformed. The Peterses, while dishonest enough to kidnap someone to steal her jewels, were too squeamish to commit murder directly. Watson manages to revive her, and the Peterses are found to have fled. It was the remark heard by Green at the undertaker's that helped Holmes deduce the truth. The woman there had been talking about an unusual coffin, and Holmes then also remembered that it was a big coffin for a very small woman, the idea being to obtain the necessary legal documents for the old woman, and then legitimise the burial of a coffin containing two bodies.  Publication history  The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1911, and in the US in The American Magazine in the same month. The story was published with five illustrations by Alec Ball in the Strand, and with five illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in The American Magazine. It was included in the short story collection His Last Bow, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.  Adaptations   Film and television  The story was used in the Stoll film series in 1923 featuring Eille Norwood. The story was also adapted in 1965, part of the thirteen episode Sherlock Holmes series starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson, Joss Ackland as Philip Green, Peter Madden as Inspector Lestrade and Ronald Radd as Dr Shlessinger. The Granada TV adaptation starring Jeremy Brett is not completely faithful to the original story. The action takes place entirely in the Lake District of England, where the holidaying Doctor often sees the Lady at the hotel before her disappearance. The story's name and basic theme of disappearance of a lady was used as a basis for the TV series Elementary's episode The Ballad of Lady Frances .  Radio  The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax was dramatised by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 24 September 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A radio adaptation by Meiser also aired on the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14 December 1941 . A dramatisation of the story aired on 26 February 1945 , adapted by Denis Green. Another adaptation aired on 28 March 1948 . The story was adapted for BBC radio in 1960 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. A recording was released in 1971 which starred Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick. It was one of a series of audio dramatisations of several Sherlock Holmes stories originally released as long playing records on the Discourses label. An adaptation aired on BBC radio in 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Jack Klaff as the Hon. Philip Green and Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade. In 2011, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Stage  The story provided some of the source material for the 1923 play The Return of Sherlock Holmes.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot from 1910 is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Arthur Conan Doyle. It is one of eight stories in the cycle collected as His Last Bow. Doyle ranked The Adventure of the Devil's Foot ninth in his list of his twelve favorite Holmes stories.  Plot summary Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson find themselves at Poldhu in Cornwall one spring for the former's health, but the holiday ends with a bizarre event. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, a local gentleman, and Mr. Roundhay, the local vicar, come to Holmes to report that Tregennis's two brothers have gone insane, and his sister has died. Tregennis had gone to visit them in their village , played whist with them, and then left. When he came back in the morning, he found them still sitting in their places at the table, the brothers, George and Owen, laughing and singing, and the sister, Brenda, dead. The housekeeper had discovered them in this state, and fainted. The vicar has not been to see them yet. Tregennis says that he remembers one brother looking through the window, and then he himself turned to see some movement outside. He declares that the horrific event is the work of the devil. Mortimer Tregennis was once estranged from his siblings by the matter of dividing the proceeds from the sale of the family business, but he insists that all was forgiven, although he still lives apart from them. The doctor who was summoned, reckoned that she had been dead for six hours. He also collapsed into a chair for a while after arriving. Holmes goes to the house in question and, apparently carelessly, kicks over a watering pot, soaking everyone's feet. The housekeeper tells Holmes that she heard nothing in the night, and that the family had been particularly happy and prosperous lately. Holmes observes the remains of a fire in the fireplace. Tregennis explains that it was a cold, damp night. Afterwards, Holmes lays the case out to Watson thus: Quite obviously, there is no point in attributing the tragedy to the Devil; therefore, what took place can only be the work of a human. Whatever happened to those people happened right after Tregennis left, for they had not moved and everything was in the same place; Mortimer Tregennis went swiftly back to the vicarage where he lives ; The only suggestion of an explanation the movement comes from Mortimer Tregennis; Given the weather, anyone appearing at the window and doing something horrifying enough to instantly kill someone would have had to come right up to the window thus trampling the flowerbed, which is still intact; What on earth could this person at the window have done to cause such horror?None of this seems to make for an elementary case, but soon, new questions are raised. Dr. Leon Sterndale, the famous hunter and explorer, aborts his sailing from Plymouth after the vicar wires him with the tragic news. He asks Holmes what his suspicions are, and is displeased when Holmes will not voice them. After Sterndale leaves, Holmes follows him discreetly. The morning after Holmes comes back to his room, apparently none the wiser for following Sterndale, the vicar arrives in a panic with the news that Mortimer Tregennis has now died in the same way as his sister. The two men, along with Watson, rush to Mortimer's room, and find it foul and stuffy, even though the window has been opened. A lamp is burning on the table beside the dead man. Holmes rushes about, examining many things. The upstairs window seems especially interesting. He also scrapes some ashes out of the lamp, and puts them in an envelope. Holmes deduces how the victims died or went mad and why people present when the death rooms were first opened fainted or felt unwell in each case. He tests his hypothesis by buying a lamp like the one in Tregennis's room, lighting it, and putting some of the collected ashes on the smoke guard. The smoke from this powder is so potent a poison that Holmes is immediately struck down. Watson is able to resist and drags Holmes out of the room just in time. It is clear to Holmes that Mortimer Tregennis poisoned his siblings, but who killed Mortimer? It is Dr. Sterndale, who left physical evidence at the vicarage clearly implicating himself. Holmes confronts Sterndale, who explains that he loved Brenda for years and killed Mortimer in revenge for the cruel murder. The poison is called Radix pedis diaboli , which Sterndale collected from Africa as a curiosity. The toxic contents of the plant root are vaporized by heat and diffuse into the local atmosphere. He once explained to Mortimer what it was and what it was capable of, and Mortimer later stole some to murder his siblings by throwing it on the fire just before he left. Mortimer thought Sterndale would be at sea before news reached Plymouth, but Sterndale recognized the poison's effects from the vicar's description of the tragedy and deduced right away what had happened. Holmes's sympathies in this matter lie with Sterndale, and he tells him to go back to his work in Africa.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . It was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in October 1921, and was also published in Hearst's International in the United States in November 1921.  Plot  Watson arrives in 221B Baker Street where the page boy Billy shows him a wax effigy of Holmes placed near a curtained window in the sitting room. The effigy produces a shadow on the curtain that, when viewed from outside, is the unmistakable profile of Sherlock Holmes. Using this visual trick, Holmes aims to give a perfect target to a would be murderer with a rifle. Holmes names his murderer as Count Negretto Sylvius, the diamond thief he has been following in disguise. He gives the criminal's address to Watson, then sends the doctor out the back for the police. As the Count arrives, Holmes has Billy invite him inside, then takes him by surprise when he attempts an assault on the effigy. Holmes then offers the Count and his helper, boxer Sam Merton, freedom if they give up the jewel, or jail if not. He invites them to discuss the deal while he plays violin in the next room. When the Count decides to double cross Holmes and takes the stone from his secret pocket to show Sam in window light, the detective springs from the chair in place of his replica and grabs the 100K jewel. His bedroom has a gramophone and secret passage to behind the curtain. After the police take away the villains, Lord Cantlemere sweeps in. Unlike the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, he did not want Holmes. When tricked into insisting on arrest for whoever is found possessing the diamond, he finds the jewel in his pocket where Holmes has placed it and apologizes. Finally, Holmes can eat.  Unusual aspects It is notable for being one of only two Arthur Conan Doyle Holmes stories, aside from a couple of humorous vignettes, to be written in third person. The other is His Last Bow . The Mazarin Stone was written this way because it was adapted from a stage play, The Crown Diamond, in which Watson hardly appeared. Its adaptation from the theatre also explains why the action in this story is confined to one room. The plot twist in which Holmes reveals he had been listening to the two criminals as they spoke freely would also not have been possible using a first person narrative. The Crown Diamond, subtitled An Evening with Sherlock Holmes, was first performed on 2 May 1921 at the Bristol Hippodrome, and was written before the short story, which was first published in October 1921. However, historians do not agree on when the play was written, with some believing it was penned in early 1921 while others believe it was written years earlier. In the original play, the villain was Holmes's enemy Colonel Sebastian Moran of The Adventure of the Empty House infamy, not Count Negretto Sylvius. According to Leslie S. Klinger, the name used to describe the Mazarin stone in the short story implies the stone once belonged to Cardinal Jules Mazarin, who, upon his death in 1661, bequeathed to the French monarch a collection of eighteen diamonds thereafter called the Mazarin Diamonds . The name Mazarin is not mentioned in the original play, though the stone is described as a yellow Crown diamond in both the play and the short story.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October 1921, and in the US in Hearst's International in November 1921. The story was published with three illustrations by Alfred Gilbert in the Strand, and with four illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Hearst's International. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Film and television  A short silent film based on the story was released in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures, with Eille Norwood as Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson.An episode of BBC's For the Children adapted the story for television in 1951. Featuring Andrew Osborn as Holmes and Philip King as Watson, no footage is believed to have survived.This story was heavily rewritten for Granada Television's Sherlock Holmes series. In 1994, it was merged with another story, The Adventure of the Three Garridebs . The most noticeable change is that Holmes does not feature except in the prologue and final scene . It is Mycroft Holmes who takes up the case of the stolen diamond, while Watson is retained to look into the Garrideb mystery. The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone was adapted as The Adventure of the Mazarin Chip for a 2001 episode of the animated television show Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century.  Radio  The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 9 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Meiser aired on 23 May 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as episodes of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 5 January 1941 and 4 January 1948 .Two BBC radio adaptations of the story aired as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. The first aired on 2 December 1954 on the BBC Home Service and was dramatised by Felix Felton, with Ralph Truman as Count Negretto Sylvius. The second aired on 4 September 1962 on the BBC Light Programme, and was dramatised by Michael Hardwick, with Francis de Wolff as Count Sylvius. The Mazarin Stone was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Anthony Bate as Lord Cantlemere and Nigel Anthony as Count Sylvius.In 2006, the story was adapted for radio as part of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

            "text": "The Problem of Thor Bridge is a Sherlock Holmes short story by Arthur Conan Doyle collected in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . It was first published in 1922 in The Strand Magazine and Hearst's International .  Plot summary  Neil Gibson, the Gold King and former senator from some Western state , approaches Sherlock Holmes to investigate the murder of his wife Maria in order to clear his children's governess, Grace Dunbar, of the crime. It soon emerges that Mr. Gibson's marriage had been unhappy and he treated his wife very badly. He had fallen in love with her when he met her in Brazil, but soon realised they had nothing in common. He became attracted to Miss Dunbar; since he could not marry her, he had attempted to please her in other ways, such as trying to help people less fortunate than himself. Maria Gibson was found lying in a pool of blood on Thor Bridge with a bullet through the head and note from the governess, agreeing to a meeting at that location, in her hand. A recently discharged revolver with one shot fired is found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe. Holmes agrees to look at the situation in spite of the damning evidence. From the outset, Holmes observes some rather odd things about the case. How could Miss Dunbar so coolly and rationally have planned and carried out the murder and then carelessly tossed the murder weapon into her wardrobe? What was the strange chip on the underside of the bridge's stone balustrade? Why was Mrs. Gibson clutching the note from Miss Dunbar when she died? If the murder weapon was one of a matched pair of pistols, why couldn't the other one be found in Mr. Gibson's collection? Holmes uses his powers of deduction to solve the crime, and demonstrates, using Watson's revolver, how it was perpetrated: Mrs. Gibson, outraged and jealous of Miss Dunbar's relationship with her husband, resolved to end her own life and frame her rival for the crime. After arranging a meeting with Miss Dunbar, requesting her to leave her response in a note, Mrs. Gibson tied a rock on a piece of string to the end of a revolver, and shot herself, the rock pulling the revolver over the side of the bridge; the revolver found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe was the other pistol of the pair, which had been fired off in the woods earlier, and the chip in the bridge was caused by the pistol hitting the stonework as it was pulled off by the rock. Holmes's reconstruction reproduces the damage to the balustrade of the bridge. He asks the police to drag the lake for the revolvers of Watson and Gibson.  Commentary The story is notable within the Sherlock Holmes canon for the initial reference to a tin dispatchbox, located within the vaults of the Cox and Co. Bank at Charing Cross in London, where Dr. Watson kept the papers concerning some of Holmes' unsolved or unfinished cases. According to Watson: Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world . The unknown fate of Phillimore has been a subject for other stories, including: The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr; The Enigma of the Warwickshire Vortex by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre; The Problem of the Sore Bridge by Philip J. Farmer; one episode of the Italian comic book series Storie di Altrove ; Bert Coules's BBC Radio adaptation The Singular Inheritance of Miss Gloria Wilson from The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; and two books by Marvin Kaye, The Incredible Umbrella and The Amorous Umbrella . Also mentioned is the case of Isadora Persano, who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science and that of the cutter Alicia.  Publication history  The Problem of Thor Bridge was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in two parts in February and March 1922, and in the US in Hearst's International in the same months. The story was published with seven illustrations by A. Gilbert in the Strand, and with six illustrations by G. Patrick Nelson in Hearst's International. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Film and television  The Problem of Thor Bridge was adapted as a short silent film titled The Mystery of Thor Bridge in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.The story was adapted for the Sherlock Holmes 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing, but the episode is now lost.The story was also dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV's series Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett with Daniel Massey as Neil Gibson, Celia Gregory as Maria Gibson, and Catherine Russell as Grace Dunbar.A similar framing method is used in Murder, She Wrote, Season 8, Episode 17 To the Last Will I Grapple with Thee .In the 2005 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode Who Shot Sherlock? , the method of killing was mostly similar, with changes including the chip coming off the gun instead of the stonework . But rather than a suicide staged to frame one of the suspects, it turned out another suspect had staged the death.The professor in Elementary, Season 1, Episode 9 , has the same motive as Mrs Gibson and a similar framing method. The same cause of death deduced by Holmes in this story is used in the opening sequence of the same series, Season 2, Episode 9 , with the same intent of throwing suspicion on to another party.  Radio  The Problem of Thor Bridge was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 16 March 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another radio dramatisation of the story aired on 13 June 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes as an episode that aired on 3 November 1940. Another adaptation of the story aired on 1 October 1945. Both episodes starred Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.A radio adaptation titled Thor Bridge aired in 1962 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was dramatised by Michael Hardwick. Robert Ayres played J. Neil Gibson. The Problem of Thor Bridge was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring William Hootkins as J. Neil Gibson.In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as part of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Creeping Man is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle collected in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . The story was first published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom and Hearst's International in the United States in March 1923.  Synopsis A man named Trevor Bennett, the personal secretary of one Professor Presbury, comes to Holmes with a most unusual problem. He is engaged to the professor's daughter, Edith, and the Professor is himself engaged to a young lady, Alice Morphy, although he himself is already 61 years of age. Their impending marriage has caused no scandal, but the trouble seems to have begun at about the time of the engagement. First, the professor suddenly left home for a fortnight without telling anyone of his destination, with the family later learning that he had been to Prague. Upon returning, Presbury unprecedentedly forbid Mr Bennett from opening certain stamped letters. The professor had also brought a carved wooden box from Prague, and became very angry with Bennett for touching it. The whole household also observes severe changes in the man's personality: he has become furtive and sly, with changes in his moods and habits, some of which quite bizarre, though not impeding his functions. Bennett notes particularly strange incidents: one, in which he saw the professor crawling along the hall on his hands and feet, and his master swore him off; and another, witnessed by Edith Presbury, who saw her father at her bedroom window at two o'clock in the morning. Her bedroom is on the second floor, with no long ladder in the garden. Further, the professor's usually faithful Irish Wolfhound has started attacking him , and has to be chained up outside. Holmes and Watson go to the university city of Camford to see the professor. They pretend that they have an appointment, but the professor sees through the ruse, and becomes furiously angry at the intrusion. Bennett dissuades the professor from violence. Holmes and Watson leave, Holmes confiding to Watson that the visit has taught him that the professor's mind is clear and functional, despite recent behaviour. Bennett tells Holmes that he has found the address of the mysterious letters. The addressee is a man named Dorak, a Central European name, fitting with the professor's secret journey to Prague. Holmes later finds out from Mercer, his general utility man , that Dorak is indeed an elderly Bohemian, who keeps a large general store. Holmes examines Edith's bedroom window, finding that the only way to climb up to it is using the creeper, unusual for a 61 year old man. Holmes forms a theory that every 9 days, Professor Presbury takes some drug which causes the odd behaviour, having become addicted in Prague, and is supplied by Dorak in London. Holmes also comes to realise, by connecting the professor's thick and horny knuckles, his odd behaviour, the dog's attacks, and the use of the creeper, that the professor is behaving like a monkey. Shortly after the realisation, Holmes and Watson are treated to a firsthand display of Professor Presbury's odd behaviour. He comes out of the house, scampers about on all fours, climbs on the creeper, and torments the tied up dog. Unfortunately, the wolfhound gets loose and attacks the professor. The two of them, with Mr Bennett's help, get the dog off the professor, who is wounded badly. Watson and Bennett, also a medical man, tend to the professor's injuries. Holmes then examines the professor's little wooden box after having obtained the key from the unconscious owner. It contained a drug, as Holmes expected, but also a letter from a man named Lowenstein, a quack. The professor had sought out Lowenstein's rejuvenation treatments, for his upcoming marriage to a younger woman. The drug's effects are explained as a consequence of being obtained from langurs. Promising to hold Lowenstein responsible, Holmes muses on the consequences of such drugs, and departs with Watson.  Commentaries David Stuart Davies, who has written an afterword for the Case Book, comments that this story veers towards risible science fiction . Indeed, there is something a bit less scientific in this story than is usually the case with Conan Doyle's writing. This is one of four stories said to be forged drivel in Nicholas Meyer's 1974 novel The Seven Per Cent Solution. Ancient philosophy scholar Jonathan Barnes writes of encountering the story as a child and finding it one of the richest and most singular investigations of Holmes's long career an opinion which I have had no reason to change ... Revisited in adulthood, the story reveals itself as a sour parable about the endurance of lust, a lurid treatment of the question that is put to Falstaff as Doll Tearsheet fidgets on his knee: 'Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance?'. Yet, curiously, the feeling persists that there is something in the narrative hidden, submerged which the reader is not permitted to comprehend but which forms the source of its power.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Creeping Man was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in March 1923, and in the US in Hearst's International in the same month. The story was published with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand, and with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Hearst's International. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 2 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes as an episode which aired on 27 November 1939 . Another dramatisation of the story aired on 9 July 1943. Both episodes featured Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. An adaptation of the story aired on 10 March 1947 with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson. The Creeping Man was also dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Robert Forrest as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robin Ellis as Professor Presbury and Annabel Mullion as Alice Murphy.In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  The story was dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV's Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. The adaptation is relatively faithful to the plot, but includes a subplot involving Inspector Lestrade investigating the theft of various primates from London's zoos: these are later revealed by Holmes to be the sources from which Dorak obtains his serum. A 2001 episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was adapted from the story.  Sources Lowenstein's development of a rejuvenation serum derived from monkeys parallels actual treatments popularised in the early twentieth century, notably those of the Russian born surgeon Serge Voronoff, who had experimented with injections of extracts from animal glands; in the 1920s he popularised the transplantation into humans of tissue from monkey testicles.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire , written by British author Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes stories collected between 1921 and 1927 as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in the January 1924 issues of The Strand Magazine in London and Hearst's International in New York.  Plot summary  Holmes receives an odd letter that makes reference to vampires. Mr. Robert Ferguson, who comes to 221B Baker Street the next morning, has become convinced that his Peruvian second wife has been sucking their baby son's blood. By his first wife, he has a 15 year old son named Jack, who suffered an unfortunate accident as a child and now, although he can still walk, does not have full use of his legs. Since the start of the bloodsucking, Jack has unaccountably been struck twice by his stepmother, although Mr. Ferguson cannot imagine why. Ever since being found out by her husband, she has locked herself in her room and refused to come out. Only her Peruvian maid, Dolores, is allowed in. She takes Mrs. Ferguson her meals. Even before Holmes and Watson set off for Mr. Ferguson's house in Sussex, Holmes has worked out what is going on, and it has nothing to do with vampires. Holmes's trip is made simply to observe and confirm what he has already deduced. Upon their arrival in Sussex, Mrs. Ferguson's maid announces that her mistress is ill, and Dr. Watson offers to help. He finds an agitated woman in the room upstairs she speaks of all being destroyed, and of sacrificing herself rather than breaking her husband's heart. She also demands her child, who has been with the nurse, Mrs. Mason, ever since Mr. Ferguson found out about the bloodsucking incidents. Holmes examines the South American weapons displayed in the house and meets the children. While Mr. Ferguson is doting on his younger son, Watson notices that Holmes is gazing at the window. He cannot imagine why his friend is doing this. Holmes then reveals the truth about what has been happening, much to the relief of Mrs. Ferguson as this is exactly what she has been hoping for: for the truth to come from someone else's lips. It turns out that the culprit is Jack, Mr. Ferguson's elder son, who is extremely jealous of his young half brother. Holmes has confirmed this by looking at Jack's reflection in the window while his father's attention was on the baby. Jack has been attempting to murder his half brother by shooting poisoned darts at him, and his stepmother's behaviour of sucking the baby's neck is thereby explained: she was sucking the poison out. It also explains why she struck Jack, and why she was sick when Holmes and Watson arrived. The wounds, therefore, were caused by the darts, not by her biting.  Matilda Briggs and the Giant Rat of Sumatra In The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire , Holmes mentions to Watson the case of the ship Matilda Briggs and the Giant Rat of Sumatra, identifying it as a story for which the world is not yet prepared . This single reference has been expanded upon by a number of other authors and performers who have either created their own versions of the story or alluded to it in tales of their own.Edith Meiser wrote a script based on the reference for the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The script was used for an episode, titled The Giant Rat of Sumatra , that aired on 9 June 1932. An episode with the same title also aired in the related radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 1 March 1942.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1924, and in the US in Hearst's International in the same month. The story was published with four illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand, and with four illustrations by W. T. Benda in Hearst's International. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 16 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The script was used again for an episode that aired on 7 March 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 2 October 1939 , and another episode that aired on 14 December 1947 .A radio dramatisation of the story adapted by Michael Hardwick aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1964, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Sussex Vampire was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Michael Troughton as Robert Ferguson.In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  In a 1993 televised adaptation of this case entitled The Last Vampyre, produced by Granada Television and starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, the case was altered. In the televised version, Holmes was called by the town vicar to investigate the death of the baby, with the prime suspect being the newly arrived Mr. John Stockton, a man who is rumoured to be descended from a family of vampires. During this investigation, it is revealed that Jack, driven to delusions due to the childhood accident which cost him the full use of his legs, has come to believe himself to be a vampire because of the power and fear such a creature inspires, seeing Stockton as a 'mentor' of sorts due to his seemingly vampire like ability to charm women. The case concludes with Stockton dead in an accident, Ferguson so terrified at these events that he tries to stake Stockton's corpse, and Jack throwing himself from a ruined house trying to fly as part of his delusion. When Holmes and Watson discuss the case as they wait for their train, Watson suggests that he might edit the case before releasing it to the public. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire Lot , first aired in 1999.The 2018 Japanese television drama Miss Sherlock adapted The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire in season 1, episode 4 The Wakasugi Family , setting it in modern day Japan. The episode is fairly faithful to the original, but includes a secondary antagonist motivated by revenge.  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One of the 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes , it was first published in Collier's in the United States on 25 October 1924, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in January 1925. According to Dr. Watson's opening narration, this story is set at the latter end of June, 1902 ... the same month that Holmes refused a knighthood for services which may perhaps some day be described. This is a parallel to the knighthood of Arthur Conan Doyle around the same time.  Plot Holmes receives a letter from a Nathan Garrideb of 136 Little Ryder Street, asking for help in a most peculiar quest. He is looking for another man with his unusual surname, for it will mean a 5 million inheritance for him. He has been approached by another man, John Garrideb of Kansas, who says that he needs to find others with the same last name. The American Garrideb comes to see Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street, and is apparently not very pleased that Nathan Garrideb has involved a detective. Garrideb, who claims to be a lawyer, spins a ridiculous story about Alexander Hamilton Garrideb, a millionaire land tycoon he met in Kansas. Hamilton Garrideb bequeathed his 15 million estate to John Garrideb on the provision that he find two more Garridebs to share it with equally. He came to England to seek out people with the name, having failed in his own country. So far, he has found only Nathan. During the interview, Holmes detects many discrepancies in John Garrideb's story, ranging from the time he has spent in London being obviously longer than he claims and his knowledge of a completely fictitious mayor of the town where Garrideb claims to have lived in before coming to England, but decides not to confront him. This piques Holmes' interest, and he decides to contact Nathan Garrideb to investigate further. Upon arrival at Little Ryder Street, Holmes observes Nathan Garrideb's nameplate outside the house. It has obviously been there for years; so Holmes concludes that Garrideb is at least his true surname. It turns out that Nathan Garrideb is an elderly eccentric who collects everything from ancient coins to old bones. Garrideb's rooms look like a small museum. He is obviously a serious collector, but has nothing of great value in his collection. Holmes finds out that John Garrideb has never asked for any money, nor has he suggested any course of action. Nathan Garrideb has no reason, it seems, to be suspicious of John Garrideb. This puzzles Holmes. During Holmes's and Watson's visit, John Garrideb arrives in a most jolly mood. He has apparently found a third Garrideb, as proof of which he shows a newspaper advertisement purportedly placed by a Howard Garrideb in the course of his everyday business. Holmes sees instantly that John Garrideb has placed the advertisement himself from various Americanisms in the spelling and wording. Despite Nathan Garrideb's objections for he is a man who very seldom goes out, much less travels John Garrideb insists that Nathan go to Birmingham and meet this Howard Garrideb. It has now become clear to Holmes what the rigmarole of lies is all about. John Garrideb wants Nathan Garrideb to be out of his rooms for a while. The next day brings fresh information. Holmes goes to see Inspector Lestrade at Scotland Yard and identifies John Garrideb as James Winter alias Morecroft alias Killer Evans, who escaped prison after shooting three men in the States. In London, he killed Rodger Prescott, a Chicago forger whose description matches the former occupant of Nathan Garrideb's room. Holmes and Watson go to Garrideb's home armed with revolvers. They do not have to wait long before Winter shows up. From their hiding place, Holmes and Watson see the criminal use a jemmy to open a trapdoor revealing a little cellar. They capture Winter, but not before he manages to shoot twice, striking Watson in the leg. For once, Holmes shows his human side; he is distraught over Watson's injury, and strikes Winter on the head with the butt of a gun hard enough to draw blood, vowing that the villain would have never left the rooms alive if he had killed Watson. Fortunately, Watson's wound is superficial. The little cellar contains a printing press and stacks of counterfeit banknotes, hidden there by Prescott, the man that Winter killed. Winter is sent back to prison. Nathan Garrideb ends up in a nursing home, so great is his disappointment, but many CID men are pleased that Prescott's equipment has at last been found. Watson seems the happiest at the adventure's outcome despite being hurt, declaring, It was worth a wound, it was worth many wounds, to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask , from the sight of Holmes's panic and rage over his friend's shooting.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Three Garridebs was published in the US in Collier's on 25 October 1924, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1925. The story was published with three illustrations by John Richard Flanagan in Collier's, and with five illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.As noted by Wilma Morgan, The Three Garridebs takes up many plot elements used in the much earlier story The Red Headed League . Both stories feature a rather naive, sedentary, middle aged bachelor who happens to sit on a location of great interest to cunning criminals. And in both stories, a very elaborate hoax is cooked up, involving a fake bequest by a fictional rich American, in order to make the bachelor go away and leave the criminals a clear field which would have worked fine but for Sherlock Holmes seeing through the hoax. One difference between the two stories and I am not sure that it is an improvement is that in the second case, unlike the first, the innocent bachelor is deeply hurt and damaged by the hoax worked on him.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 2 June 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Other dramatisations of the story aired on the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 25 December 1939 and 9 May 1949 .A radio adaptation of the story, dramatised by Michael Hardwick, aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. The Three Garridebs was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by David Ashton as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Lou Hirsch as John Garrideb.In 2009, the story was adapted for radio as part of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  The then newly formed NBC sought permission from Lady Conan Doyle to produce The Three Garridebs for American television in 1937. This would be the first televised adaptation of Doyle's detective. Louis Hector was cast as Holmes with William Podmore as Watson. In 1994 the story was again adapted for television. Jeremy Brett was taken ill during the production of the Granada Television adaptation of this story and so Holmes's role in the plot was taken by Mycroft Holmes with Charles Gray called in at short notice to reprise his role as Sherlock's older brother. Some note that In addition to being immensely entertaining, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes has the unfortunate bonus of tracing the decline of Jeremy Brett's health, episode by episode. The case is referenced in the Sherlock episode The Final Problem , when the third Holmes sibling, Eurus Holmes, having taken control of her island prison, challenges Sherlock to identify which of the three Garrideb brothers murdered a man named Evans some months ago or she will kill all three. Sherlock is able to identify which brother committed the crime based on photographs and a description of the shooting, eliminating the other two as one lacked the right motor control and the other wore glasses that would have broken when the rifle he used recoiled. However, Eurus kills the two innocent brothers instead, and when Watson expresses shock she executes the guilty one anyway just to see if it feels any different.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Illustrious Client is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and one of the 12 stories collected as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . It was first published in Collier's in the United States in November 1924, and in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in two parts, in February and March 1925.  Plot Sir James Damery comes to see Holmes and Watson about his illustrious client's problem . General de Merville's young daughter Violet has fallen in love with the roguish and sadistic Austrian Baron Adelbert Gruner, who Damery and Holmes are convinced is a shameless philanderer and a murderer. The victim was his last wife, of whose murder he was acquitted owing to a legal technicality and a witness's untimely death. She met her end in the Spl gen Pass. Holmes also finds out that the Baron has expensive tastes and is a collector and a recognised authority on Chinese pottery. Holmes's first step is to see Gruner, who is amused to see Holmes trying to play a hand with no cards in it . The Baron will not be moved and claims that his charm is more potent than even a post hypnotic suggestion in conditioning Violet's mind to reject anything bad that might be said about him. Gruner tells the story of Le Brun, a French agent who was crippled for life after being beaten by thugs after making similar inquiries into the Baron's personal business. Holmes gets some help with his mission in the form of Shinwell Johnson, a former criminal who now acts as an informer for Holmes in London's underworld. Johnson rakes up Miss Kitty Winter, the Baron's last mistress, who was ruined because of it. She is bent on revenge and will do anything to help Holmes. Kitty tells Holmes that the Baron collects women and chronicles his conquests in a book. Holmes realises that this book, written in Gruner's own hand, is the key to curing Violet of her devotion to the scoundrel. Kitty tells Holmes that this book is kept in the Baron's study. First, Holmes goes to see Violet, bringing Kitty with him, but Violet is proof against Holmes's words. Kitty then makes it clear that Violet might end up dead if she is foolish enough to marry Gruner. The meeting ends with Holmes narrowly averting a public scene involving the enraged Kitty. Next, Holmes is attacked by two men, and the newspapers imply that he is near death. Watson goes to 221B Baker Street only to discover that Holmes's injuries have been exaggerated to give the impression that he will be out of action for quite a while. Several days later, Holmes is sufficiently recovered to be out of bed. The Baron is planning a trip to the United States just before the wedding and will be leaving in three days. Holmes knows that Gruner will take his incriminating book with him, never daring to leave it behind in his study. Holmes orders Watson to learn everything that he can about Chinese pottery in the next 24 hours. The next day, Holmes presents Watson with a fake business card styling him as Dr. Hill Barton and an actual piece of Ming pottery, a saucer. He is to go to Baron Gruner's house, pose as a connoisseur of Chinese pottery, and try to sell the saucer. Watson does as Holmes tells him but cannot fool the Baron for very long. Gruner realises who has sent him. As Watson faces his murderous captor, a noise from another room alerts the Baron and he rushes into his study just in time to see Holmes jump out of the window. The Baron rushes to the window, but Kitty Winter, who has been hiding outside, throws oil of vitriol in his face. Watson applies treatment to his injuries. During Holmes' visit he manages to steal the book. The Baron is now hideously disfigured, but Holmes says this will not put Violet off him. They still need the book to cure her. When Violet sees the book of conquests, written in her fianc 's handwriting, she realises what a rogue he is. An announcement in The Morning Post says that the marriage between Baron Adelbert Gruner and Miss Violet de Merville is off. It also says vitriol throwing charges are being pressed against Kitty Winter. Extenuating circumstances reduce her sentence to the lowest possible for such an offence.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Illustrious Client was first published in the US in Collier's in November 1924, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in February March 1925. The story was published in Collier's with four illustrations by John Richard Flanagan, and in the Strand with eight illustrations by Howard K. Elcock. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Radio and audio dramas  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 23 February 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other dramatisations of the story, likely with the same script or a slightly altered script, also aired in the same series on 8 March 1933 and 18 April 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 5 October 1941 . Another episode adapted from the story aired on 9 May 1948 .A radio adaptation aired in 1960 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.An audio drama based on the story, starring Robert Hardy as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Watson, was released on LP record in 1971. It was dramatised and produced by Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick. The Illustrious Client was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Michael Feast as Baron Gruner and Ruth Gemmell as Violet de Merville.In 2010, the story was adapted for radio as part of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  The story was adapted in 1965 for an episode of Sherlock Holmes, starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson, Peter Wyngarde as Baron Gr ner and Rosemary Leach as Kitty Winter.The 1991 Granada TV version with Jeremy Brett is faithful to the original, except that it shows that Miss Winter's revenge attempt on the Baron was because he had disfigured her neck and chest with vitriol, and in the small detail that Gr ner finds Holmes inside the house, and Kitty rushes inside and past Holmes to throw the vitriol at Gr ner played by Anthony Valentine.In Elementary's third season, Kitty Winter and Adelbert Gruner are introduced in a mid season story arc that changes Gruner from a philanderer and a baron to a corporate vice president and serial rapist murderer. Kitty escaped from his captivity before he was able to kill her. She spends the first half of the season training under Holmes as a detective. When Gruner arrives in New York, she exposes his identity. Violet de Merville is a supporting character, the sister of another suspect who has no connection to Gruner. In this version, Kitty flees the United States to an unstated destination so as to escape arrest after she scarred Gruner's face with a caustic chemical. In a later episode, The View From Olympus, Holmes mentions a previous case about a man who killed his wife on the Spl gen Pass and made her murder look like an accident.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Three Gables is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, collected as one of 12 in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in The Strand Magazine in 1926 as a serial.  Plot The story begins with a visit to 221B Baker Street from Steve Dixie, a black man and a cowardly ruffian who warns Sherlock Holmes to keep away from Harrow. Although Dixie has come to intimidate Holmes, Holmes secures Dixie's future cooperation by threatening to tell what he knows about the suspicious Perkins death involving Dixie. Dixie's boss is Barney Stockdale, and he must be connected with the Harrow Weald case, of which Holmes has just learnt from a message from Mary Maberley, a lady who lives at Three Gables, a house at Harrow Weald. Mrs. Maberley is an elderly woman whose son has recently died in Rome. He was an attach there. Some peculiar things have happened at Three Gables. Mrs. Maberley has lived there nearly two years and in all that time has attracted very little attention from her neighbours. Suddenly, however, a man came to her recently and offered to buy her house and all the furniture in it. She was not really willing to do it, especially after her lawyer, Mr. Sutro, told her that the legal agreement drawn up by this prospective buyer would forbid her to remove any possessions from the house when she moved out. As she is telling Holmes this story, he becomes aware that someone is eavesdropping on the conversation. He opens a door and drags in Susan, a wheezing maid. Holmes manages to establish that Susan communicated to Barney Stockdale the fact that her mistress was hiring Sherlock Holmes, and that precipitated Steve Dixie's visit. Holmes also finds out that a rich woman hired Barney Stockdale and his thugs to do her dirty work. Susan is also a member of the gang but will not give up all their secrets. She leaves in a huff. Obviously, this woman wants something that has come into the house quite recently. Holmes, seeing some trunks with Italian placenames on them, realizes that her late son Douglas's belongings must hold the key. He instructs Mrs. Maberley to try to get Mr. Sutro to spend a couple of nights at Three Gables, to keep the house guarded. Holmes finds Dixie outside, keeping the house under surveillance. Dixie is now inclined to help Holmes if he can, to avoid any indiscreet talk about the Perkins lad who met his end so tragically. He swears, however, that he does not know who has hired Barney Stockdale. Holmes and Watson go back to Three Gables to investigate a burglary that has happened there. The burglars chloroformed Mrs. Maberley and stole a manuscript from her son's belongings. She retained part of one sheet of paper from it when, coming round, she lunged after one of the thieves. The police inspector at the scene treats the matter as an ordinary burglary, but Holmes knows better. He examines the bit of manuscript retained by Mrs. Maberley, and it appears to be the end of a lurid novel. Holmes is struck by the peculiar wording; the story abruptly changes from third person narration to first person narration. It is in Douglas's handwriting; so it would seem that he was putting himself in a story that he was writing. Holmes and Watson go to see Isadora Klein, a wealthy woman who is used to getting what she wants. The happenings at Three Gables, and the information Holmes obtained from Langdale Pike, his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal , have all added up to something. It turns out that Douglas Maberley was involved with Isadora Klein at one time. She broke the relationship off, and he almost wrought his revenge by writing a thinly veiled account of their affair, to be published as a novel. Everyone in London would know who the characters truly were, were the novel ever published. Isadora established that no copy had ever been sent to Douglas's publisher but realized that he must have a copy. She hired Barney Stockdale and his confederates to secure the manuscript. She tried legal means at first, and when that did not work, she resorted to crime. She has burnt the manuscript. Holmes forces Isadora Klein to write a cheque for 5000 to furnish Mrs. Maberley with a first class trip round the world in return for his silence about Isadora's nefarious dealings.  Commentaries  The Adventure of the Three Gables has been criticized for its reliance on racist stereotypes in the portrayal of the black boxer, Steve Dixie. This contrasts strikingly with Doyle's earlier sympathetic portrayal of an interracial marriage, in The Adventure of the Yellow Face . D. Martin Dakin wrote that no admirer of Holmes can read these scenes with or discussing Steve Dixie without a blush . Dakin saw Holmes's crude jeers at Dixie as completely out of character for the detective, and this was one reason behind his conclusion that someone other than Doyle had in fact written the story. Others, including Walter Pond, have rejected Dakin's argument and concluded that there is no reason to doubt Doyle's authorship.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Three Gables was first published in the US in Liberty in September 1926, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in October 1926. The story was published with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Liberty, and with four illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 12 November 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 7 April 1935 .Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 18 January 1942, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson.A radio adaptation of the story aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick. The cast included Frank Singuineau as Steve Dixie and Selma Vaz Dias as Isadora Klein. The Three Gables was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Peter Ling as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, featuring Susannah Corbett as Susan Stockdale and Mary Wimbush as Mrs Maberly. In this adaptation, it is stated that Langdale Pike is a pen name derived from the Langdale Pikes, and that his real name is Clarence Gable. In 2007, the story was adapted as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Like in the 1994 BBC adaptation, it is stated in the episode that Langdale Pike is a pseudonym. In this adaptation, he is a disinherited member of a noble family and his real name is implied to be Lord Peter.  Television  Granada Television's Sherlock Holmes series featuring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr Watson presented the story with several differences. Douglas Maberley is depicted as Mary Maberley's grandson instead of her son; he dies in his grandmother's house after a month of suffering from a bout of pneumonia caused by a savage beating he received from Mrs Klein's hired boxers; Langdale Pike defines himself as a benevolent counterpart of Charles Augustus Milverton and points out that he suppresses more than he exposes; and Steve Dixie retains some enmity towards Holmes and brawls with Watson during the break in. In CBS' contemporary Sherlock Holmes adaptation Elementary, the season 2 premiere episode, Step Nine , features a case very briefly involving a character named Langdale Pike, the owner of a 3D printer manufacturing company that Holmes seeks out via a sign requesting something from him, which he holds up in front of a security camera for an extended period of time. The episode The Adventure of the Blue Polar Bear from the NHK puppet series Sherlock Holmes, is based on The Adventure of the Three Gables and The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle . It features Isadora Klein as a female juvenile gang leader.  References   Sources Cawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083. Dickerson, Ian .

            "text": "The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier is one of 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, include in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes; it was first published in the US in Liberty in October 1926, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in November 1926, and is one of 56 short stories in the canon of Sherlock Holmes. This story is one of only two narrated by Holmes rather than Doctor Watson, the other one being The Adventure of the Lion's Mane . Dr. Watson does not appear in either story.  Plot January 1903, at Baker Street, James M. Dodd sees Holmes about a missing friend, Godfrey Emsworth. Dodd and Emsworth served in the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa during the recent Second Boer War. Emsworth was wounded. Dodd has not seen him since the report of his injury, leading Dodd to believe something is amiss. Dodd wrote to Colonel Emsworth, Godfrey's father, and was told Godfrey went off to sea, but Dodd was not satisfied with this answer. Next, Dodd went to the Emsworth family home, Tuxbury Old Park, near Bedford. There were four people there the Colonel and his wife, and an old butler and his wife. The Colonel was less than gracious. He repeated the story about his son's world voyage, implied Dodd was lying about knowing Godfrey, and seemed irritated at Dodd's suggestion he provide information so he could send a letter to Godfrey. Dodd determined to ascertain Godfrey's fate. That evening, in the ground floor bedroom, Dodd talked to the butler, Ralph. After Ralph mentioned Godfrey in the past tense, Dodd suspected his friend was dead. Ralph indicated no, but dead might be better. The mystery was complicated after Dodd observed Godfrey's face in his window, proving he was on the grounds and not at sea as the colonel claimed. Dodd chased him, but quit after hearing a closing door nearby. Dodd contrived to stay another day at Tuxbury Old Park, and went looking about the property. He saw a well dressed man leaving an outbuilding, whose suspicion was aroused because Dodd was aware he was watching him. Dodd was convinced Godfrey must be in this outbuilding. Dodd went back to the outbuilding at night, and observed the well dressed man and another, who he assumed was Godfrey, through the window. Before he could investigate, Colonel Emsworth appeared. Upset about Dodd violating the family's privacy, he insisted Dodd leave immediately. Dodd went straight to Holmes to relate the story. Holmes needs only to ask about the publication the man with Godfrey was reading, and although Dodd cannot be certain, Holmes seems satisfied with the answer. Upon his arrival at Tuxbury Old Park, Holmes observes a tarry smell coming from the leather gloves Ralph removed. The Colonel threatens to summon the police if Dodd and Holmes do not leave, but Holmes points out that would cause the catastrophe the Colonel wants to avoid. Convincing the colonel he knows the secret, Holmes receives permission to visit the outbuilding; he and Dodd hear Godfrey's story right from his lips. The night he was wounded in South Africa, he went to a house and slept in a bed. After he woke, he realized he was surrounded by lepers. A doctor there told him he was in a leper hospital, and would likely contract the disease after sleeping in a leper's bed. The doctor helped heal his wounds; after Godfrey returned to England, the dreaded symptoms appeared. His family's fear of their son getting institutionalized and the stigma attached to leprosy forced them to conceal his presence. The story ends happily. Holmes brings Sir James Saunders, a famous dermatologist from London. Dr. Saunders determines Emsworth has ichthyosis, or pseudo leprosy, a treatable disease.  Related stories Holmes's investigation of the mystery is delayed because he is engaged in clearing up the case which my friend Watson has described as that of the Abbey School, in which the Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved . The Duke of Holdernesse was the principal client in the case of the Priory School.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier was first published in the US in Liberty in October 1926, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in November 1926.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. It is notable for being narrated by Holmes himself, instead of by Dr. Watson .  Plot The story takes place towards the end of July 1907. Holmes is enjoying his retirement in Sussex when one day at the beach, he meets his friend Harold Stackhurst, the headmaster of a nearby preparatory school called The Gables. No sooner have they met than Stackhurst's science teacher, Fitzroy McPherson, staggers up to them, clearly in agony and wearing only an overcoat and trousers. As he collapses, he mutters lion's mane , and then dies. They see welts all over his back, possibly administered by a flexible weapon of some kind, for the marks curve over his shoulder and around his ribs. Moments later, Ian Murdoch, a mathematics teacher at The Gables, comes up behind them. He has not seen the attack and has only just arrived at the beach from the school. Holmes sees a couple of people far up the beach, but thinks they are much too far away to have had anything to do with McPherson's death. Likewise, the few fishing boats off the beach are too far out. It emerges that Murdoch and McPherson were friends, but had not always been. Murdoch is an enigmatic fellow with an occasional bad temper. He once threw McPherson's dog through a plate glass window, for instance. Despite this, Stackhurst is sure that the two were on good terms with each other. McPherson had a lover; Maud Bellamy was McPherson's fianc e. A note confirming a meeting with her was found on McPherson. Holmes looks at the lagoon formed by a recent storm that local men have been using as a bathing pond. He sees McPherson's towel lying there dry and concludes that he never went into the water. Holmes arranges to have the caves and other nooks at the foot of the cliffs searched. Nothing and no one turns up, which is what Holmes expected would be the case. Stackhurst and Holmes visit Miss Bellamy, to see whether she can shed any light on this perplexing mystery. Just as they are approaching The Haven, the Bellamys' house, they see Ian Murdoch emerge. Stackhurst demands to know what he was doing there, and an angry exchange ensues with Murdoch declaring that it is none of Stackhurst's business. Stackhurst loses his temper and sacks Murdoch on the spot. Murdoch then storms off to get ready to move out. They visit the Bellamys and find a beautiful woman in Maud Bellamy, and two extremely unpleasant men in her father and muscular brother. Mr Bellamy and his son do not approve of the liaison between Maud and McPherson; indeed, they learn of the engagement at this meeting, so secret had been the affair. Maud says that she will help however she can. She says that Murdoch admired her. This, in turn, causes Holmes to suspect that he may be responsible for McPherson's death, out of jealousy. Then McPherson's dog is found dead at the pool where McPherson met his end. It obviously died in agony, much as its master had. At this point, Holmes begins to suspect something else. The dead McPherson's dying words, lion's mane , have triggered a memory, but he cannot quite place it. Inspector Bardle of the Sussex Constabulary visits Holmes to ask if there is enough evidence to arrest Murdoch. Holmes is sure that there is not. Murdoch has an alibi. He also could not have single handedly overcome McPherson, who was quite strong, despite having heart trouble. The two men consider McPherson's wounds. The weals looked as though they might have been administered by a hot wire mesh, or perhaps a cat o' nine tails. Holmes is poised to go back to the bathing pond to test a theory he has formed which might explain McPherson's death. As he is about to leave, Murdoch arrives, helped in by Stackhurst, who is afraid that Murdoch might be dying; he fainted twice in pain. He has the same wounds on him that McPherson had. In great agony, he passes out, but finally recovers due to his having a stronger heart than McPherson's had been. At the bathing pond, Holmes spots the murderer: a lion's mane jellyfish , a deadly creature about which Holmes has read. Holmes pushes a boulder off a cliffside and crushes the creature underneath it. Murdoch is exonerated. Given his former relationship with Maud, he had helpfully acted as a go between for her and McPherson to avoid her unfeeling father's learning of the romance, but for the same reason, did not wish to discuss it with anyone. Upon Murdock's learning of McPherson's death, he had gone to tell Maud, and then asked her if he himself could resume his previous romance with her now that McPherson was no longer alive. Maud was too heartbroken over her fiance's sudden demise to want a relationship with anyone for the time being, however, and so she had turned Murdoch down, which explained his sour mood when confronted by Stackhurst a few days earlier. Stackhurst forgives Murdoch and gives him his job back.  Narrator This is one of only two stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to be narrated by Sherlock Holmes himself instead of Dr Watson. The other story is The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier . According to Owen Dudley Edwards, the original manuscript of the story indicates that Doyle initially planned to have Holmes chronicle his own defeat. The solution to the case given by Holmes in the final version was originally provided by a naturalist called Dr Mordhouse. This aspect was ultimately removed and Dr Mordhouse does not appear in the final version.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Lion's Mane was first published in the US in Liberty in November 1926, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1926. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Liberty, and with three illustrations by Howard K. Elcock in the Strand. It was included in the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.A facsimile of the original manuscript was published in 1992 by Westminster Libraries and The Sherlock Holmes Society of London.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser in 1931 as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 23 March 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another dramatisation of the story adapted by Meiser aired on 1 August 1936 .Meiser also adapted the story as episodes of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that aired on 13 November 1939 and 25 January 1942 . In an adaptation of The Adventure of the Lion's Mane that aired on 21 April 1947, Tom Conway played Holmes with Bruce as Watson.A radio adaptation of the story aired in 1969 on BBC Radio 2, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr Watson. It was dramatised by Michael Hardwick. The Lion's Mane was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.In 2009, the story was adapted for radio as part of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  The Lion's Mane was indirectly referenced in the BBC adaptation Sherlock in The Six Thatchers , where Sherlock and John, while solving cases, jokingly comment on the stupidity of arresting a jellyfish. In the CBS adaptation Elementary, in the introduction of The Geek Interpreter, Sherlock briefly reports solving the 1926 cold case death of Fitzroy McPherson, identifying the Lion's Mane jellyfish as the culprit.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Retired Colourman , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes.  Plot Sherlock Holmes is hired by a retired art supply dealer from Lewisham, Josiah Amberley, to look into his wife's disappearance. She has left with a neighbour, Dr. Ray Ernest, taking a sizeable quantity of cash and securities. Amberley wants the two tracked down. Holmes is too busy with another case at the moment, so he sends Dr. Watson to Lewisham to observe what he can, although Watson is keenly aware that this is more Holmes's province. He does his best, observing that Amberley is busy painting his house, which seems a bit odd. He even sees Amberley's wife's unused theatre ticket; she and her young man disappeared while Amberley went to the theatre alone after his wife complained of a headache. Watson notes the seat number. Watson also sees Amberley's strongroom from which his wife had taken the valuables. She, apparently, had a key of her own. He meets a lounger with a rather military appearance in the street, and later observes him running to catch the train at Blackheath Station as he is returning to 221B Baker Street. Holmes recognises the description; it is his rival in detection, Barker. It later turns out that Ray Ernest's family has hired him to find the missing doctor. A number of other things about Amberley are obvious. He is a miser, and as such is quite a jealous man. He is an avid chess player , suggesting to Holmes that he also has a scheming mind. Holmes suspects something, and so sends Watson and Amberley on a fool's errand to the remote village of Little Purlington, near Frinton in Essex, just to keep Amberley out of the way while Holmes breaks into his house to investigate it. He is caught by Barker, but they decide to work together. They reach a conclusion, and later Holmes confronts Amberley with the dramatic question What did you do with the bodies? Holmes manhandles Amberley just in time to stop him taking a poison pill. Amberley is obviously guilty. Holmes explains how he reached his conclusion. Amberley's alibi fell apart when Holmes discovered that his seat at the Haymarket Theatre had not been occupied on the night in question, its number deduced from the ticket that Watson had seen. Also, the painting was a clue. Holmes realised that it was being done to mask a smell, and he soon discovered what that was: gas. He found a gas pipe leading into the strongroom with a tap outside. Amberley had lured his wife and her lover for so he had believed Dr. Ernest to be into the strongroom, locked them in, and turned the gas on, killing them out of jealousy. He had simply hidden the stolen valuables somewhere. In indelible pencil, one of the victims wrote We we , perhaps meaning to write We were murdered. The bodies are found in a disused well in the garden, hidden under a dog kennel, just where Holmes suggested that the police look. Amberley apparently hired Holmes out of pure swank , believing that no one would ever find him out. Holmes believes that Amberley will likely end up at Broadmoor rather than on the scaffold, owing to his mental state.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Retired Colourman was first published in the US in Liberty in December 1926. It was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in January 1927. The story was published with four illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Liberty, and with five illustrations by Frank Wiles in the Strand. It was included in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes, a short story collection published in the UK and the US in June 1927.  Adaptations   Radio  The story was adapted by Edith Meiser in 1931 as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It aired on 6 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Meiser was also a writer for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which aired two episodes based on the story, on 11 March 1940 and 3 September 1943 respectively. Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson.A radio adaptation by Michael Hardwick of The Retired Colourman aired in 1964 on the BBC Light Programme, as part of the 1952 1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. The Retired Colourman was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989 1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Stephen Thorne as Inspector Lestrade, George Cole as Josiah Amberley, and Natasha Pyne as Mrs Amberley. In this version, Holmes is implied to have retired and left Baker Street unceremoniously immediately afterwards, feeling that he has lost a step and that it is time for the country, and for solitude, and for thought, and for my bees. In 2009, the story was adapted for radio by M. J. Elliott as an episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.  Television  The story was adapted as an episode of the 1965 BBC television series Sherlock Holmes starring Douglas Wilmer as Holmes, Nigel Stock as Watson and Maurice Denham as Josiah Amberley. The only difference is that Inspector Mackinnon is replaced by Inspector Lestrade .  References Notes SourcesCawthorne, Nigel . A Brief History of Sherlock Holmes. Running Press. ISBN 978 0762444083.

            "text": "The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger , one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes.  Synopsis Holmes is visited by Mrs Merrilow, a landlady from South Brixton who has an unusual lodger who never shows her face. She saw it once accidentally and it was hideously mutilated. This woman, formerly very quiet, has recently taken to cursing in the night, shouting Murder, murder! and You cruel beast! You monster! Also, her health has taken a turn for the worse, and she is wasting away. Mrs Merrilow has brought this case to Holmes's attention as her tenant, Mrs Ronder, will not involve the clergy or the police in something that she would like to say. She has told her landlady to mention Abbas Parva, knowing that Holmes would understand the reference. Indeed he does. It was a most tragic case in which a circus lion somehow got loose and savaged two people, one of whom was killed, and the other badly disfigured. The latter is apparently this lodger the former was her husband. Holmes could make little of the case at the time, but perhaps if someone had actually hired him, the outcome would have been different. As it was, the inquest ruled that Mr Ronder was the victim of death by misadventure. Still, even the local police were a bit disturbed at the time by some seeming inconsistencies in the accounts. For example, the lion was part of an act which Mr and Mrs Ronder performed right in its cage, and they were the ones who fed it. Why had it suddenly turned on its feeders? Why had it not tried to escape? Who was this man that several people heard screaming when supposedly Mr Ronder had already been killed? Upon arriving at Brixton, Holmes and Watson are shown into Mrs Ronder's room, which she seldom leaves. She is wearing her veil. Her purpose, it seems, is to make a clean breast of the matter before she dies. She tells Holmes and Watson that Mr Ronder was a terrible husband, cruel and violent in the extreme, even to the circus animals, but he didn't care, even though he wound up in the dock for it several times. He was very rich and the fines meant nothing. The circus strongman, Leonardo, was Mrs Ronder's lover. He was always very supportive and encouraging to her, who, in turn, felt that Leonardo was the only man her husband feared. Eventually, Mrs Ronder and Leonardo realized that Mr Ronder was not fit to live, and formed a plan to kill him. As part of the plan, Leonardo made a club with five nails in it, which could deliver wounds that might be mistaken for those of a lion's paw. Then, one night at Abbas Parva, a small village in Berkshire where the circus was camped for the night, Mrs Ronder and Leonardo carried out their plan. When Mrs Ronder and her husband went to the lion's cage to feed it, Leonardo crept up behind them and smashed Mr Ronder's head with the club, and Mrs Ronder released the lion to make it appear that it had broken free and done the deed. But the lion, having been driven into a feeding frenzy by the scent of Mr Ronder's blood, turned and pounced on Mrs Ronder instead, badly chewing her face up in the process. At the sight of this, Leonardo started screaming and ran to get help from the other circus members. He could have saved his lover himself by using the club on the lion, but he was too cowardly. Mrs Ronder could not bring herself to implicate Leonardo in her husband's murder at the inquest, and is only now telling Holmes and Watson this story because she believes that she will soon die. She never saw or heard of Leonardo again, and later learned that he had drowned. Ever since the night of the incident, she has lived alone and veiled. Holmes can only offer advice in this situation; realising that Mrs Ronder is contemplating suicide, he reminds her that her life is worth something as an example of patient suffering in an impatient world. She responds to this by lifting her veil, and the sight is ghastly. Nevertheless, Holmes receives a bottle of prussic acid from Mrs Ronder two days later. She was going to use it to kill herself, but upon considering what Holmes told her, she apparently thought better of it.  Publication history  The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger was first published in the US in Liberty in January 1927, and was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in February 1927.

            "text": "The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place is the next to last of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The story is part of the short story collection The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. It was first published in the US in Liberty in March 1927. It was published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1927. The original title The Adventure of the Black Spaniel was changed before publication.  Plot  Head trainer John Mason from Shoscombe Old Place, a racing stable in Berkshire, comes to Sherlock Holmes about his master, Sir Robert Norberton. Mason thinks he has gone mad. Sir Robert's sister, Lady Beatrice Falder, owns Shoscombe, but it will revert to her late husband's brother when she dies. The stable has a horse, Shoscombe Prince, who Sir Robert hopes will win the Derby. He would be out of debt if that actually happened. Mason is not quite sure what he wants Holmes to investigate, but a number of odd changes have happened at the stable: Why has Lady Beatrice suddenly forgone her usual habit of stopping to greet her favourite horse? Why does she just ride on by in her carriage? Why has Sir Robert become so wild eyed lately? Why has he given his sister's dog away to a neighbourhood innkeeper? Why does he go to the old crypt at night, and who is that man whom he meets there? Why have burnt human bones been found in the furnace at Shoscombe?Holmes decides to investigate on the spot. He and Dr. Watson go to Berkshire posing as anglers and learn some interesting things. The keeper of the inn where they are staying is the one who now has Lady Beatrice's dog, and it is quite an expensive breed, one that an innkeeper ordinarily could never afford. With the innkeeper's permission, Holmes takes the dog for a walk, and goes to Shoscombe, where he releases it as Lady Beatrice's carriage comes out of the gate. The dog dashes forward enthusiastically at first, but then flees in terror. Then, even though a maid and Lady Beatrice are supposedly the only two people in the carriage, it is a male voice that yells Drive on! Then there is the crypt. John Mason observes that a heap of bones there earlier is now gone. Holmes finds a coffin with a fresh, swathed body in it. Just then, Sir Robert arrives, catching Holmes and Watson in the act. After Holmes makes it plain that he has deduced most of the odd goings on, Sir Robert invites him and Watson back to the house and explains everything. About a week earlier, Lady Beatrice died of dropsy, and Sir Robert felt compelled to keep the fact secret so that the creditors would not swoop down on Shoscombe before he had a chance to win the Derby and pay off all his debts. He and the maid's husband hid the body in the crypt, but also found that they had to dispose of an older body in the furnace. This same man also dressed up in Lady Beatrice's clothes and took her place in the carriage each day. The dog knew what had happened and might have given the game away if its noise had aroused suspicion. Holmes refers the matter to the police, but the story ends happily. Shoscombe Prince wins the Derby, Sir Robert escapes any major judicial penalty for what he did to his sister's body, and he pays off all his debts with a great deal left over.  Publication history  The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place was published in the US in Liberty in March 1927, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in April 1927. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Liberty, and with five illustrations by Frank Wiles in the Strand.
