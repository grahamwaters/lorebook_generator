            "text": "A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor. DC motors were the first form of motor widely used, as they could be powered from existing direct current lighting power distribution systems. A DC motor's speed can be controlled over a wide range, using either a variable supply voltage or by changing the strength of current in its field windings. Small DC motors are used in tools, toys, and appliances. The universal motor can operate on direct current but is a lightweight brushed motor used for portable power tools and appliances. Larger DC motors are currently used in propulsion of electric vehicles, elevator and hoists, and in drives for steel rolling mills. The advent of power electronics has made replacement of DC motors with AC motors possible in many applications.  Electromagnetic motors A coil of wire with a current running through it generates an electromagnetic field aligned with the center of the coil. The direction and magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the coil can be changed with the direction and magnitude of the current flowing through it. A simple DC motor has a stationary set of magnets in the stator and an armature with one or more windings of insulated wire wrapped around a soft iron core that concentrates the magnetic field. The windings usually have multiple turns around the core, and in large motors there can be several parallel current paths. The ends of the wire winding are connected to a commutator. The commutator allows each armature coil to be energized in turn and connects the rotating coils with the external power supply through brushes. The total amount of current sent to the coil, the coil's size, and what it is wrapped around decide the strength of the electromagnetic field created. The sequence of turning a particular coil on or off dictates what direction the effective electromagnetic fields are pointed. By turning on and off coils in sequence, a rotating magnetic field can be created. These rotating magnetic fields interact with the magnetic fields of the magnets in the stationary part of the motor to create a torque on the armature which causes it to rotate. In some DC motor designs, the stator fields use electromagnets to create their magnetic fields which allows greater control over the motor. At high power levels, DC motors are almost always cooled using forced air. Different number of stator and armature fields as well as how they are connected provide different inherent speed and torque regulation characteristics. The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by changing the voltage applied to the armature. Variable resistance in the armature circuit or field circuit allows speed control. Modern DC motors are often controlled by power electronics systems which adjust the voltage by chopping the DC current into on and off cycles which have an effective lower voltage. Since the series wound DC motor develops its highest torque at low speed, it is often used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. The DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel electric locomotives, street cars trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. The introduction of DC motors and an electrical grid system to run machinery starting in the 1870s started a new second Industrial Revolution. DC motors can operate directly from rechargeable batteries, providing the motive power for the first electric vehicles and today's hybrid cars and electric cars as well as driving a host of cordless tools. Today DC motors are still found in applications as small as toys and disk drives, or in large sizes to operate steel rolling mills and paper machines. Large DC motors with separately excited fields were generally used with winder drives for mine hoists, for high torque as well as smooth speed control using thyristor drives. These are now replaced with large AC motors with variable frequency drives. If external mechanical power is applied to a DC motor it acts as a DC generator, a dynamo. This feature is used to slow down and recharge batteries on hybrid and electric cars or to return electricity back to the electric grid used on a street car or electric powered train line when they slow down. This process is called regenerative braking on hybrid and electric cars. In diesel electric locomotives they also use their DC motors as generators to slow down but dissipate the energy in resistor stacks. Newer designs are adding large battery packs to recapture some of this energy.  Brushed  The brushed DC electric motor generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary magnets , and rotating electromagnets. Advantages of a brushed DC motor include low initial cost, high reliability, and simple control of motor speed. Disadvantages are high maintenance and low life span for high intensity uses. Maintenance involves regularly replacing the carbon brushes and springs which carry the electric current, as well as cleaning or replacing the commutator. These components are necessary for transferring electrical power from outside the motor to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. Brushes are usually made of graphite or carbon, sometimes with added dispersed copper to improve conductivity. In use, the soft brush material wears to fit the diameter of the commutator, and continues to wear. A brush holder has a spring to maintain pressure on the brush as it shortens. For brushes intended to carry more than an ampere or two, a flying lead will be molded into the brush and connected to the motor terminals. Very small brushes may rely on sliding contact with a metal brush holder to carry current into the brush, or may rely on a contact spring pressing on the end of the brush. The brushes in very small, short lived motors, such as are used in toys, may be made of a folded strip of metal that contacts the commutator.  Brushless  Typical brushless DC motors use one or more permanent magnets in the rotor and electromagnets on the motor housing for the stator. A motor controller converts DC to AC. This design is mechanically simpler than that of brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor. The motor controller can sense the rotor's position via Hall effect sensors or similar devices and can precisely control the timing, phase, etc., of the current in the rotor coils to optimize torque, conserve power, regulate speed, and even apply some braking. Advantages of brushless motors include long life span, little or no maintenance, and high efficiency. Disadvantages include high initial cost, and more complicated motor speed controllers. Some such brushless motors are sometimes referred to as synchronous motors although they have no external power supply to be synchronized with, as would be the case with normal AC synchronous motors.  Uncommutated Other types of DC motors require no commutation. Homopolar motor A homopolar motor has a magnetic field along the axis of rotation and an electric current that at some point is not parallel to the magnetic field. The name homopolar refers to the absence of polarity change. Homopolar motors necessarily have a single turn coil, which limits them to very low voltages. This has restricted the practical application of this type of motor. Ball bearing motor A ball bearing motor is an unusual electric motor that consists of two ball bearing type bearings, with the inner races mounted on a common conductive shaft, and the outer races connected to a high current, low voltage power supply. An alternative construction fits the outer races inside a metal tube, while the inner races are mounted on a shaft with a non conductive section . This method has the advantage that the tube will act as a flywheel. The direction of rotation is determined by the initial spin which is usually required to get it going.  Permanent magnet stators  A permanent magnet motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the dynamo type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines. To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements; most such are neodymium iron boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed singly fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.  Wound stators  There are three types of electrical connections between the stator and rotor possible for DC electric motors: series, shunt parallel and compound and each has unique speed torque characteristics appropriate for different loading torque profiles signatures.  Series connection  A series DC motor connects the armature and field windings in series with a common D.C. power source. The motor speed varies as a non linear function of load torque and armature current; current is common to both the stator and rotor yielding current squared behavior. A series motor has very high starting torque and is commonly used for starting high inertia loads, such as trains, elevators or hoists. This speed torque characteristic is useful in applications such as dragline excavators, where the digging tool moves rapidly when unloaded but slowly when carrying a heavy load. A series motor should never be started at no load. With no mechanical load on the series motor, the current is low, the counter Electro motive force produced by the field winding is weak, and so the armature must turn faster to produce sufficient counter EMF to balance the supply voltage. The motor can be damaged by overspeed. This is called a runaway condition. Series motors called universal motors can be used on alternating current. Since the armature voltage and the field direction reverse at the same time, torque continues to be produced in the same direction. However they run at a lower speed with lower torque on AC supply when compared to DC due to reactance voltage drop in AC which is not present in DC. Since the speed is not related to the line frequency, universal motors can develop higher than synchronous speeds, making them lighter than induction motors of the same rated mechanical output. This is a valuable characteristic for hand held power tools. Universal motors for commercial utility are usually of small capacity, not more than about 1 kW output. However, much larger universal motors were used for electric locomotives, fed by special low frequency traction power networks to avoid problems with commutation under heavy and varying loads.  Shunt connection  A shunt DC motor connects the armature and field windings in parallel or shunt with a common D.C. power source. This type of motor has good speed regulation even as the load varies, but does not have the starting torque of a series DC motor. It is typically used for industrial, adjustable speed applications, such as machine tools, winding unwinding machines and tensioners.  Compound connection  A compound DC motor connects the armature and fields windings in a shunt and a series combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor. This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed. The motor can be connected in two arrangements: cumulatively or differentially. Cumulative compound motors connect the series field to aid the shunt field, which provides higher starting torque but less speed regulation. Differential compound DC motors have good speed regulation and are typically operated at constant speed.

It is the oldest medal in this field of engineering. The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, small gold replica, certificate, and honorarium. The medal may only be awarded to a new leap breakthrough in the technological area of science.  Background The Edison Medal, named after the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison, was created on 11 February 1904 by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. Other recipients of the Edison Medal include George Westinghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, Michael I. Pupin, Robert A. Millikan , and Vannevar Bush. A complete and authoritative list is published by the IEEE online.After the merger of AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers , in 1963, to form the IEEE, it was decided that IRE's Medal of Honor would be presented as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal. Eleven persons with an exceptional career in electrical engineering received both the IEEE Edison Medal and the IEEE Medal of Honor, namely Edwin Howard Armstrong, Ernst Alexanderson, Mihajlo Pupin, Arthur E. Kennelly, Vladimir K. Zworykin, John R. Pierce, Sidney Darlington, James L. Flanagan, Nick Holonyak, Robert H. Dennard, Dave Forney, and Kees Schouhamer Immink.

            "text": "Albert Einstein ; 14 March 1879 18 April 1955 was a German born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass energy equivalence formula E mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed the world's most famous equation . His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in Einstein becoming synonymous with genius .In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis , Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that God does not play dice . Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z rich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, as Jewish, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.  Life and career   Early life and education  Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium , where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current standard to the more efficient alternating current standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field .Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12 year old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem aged 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12 year old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time Einstein had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow. His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12 year old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a mathematical structure . Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14 year old he says he had mastered integral and differential calculus .At the age of 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy , Einstein was introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him. In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z rich . He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul. In January 1896, with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of W rttemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896 he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1 6. At 17, he enrolled in the four year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.Einstein's future wife, a 20 year old Serbian named Mileva Mari , also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein's and Mari 's friendship developed into a romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra curricular physics in which they were both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Mari that he preferred studying alongside her. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal teaching diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Mari might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his landmark 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions.  Marriages and children  Early correspondence between Einstein and Mari was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named Lieserl , born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Mari was staying with her parents. Mari returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Mari married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Z rich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Mari returned to Z rich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before, Einstein's chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa L wenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. Einstein and Mari divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Mari any future Nobel Prize money.In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be. He spoke about a misguided love and a missed life regarding his love for Marie.Einstein married L wenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans M hsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach , Estella Katzenellenbogen , Toni Mendel and Ethel Michanowski , with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov .Einstein's son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally, after her death, being committed permanently to Burgh lzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Z rich.  Patent office  After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner level III.Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology .Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time. With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self mockingly named The Olympia Academy , which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincar , Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.  First scientific papers  In 1900, Einstein's paper Folgerungen aus den Capillarit tserscheinungen was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905 Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, serving as pro forma advisor. His thesis was accepted in July 1905, and Einstein was awarded a PhD on 15 January 1906.Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis , he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.  Academic career  By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Z rich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.When the Manifesto of the Ninety Three was published in October 1914 a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic Manifesto to the Europeans . In the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling him to concentrate exclusively on research. On 3 July 1913, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. Einstein assumed his position with the academy, and Berlin University, after moving into his Dahlem apartment on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was delayed. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society .In 1911, Einstein used his 1907 Equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun's gravity. In 1913, Einstein improved upon those calculations by using Riemannian space time to represent the gravity field. By the fall of 1915, Einstein had successfully completed his general theory of relativity, which he used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. In 1919, that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: Revolution in Science New Theory of the Universe Newtonian Ideas Overthrown .In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect . While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. Einstein's scientific accomplishments while in Berlin, included finishing the general theory of relativity, proving the gyromagnetic effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and Bose Einstein statistics.  1921 1922: Travels abroad  Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Sciences on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College London.He also published an essay, My First Impression of the U.S.A. , in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America . For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self confident, optimistic, and without envy. In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. In his own travel diaries from his 1922 23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.Because of Einstein's travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ram n y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences. From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva , a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists, and intellectuals. Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values. Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.  1925: Visit to South America  In the months of March and April 1925, Einstein visited South America, where he spent about a month in Argentina, a week in Uruguay, and a week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Einstein's visit was initiated by Jorge Duclout and Mauricio Nirenstein with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. The visit by Einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociaci n Hebraica Argentina with a smaller contribution from the Argentine Germanic Cultural Institution.  1930 1931: Travel to the US  In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind . Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was awkward , as Millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism , where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech's students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament , from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy .Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein's biographer, described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity . Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis .  1933: Emigration to the US  In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family's apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.  Refugee status  In April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues , thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.A month later, Einstein's works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, Jewish intellectualism is dead. One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, not yet hanged , offering a 5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, ... I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise. After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment , and more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence .Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance Council, founded in April 1933 by British liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi persecution, Einstein was able to leave Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their technical standards and put the Allies' technology ahead of theirs.Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's Prime Minister, smet n n , to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein's letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over 1,000 saved individuals .Locker Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.  Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study  On 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout. Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five year research fellowship , but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with G del. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.  World War II and the Manhattan Project  In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included migr physicist Le Szil rd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szil rd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon. To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szil rd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szil rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research. The letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II . In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the race to develop the bomb, drawing on its immense material, financial, and scientific resources to initiate the Manhattan Project. For Einstein, war was a disease ... and he called for resistance to war. By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, I made one great mistake in my life when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification the danger that the Germans would make them ... In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.  US citizenship  Einstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. He recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers. As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America's worst disease , seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next . As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, I do not intend to be quiet about it. A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said, Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination .  Personal views   Political views  In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as Why Socialism? His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a 'well regulated system of government' and called their rule a 'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history'. He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind's conscience. Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation states in the framework of a world federation. He wrote I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself. The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as a role model for the generations to come . The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.   Relationship with Zionism  Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the country's development. He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic.Einstein was not a nationalist and was against the creation of an independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help as Israel in 1948. He felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. Nevertheless, upon the death of Israeli president Weizmann in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion offered Einstein the largely ceremonial position of President of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons . Einstein wrote that he was deeply moved , but at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it.  Religious and philosophical views  Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy. He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as na ve. He clarified, however, that I am not an atheist , preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a deeply religious nonbeliever . When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, No. And one life is enough for me. Einstein was primarily affiliated with non religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity. In a German language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them. Einstein had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth, vice president of the German Vegetarian Federation , he wrote:Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind. He became a vegetarian himself only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 he wrote in a letter: So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.   Love of music  Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music. His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically . He said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty. At the age of 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of 'great insight' . What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student. Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Z rich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the K chel catalog of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation .  Death  On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.Einstein refused surgery, saying, I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly. He died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn. Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.  Scientific career Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein synonymous with genius . In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.  1905 Annus Mirabilis papers  The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect , Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are:  Statistical mechanics   Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics  Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title Folgerungen aus den Capillarit tserscheinungen , which translates as Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena . Two papers he published in 1902 1903 attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.  Theory of critical opalescence  Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.  Special relativity  Einstein's Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K rper was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds . The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein's writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Mari , on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time was superfluous.In his paper on mass energy equivalence, Einstein produced E mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics . In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.  General relativity   General relativity and the equivalence principle  General relativity is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It , he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.In 1911, Einstein published another article On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.  Gravitational waves  In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed. The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913 16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.  Hole argument and Entwurf theory  While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only. In June 1913, the Entwurf theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.  Physical cosmology  In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory .In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder . The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation that can account for Hubbel's sic facts, and in which the density is constant over time ... If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space. It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein's steady state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.  Energy momentum pseudotensor  General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason. Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard. The use of non covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schr dinger and others.  Wormholes  In 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein Rosen bridges. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles? . These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.  Einstein Cartan theory  In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.  Equations of motion  The theory of general relativity has a fundamental law the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves. The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations. Since the equations of general relativity are non linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself. This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.  Old quantum theory   Photons and energy quanta  In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles . Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering. Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.  Quantized atomic vibrations  In 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.  Adiabatic principle and action angle variables  Throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements. Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.  Bose Einstein statistics  In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift f r Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra cooling equipment built at the NIST JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.  Wave particle duality  Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In ber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen ber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung , on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.  Zero point energy  In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero point energy in his second quantum theory . Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero point energy.  Stimulated emission  In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser. This article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.  Matter waves  Einstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schr dinger's work of 1926.  Quantum mechanics   Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics  Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God is not playing at dice . Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  Bohr versus Einstein  The Bohr Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.  Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox  In 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in a collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox. In a thought experiment, they considered two particles, which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.Given Einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: either the other particle had these properties already determined, or the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility .Einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated. Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the most influential papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.  Unified field theory  Following his research on general relativity, Einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation . Although he was lauded for this work, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. Notably, Einstein's unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death. Although mainstream physics long ignored Einstein's approaches to unification, Einstein's work has motivated modern quests for a theory of everything, in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum mechanical setting.  Other investigations  Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.  Collaboration with other scientists  In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one shot collaborations with various scientists.  Einstein de Haas experiment  Einstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.  Schr dinger gas model  Einstein suggested to Erwin Schr dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr dinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schr dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co author, although Einstein declined the invitation.  Einstein refrigerator  In 1926, Einstein and his former student Le Szil rd co invented the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Le Szil rd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.  Non scientific legacy  While traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death . Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.Einstein's right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.Mount Einstein in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.  In popular culture  Einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities, beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919. Despite the general public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their The Talk of the Town feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory . He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers, Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein. Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine's Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was a cartoonist's dream come true .Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.  Awards and honors  Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect . None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.

            "text": "Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta was an Italian physicist, chemist and lay Catholic who was a pioneer of electricity and power who is credited as the inventor of the electric battery and the discoverer of methane. He invented the voltaic pile in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in 1800 in a two part letter to the president of the Royal Society. With this invention Volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings. Volta's invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments, which eventually led to the development of the field of electrochemistry.Volta also drew admiration from Napoleon Bonaparte for his invention, and was invited to the Institute of France to demonstrate his invention to the members of the institute. Volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him. Volta held the chair of experimental physics at the University of Pavia for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students.Despite his professional success, Volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years. At this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823. The SI unit of electric potential is named in his honour as the volt.  Early life and works Volta was born in Como, a town in northern Italy, on 18 February 1745. In 1794, Volta married an aristocratic lady also from Como, Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons: Zanino, Flaminio, and Luigi. His father, Filippo Volta, was of noble lineage. His mother, Donna Maddalena, came from the family of the Inzaghis.In 1774, he became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the electrophorus, a device that produced static electricity. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter Johan Wilcke. In 1777, he travelled through Switzerland. There he befriended H. B. de Saussure. In the years between 1776 and 1778, Volta studied the chemistry of gases. He researched and discovered methane after reading a paper by Benjamin Franklin of the United States on flammable air . In November 1776, he found methane in the marshes of Angera on Lake Maggiore, and by 1778 he managed to isolate methane. He devised experiments such as the ignition of methane by an electric spark in a closed vessel. Volta also studied what we now call electrical capacitance, developing separate means to study both electrical potential difference and charge , and discovering that for a given object, they are proportional. This is called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt.In 1779, he became a professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia, a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years. Volta's lectures were so crowded with students that the subsequent emperor Joseph II ordered the construction of a new physical theater , today the Aula Volta . Furthermore, the emperor granted Volta substantial funding to equip the physics cabinet with instruments, purchased by Volta in England and France. At the University History Museum of the University of Pavia there are 150 of them, used by Alessandro Volta.  Volta and Galvani  Luigi Galvani, an Italian physicist, discovered something he named, animal electricity when two different metals were connected in series with a frog's leg and to one another. Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity and as a detector of electricity. He also understood that the frog's legs were irrelevant to the electric current, which was caused by the two differing metals. He replaced the frog's leg with brine soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies. In this way he discovered the electrochemical series, and the law that the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, consisting of a pair of metal electrodes separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials . This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series. In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the voltaic pile, an early electric battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and copper. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with brine into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.  Early battery  In announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of William Nicholson, Tiberius Cavallo, and Abraham Bennet.The battery made by Volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells. It consists of two electrodes: one made of zinc, the other of copper. The electrolyte is either sulfuric acid mixed with water or a form of saltwater brine. The electrolyte exists in the form 2 H and SO2 4. Zinc metal, which is higher in the electrochemical series than both copper and hydrogen, is oxidized to zinc cations and creates electrons that move to the copper electrode. The positively charged hydrogen ions capture electrons from the copper electrode, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H2. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode. Thus, there are two terminals, and an electric current will flow if they are connected. The chemical reactions in this voltaic cell are as follows: Zinc: Zn Zn2 2e Sulfuric acid: 2H 2e H2Copper metal does not react, but rather it functions as a catalyst for the hydrogen gas formation and an electrode for the electric current. The sulfate anion does not undergo any chemical reaction either, but migrates to the zinc anode to compensate for the charge of the zinc cations formed there. However, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released. Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.  Last years and retirement  In 1809, Volta became associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In honour of his work, Volta was made a count by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1810.Volta retired in 1819 to his estate in Camnago, a frazione of Como, Italy, now named Camnago Volta in his honour. He died there on 5 March 1827, just after his 82nd birthday. Volta's remains were buried in Camnago Volta.  Legacy  Volta's legacy is celebrated by the Tempio Voltiano memorial located in the public gardens by the lake. There is also a museum that has been built in his honour, which exhibits some of the equipment that Volta used to conduct experiments. Nearby stands the Villa Olmo, which houses the Voltian Foundation, an organization promoting scientific activities. Volta carried out his experimental studies and produced his first inventions near Como. In the Old Campus of the University of Pavia there is the classroom commissioned by Emperor Joseph II to Leopoldo Pollack in 1787 for the lectures of Alessandro Volta, while in the University History Museum there are many scientific instruments that belonged to Volta and his chair and his blackboard.His image was depicted on the Italian Lire 10,000 note along with a sketch of his voltaic pile.In late 2017, Nvidia announced a new workstation focused GPU microarchitecture called Volta. The electric eel species Electrophorus voltai, described in 2019 and the strongest bioelectricity producer in nature, was named after Volta.  Religious beliefs Volta was raised as a Catholic and for all of his life continued to maintain his belief. Because he was not ordained a clergyman as his family expected, he was sometimes accused of being irreligious and some people have speculated about his possible unbelief, stressing that he did not join the Church , or that he virtually ignored the church's call . Nevertheless, he cast out doubts in a declaration of faith in which he said: I do not understand how anyone can doubt the sincerity and constancy of my attachment to the religion which I profess, the Roman, Catholic and Apostolic religion in which I was born and brought up, and of which I have always made confession, externally and internally. I have, indeed, and only too often, failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian, and I have been guilty of many sins: but through the special mercy of God I have never, as far as I know, wavered in my faith... In this faith I recognise a pure gift of God, a supernatural grace; but I have not neglected those human means which confirm belief, and overthrow the doubts which at times arise. I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion, the works of apologists and assailants, the reasons for and against, and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability, even for the merely natural reason, that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion, every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it. May this confession which has been asked from me and which I willingly give, written and subscribed by my own hand, with authority to show it to whomsoever you will, for I am not ashamed of the Gospel, may it produce some good fruit!

            "text": "Alexander Graham Bell was a Scottish born inventor, scientist and engineer who is credited with patenting the first practical telephone. He also co founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1885.Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf; profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society and its magazine while serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903. Beyond his work in engineering, Bell had a deep interest in the emerging science of heredity.  Early life Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847. The family home was at South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell and Edward Charles Bell , both of whom would die of tuberculosis. His father was Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and his mother was Eliza Grace Bell . Born as just Alexander Bell , at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers. For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name Graham , chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend. To close relatives and friends he remained Aleck . Bell and his siblings attended a Presbyterian Church in their youth.  First invention  As a child, young Bell displayed a curiosity about his world; he gathered botanical specimens and ran experiments at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbour whose family operated a flour mill. At the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation at the mill and used steadily for a number of years. In return, Ben's father John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to invent .From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist. Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he revelled in mimicry and voice tricks akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits. Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness , and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour. He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity. Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study acoustics. His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in Dublin, and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his The Standard Elocutionist , which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. The Standard Elocutionist appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf mutes to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write Visible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound. Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including Latin, Scottish Gaelic, and even Sanskrit, accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.  Education  As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, he was enrolled at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at the age of 15, having completed only the first four forms. His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his father. Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell, on Harrington Square. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself. At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a pupil teacher of elocution and music, in Weston House Academy at Elgin, Moray, Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and 10 per session. The following year, he attended the University of Edinburgh, joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to University College London.  First experiments with sound  His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique automaton developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary mechanical man simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a big prize if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could speak , albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the lips and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable Mama ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, Trouve. After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude sounding Ow ah oo ga ma ma . With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate How are you, grandmama? Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a talking dog . These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance. At age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist Alexander Ellis, a colleague of his father. Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of Hermann von Helmholtz's work, The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music.Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork contraption , Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition, Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech. He also later remarked: I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!  Family tragedy  In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London, Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend. Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward Ted, was similarly affected by tuberculosis. While Bell recovered and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London, Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying. Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in South Kensington, London. His first two pupils were deaf mute girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also experienced a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland. Bell's parents embarked upon a long planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property, conclude all of his brother's affairs , and join his father and mother in setting out for the New World . Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.  Canada  In 1870, 23 year old Bell travelled with his parents and his brother's widow, Caroline Margaret Ottaway, to Paris, Ontario, to stay with Thomas Henderson, a Baptist minister and family friend. The Bell family soon purchased a farm of 10.5 acres at Tutelo Heights , near Brantford, Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, large farmhouse, stable, pigsty, hen house, and a carriage house, which bordered the Grand River.At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his dreaming place , a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river. Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved. He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at Onondaga, he learned the Mohawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a Mohawk headdress and danced traditional dances.After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound. He also modified a melodeon so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance. Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.  Work with the deaf  Bell's father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favour of his son. Travelling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors. He was subsequently asked to repeat the programme at the American Asylum for Deaf mutes in Hartford, Connecticut, and the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his harmonic telegraph . The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.Unsure of his future, he contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher. His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened his School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students. While he was working as a private tutor, one of his pupils was Helen Keller, who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that inhuman silence which separates and estranges . In 1893, Keller performed the sod breaking ceremony for the construction of Bell's new Volta Bureau, dedicated to the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf .Throughout his lifetime, Bell sought to integrate the deaf and hard of hearing with the hearing world. Bell encouraged speech therapy and lip reading over sign language. He outlined this in a 1898 paper detailing his belief that with resources and effort, the deaf could be taught to read lips and speak thus enabling their integration within the wider society. Bell has been criticised by members of the Deaf community for supporting ideas that could cause the closure of dozens of deaf schools, and what some consider eugenicist ideas. Bell did not support a ban on deaf people marrying each other, an idea articulated by the National Association of the Deaf . Although, in his memoir Memoir upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race, Bell observed that if deaf people tended to marry other deaf people, this could result in the emergence of a deaf race . Ultimately, in 1880, the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf passed a resolution preferring the teaching of oral communication rather than signing in schools.  Continuing experimentation In 1872, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the Boston University School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was swept up by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping night owl hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover. Worse still, his health deteriorated as he had severe headaches. Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a far reaching decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound. Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six year old Georgie Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15 year old Mabel Hubbard. Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to experiment . Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in. Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior but became the object of his affection. Having lost her hearing after a near fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday, she had learned to read lips but her father, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.  The telephone  By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston laboratory and at his family home in Canada a big success. While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a phonautograph , a pen like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President William Orton, had become the nervous system of commerce . Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent attorney, Anthony Pollok.In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the scientist Joseph Henry, who was then director of the Smithsonian Institution, and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had the germ of a great invention . When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, Get it! That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that. With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant, and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the gallows sound powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice like sounds, but not clear speech.  The race to the patent office  In 1875, Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, George Brown, attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain . Meanwhile, Elisha Gray was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26. Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the U.S. Patent Office. Bell's patent covered the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the electrical resistance in the circuit. When Bell spoke the sentence Mr. Watson Come here I want to see you into the liquid transmitter, Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray, Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment, to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible articulate speech could be electrically transmitted. After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in his previous application in which he described a cup of mercury, not water. He had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.The patent examiner, Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, Marcellus Bailey, with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him 100 . Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.  Later developments  On March 10, 1876, Bell used the instrument in Boston to call Thomas Watson who was in another room but out of earshot. He said, Mr. Watson, come here I want to see you and Watson soon appeared at his side.Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario, Bell sent a tentative telegram to the village of Mount Pleasant four miles distant, indicating that he was ready. He made a telephone call via telegraph wires and faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family with a call between the Bell Homestead and the office of the Dominion Telegraph Company in Brantford along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. The third test on August 10, 1876, was made via the telegraph line between Brantford and Paris, Ontario, eight miles distant. This test was said by many sources to be the world's first long distance call . The final test certainly proved that the telephone could work over long distances, at least as a one way call. The first two way conversation over a line occurred between Cambridge and Boston on October 9, 1876. During that conversation, Bell was on Kilby Street in Boston and Watson was at the offices of the Walworth Manufacturing Company. Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for 100,000, equal to 2,544,688 today. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for 25 million , he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public. A short time later, his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention. Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. One of the judges at the Exhibition, Sir William Thomson , a renowned Scottish scientist, described the telephone as the greatest by far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph .On January 14, 1878, at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, Bell demonstrated the device to Queen Victoria, placing calls to Cowes, Southampton and London. These were the first publicly witnessed long distance telephone calls in the UK. The queen considered the process to be quite extraordinary although the sound was rather faint . She later asked to buy the equipment that was used, but Bell offered to make a set of telephones specifically for her.The Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was the first person to buy stock in Bell's company, the Bell Telephone Company. One of the first telephones in a private residence was installed in his palace in Petr polis, his summer retreat forty miles from Rio de Janeiro.In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental telephone call. Calling from the AT T head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by Thomas Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The New York Times reported: On October 9, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson talked by telephone to each other over a two mile wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston. It was the first wire conversation ever held. Yesterday afternoon on January 25, 1915 , the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400 mile wire between New York and San Francisco. Dr. Bell, the veteran inventor of the telephone, was in New York, and Mr. Watson, his former associate, was on the other side of the continent.  Competitors  As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments. The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear. In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.On January 13, 1887, the U.S. Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided. By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a precedent. With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest arising from the original trial, the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897, leaving several issues undecided on the merits.During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor Antonio Meucci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hope of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's testimony in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions, as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901. Meucci's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon Meucci's death. However, due to the efforts of Congressman Vito Fossella, the U.S. House of Representatives on June 11, 2002, stated that Meucci's work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged . This did not put an end to the still contentious issue. Some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell's work on the telephone was influenced by Meucci's inventions.The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens Halske set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent. The Siemens company produced near identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties. The establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels, Belgium in 1880, as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation. The strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court, necessitated by the legal battles, eventually resulted in his resignation from the company.  Family life  On July 11, 1877, a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married Mabel Hubbard at the Hubbard estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company. Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year long honeymoon in Europe. During that excursion, Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a working holiday . The courtship had begun years earlier; however, Bell waited until he was more financially secure before marrying. Although the telephone appeared to be an instant success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897. One unusual request exacted by his fianc e was that he use Alec rather than the family's earlier familiar name of Aleck . From 1876, he would sign his name Alec Bell . They had four children: Elsie May Bell who married Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor of National Geographic fame. Marian Hubbard Bell who was referred to as Daisy . Married David Fairchild. Two sons who died in infancy .The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's father in law bought a house in Washington, D.C.; in 1882 he bought a home in the same city for Bell's family, so they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.Bell was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882 when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as: I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries. Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a native son by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck. Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. By 1889, a large house, christened The Lodge was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory, were begun that the Bells would name Beinn Bhreagh after Bell's ancestral Scottish highlands. Bell also built the Bell Boatyard on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family. He was an enthusiastic boater, and Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the H.W. Embree and Sons boatyard in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. In his final, and some of his most productive years, Bell split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and Beinn Bhreagh, where they spent increasing amounts of time.Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but Beinn Bhreagh would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened. Both Mabel and Bell became immersed in the Baddeck community and were accepted by the villagers as their own . The Bells were still in residence at Beinn Bhreagh when the Halifax Explosion occurred on December 6, 1917. Mabel and Bell mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax.  Later inventions  Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, Charlotte Gray, Bell's work ranged unfettered across the scientific landscape and he often went to bed voraciously reading the Encyclop dia Britannica, scouring it for new areas of interest. The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the photophone, one for the phonograph, five for aerial vehicles, four for hydroairplanes , and two for selenium cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding alternative fuels.Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder, the hard disc and floppy disc drive, and other magnetic media.Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. Methane gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses.  Photophone  Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a photophone, which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light. Both men later became full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association. On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the Franklin School in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some 700 feet away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.Bell believed the photophone's principles were his life's greatest achievement , telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was the greatest invention I have ever made, greater than the telephone . The photophone was a precursor to the fiber optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s. Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.  Metal detector  Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector through the use of an induction balance, after the shooting of U.S. President James A. Garfield in 1881. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find Guiteau's bullet, partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. Garfield's surgeons, led by self appointed chief physician Doctor Willard Bliss, were skeptical of the device, and ignored Bell's requests to move the President to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.Bell's own detailed account, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning ... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the area that produced a response from the detector having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect. In a footnote, Bell adds, The death of President Garfield and the subsequent post mortem examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.  Hydrofoils  The March 1906 Scientific American article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article, he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant Frederick W. Casey Baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft. During his world tour of 1910 11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the Dhonnas Beag , the first self propelled Bell Baldwin hydrofoil. The experimental boats were essentially proof of concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD 4, powered by Renault engines. A top speed of 54 miles per hour was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability, and steering, along with the ability to take waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia, to work on the pontoons of the HD 4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Pinaud's experience in boatbuilding enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD 4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD 4. Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD 4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour , a record which stood for ten years.  Aeronautics  In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor powered heavier than air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek young help as Bell was at the age of 60. In 1898, Bell experimented with tetrahedral box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetrahedral kites covered in maroon silk. The tetrahedral wings were named Cygnet I, II, and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned in the period from 1907 to 1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site.Bell was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the Aerial Experiment Association , officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife Mabel and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate. The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American Glenn H. Curtiss, a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title world's fastest man , having ridden his self constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the Scientific American Trophy for the first official one kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere, and who later became a world renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge, an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future; Frederick W. Baldwin, the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Hammondsport, New York; and J. A. D. McCurdy Baldwin and McCurdy being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto.The AEA's work progressed to heavier than air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the Red Wing, framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air cooled engine. On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America. The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder . One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a 15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier than air flight in a crash of the Wright Flyer at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908. Their final aircraft design, the Silver Dart, embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the Silver Dart flown by J. A. D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or made the first aircraft flight in Canada. Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the Silver Dart would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy, who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army.  Heredity and genetics Bell, along with many members of the scientific community at the time, took an interest in the popular science of heredity which grew out of the publication of Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species in 1859. On his estate in Nova Scotia, Bell conducted meticulously recorded breeding experiments with rams and ewes. Over the course of more than 30 years, Bell sought to produce a breed of sheep with multiple nipples that would bear twins. He specifically wanted to see if selective breeding could produce sheep with four functional nipples with enough milk for twin lambs. This interest in animal breeding caught the attention of scientists focused on the study of heredity and genetics in humans.In November 1883, Bell presented a paper at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences titled Upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race . The paper is a compilation of data on the hereditary aspects of deafness. Bell's research indicated that a hereditary tendency toward deafness, as indicated by the possession of deaf relatives, was an important element in determining the production of deaf offspring. He noted that the proportion of deaf children born to deaf parents was many times greater than the proportion of deaf children born to the general population. In the paper, Bell delved into social commentary and discussed hypothetical public policies to bring an end to deafness. He also criticized educational practices that segregated deaf children rather than integrated them fulling into mainstream classrooms. The paper did not propose sterilization of deaf people or prohibition on intermarriage, noting that We cannot dictate to men and women whom they should marry and natural selection no longer influences mankind to any great extent. A review of Bell's Memoir upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race appearing in an 1885 issue of the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb states that Dr. Bell does not advocate legislative interference with the marriages of the deaf for several reasons one of which is that the results of such marriages have not yet been sufficiently investigated. The article goes on to say that the editorial remarks based thereon did injustice to the author. The paper's author concludes by saying A wiser way to prevent the extension of hereditary deafness, it seems to us, would be to continue the investigations which Dr. Bell has so admirable begun until the laws of the transmission of the tendency to deafness are fully understood, and then by explaining those laws to the pupils of our schools to lead them to choose their partners in marriage in such a way that deaf mute offspring will not be the result. Historians have noted that Bell explicitly opposed laws regulating marriage, and never mentioned sterilization in any of his writings. Even after Bell agreed to engage with scientists conducting eugenic research, he consistently refused to support public policy that limited the rights or privileges of the deaf.Bell's interest and research on heredity attracted the interest of Charles Davenport, a Harvard professor and head of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 1906, Davenport, who was also the founder of the American Breeder's Association, approached Bell about joining a new committee on eugenics chaired by David Starr Jordan. In 1910, Davenport opened the Eugenics Records office at Cold Spring Harbor. To give the organization scientific credibility, Davenport set up a Board of Scientific Directors naming Bell as chairman. Other members of the board included Luther Burbank, Roswell H. Johnson, Vernon L. Kellogg, and William E. Castle.In 1921, a Second International Congress of Eugenics was held in New York at the Museum of Natural History and chaired by Davenport. Although Bell did not present any research or speak as part of the proceedings, he was named as honorary president as a means to attract other scientists to attend the event. A summary of the event notes that Bell was a pioneering investigator in the field of human heredity .  Death Bell died of complications arising from diabetes on August 2, 1922, at his private estate in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, at age 75. Bell had also been affected by pernicious anemia. His last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2:00 a.m. While tending to him after his long illness, Mabel, his wife, whispered, Don't leave me. By way of reply, Bell signed no... , lost consciousness, and died shortly after.On learning of Bell's death, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, cabled Mrs. Bell, saying: My colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world's loss in the death of your distinguished husband. It will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention, with which his name is immortally associated, is a part of its history. On the behalf of the citizens of Canada, may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy. Bell's coffin was constructed of Beinn Bhreagh pine by his laboratory staff, lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetrahedral kite experiments. To help celebrate his life, his wife asked guests not to wear black while attending his service, during which soloist Jean MacDonald sang a verse of Robert Louis Stevenson's Requiem : Upon the conclusion of Bell's funeral, for one minute at 6:25 p.m. Eastern Time, every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance .Alexander Graham Bell was buried atop Beinn Bhreagh mountain, on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life, overlooking Bras d'Or Lake. He was survived by his wife Mabel, his two daughters, Elsie May and Marian, and nine of his grandchildren.  Legacy and honors  Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities to the point that the requests almost became burdensome. During his life, he also received dozens of major awards, medals, and other tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, including the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in Alexander Graham Bell Gardens in Brantford, Ontario, in 1917. A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers, and other documents reside in both the United States Library of Congress Manuscript Division , and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, Cape Breton University, Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing. A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies in the United States and Canada. Among the major sites are: The Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site, maintained by Parks Canada, which incorporates the Alexander Graham Bell Museum, in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, close to the Bell estate Beinn Bhreagh The Bell Homestead National Historic Site, includes the Bell family home, Melville House , and farm overlooking Brantford, Ontario and the Grand River. It was their first home in North America; Canada's first telephone company building, the Henderson Home of the late 1870s, a predecessor of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada . In 1969, the building was carefully moved to the historic Bell Homestead National Historic Site in Brantford, Ontario, and was refurbished to become a telephone museum. The Bell Homestead, the Henderson Home telephone museum, and the National Historic Site's reception centre are all maintained by the Bell Homestead Society; The Alexander Graham Bell Memorial Park, which features a broad neoclassical monument built in 1917 by public subscription. The monument depicts mankind's ability to span the globe through telecommunications; The Alexander Graham Bell Museum , part of the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site which was completed in 1978 in Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Many of the museum's artifacts were donated by Bell's daughters;In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 French francs for the invention of the telephone from the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, fils. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon III in 1852, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell becoming the second recipient of the grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' , also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his proudest achievement , the photophone , the optical telephone which presaged fibre optical telecommunications while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing , a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness. In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s. In 1898, Bell was elected as the second president of the National Geographic Society, serving until 1903, and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations, including photography, in the magazine. He also served for many years as a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution . The French government conferred on him the decoration of the L gion d'honneur ; the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902; the University of W rzburg, Bavaria, granted him a PhD, and he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912. He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884 and served as its president from 1891 to 1892. Bell was later awarded the AIEE's Edison Medal in 1914 For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone .The bel and the smaller decibel are units of measurement of sound pressure level invented by Bell Labs and named after him. Since 1976, the IEEE's Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications. In 1936, the US Patent Office declared Bell first on its list of the country's greatest inventors, leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its 'Famous Americans Series'. The First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston, Massachusetts, the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf. The Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time. The stamp became, and remains to this day, the most valuable one of the series.The 150th anniversary of Bell's birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative 1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland. The illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell's face in profile, his signature, and objects from Bell's life and career: users of the telephone over the ages; an audio wave signal; a diagram of a telephone receiver; geometric shapes from engineering structures; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet; the geese which helped him to understand flight; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics. Additionally, the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C 100 gold coin, in tribute also to the 150th anniversary of his birth, and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada. That first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell's tutelage, named the Silver Dart. Bell's image, and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money, coinage, and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years. Alexander Graham Bell was ranked 57th among the 100 Greatest Britons in an official BBC nationwide poll, and among the Top Ten Greatest Canadians , and the 100 Greatest Americans . In 2006, Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'. Bell's name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes, corporate namesakes, street and place names around the world.  Honorary degrees  Alexander Graham Bell, who could not complete the university program of his youth, received at least a dozen honorary degrees from academic institutions, including eight honorary LL.D.s , two Ph.D.s, a D.Sc., and an M.D.: Gallaudet College in Washington, D.C. in 1880 University of W rzburg in W rzburg, Bavaria in 1882 Heidelberg University in Heidelberg, Germany in 1886 Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1896 Illinois College, in Jacksonville, Illinois in 1896, possibly 1881 Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1901 St. Andrew's University in St Andrews, Scotland in 1902 University of Oxford in Oxford, England in 1906 University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1906 George Washington University in Washington, D.C. in 1913 Queen's University at Kingston in Kingston, Ontario, Canada in 1908 Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire in 1913, possibly 1914  Portrayal in film and television The 1939 film The Story of Alexander Graham Bell was based on his life and works.

            "text": "Alexander Stepanovich Popov was a Russian physicist, who was one of the first persons to invent a radio receiving device.Popov's work as a teacher at a Russian naval school led him to explore high frequency electrical phenomena. On 7 May 1895, he presented a paper on a wireless lightning detector he had built that worked via using a coherer to detect radio noise from lightning strikes. This day is celebrated in the Russian Federation as Radio Day. In a 24 March 1896 demonstration, he transmitted radio signals 250 meters between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg. His work was based on that of another physicist Oliver Lodge, and contemporaneous with the work of Guglielmo Marconi.  Early life Born in the town of Krasnoturinsk, Sverdlovsk Oblast in the Urals as the son of a priest, he became interested in natural sciences when he was a child. His father wanted Alexander to join the priesthood and sent him to the Seminary School at Yekaterinburg. There he developed an interest in science and mathematics and instead of going on to Theology School in 1877 he enrolled at St. Petersburg university where he studied physics. After graduation with honors in 1882, he stayed on as a laboratory assistant at the university. However the salary at the university was inadequate to support his family, and in 1883 he took a post as teacher and head of laboratory at the Russian Navy's Torpedo School in Kronstadt on Kotlin Island.  Radio wave receiver  Along with his teaching duties at the naval school Popov pursued related areas of research. Trying to solve a problem with the failure in the electrical wire insulation on steel ships led him to further explore oscillations of high frequency electrical currents. His interest in this area of study was intensified by his trip in 1893 to the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition in the United States where he was able to confer with other researchers in the field.Popov also read an 1894 article about British physicist Oliver Lodge's experiments related to the discovery of radio waves by German physicist Heinrich Hertz 6 years earlier. On 1 June 1894, after the death of Hertz, British physicist Oliver Lodge gave a memorial lecture on Hertz experiments. He set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of Hertzian waves and demonstrated their transmission at distances up to 50 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer, a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When received waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the coherer became conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it, with the impulse being picked up by a mirror galvanometer. After receiving a signal, the metal filings in the coherer had to be reset by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table nearby that rang every time a transmission was received. Popov set to work to design a more sensitive radio wave receiver that could be used as a lightning detector, to warn of thunderstorms by detecting the electromagnetic pulses of lightning strikes using a coherer receiver.  Operating principle  In Popov's lightning detector the coherer was connected to an antenna , and to a separate circuit with a relay and battery which operated an electric bell . The radio noise generated by a lightning strike turned on the coherer, the current from the battery was applied to the relay, closing its contacts, which applied current to the electromagnet of the bell, pulling the arm over to ring the bell. Popov added an innovative automatic reset feature of a self tapping coherer where the bell arm would spring back and tap the coherer, restoring it to its receptive state. The two chokes in the coherer's leads prevented the radio signal across the coherer from short circuiting by passing through the DC circuit. He connected his receiver to a wire antenna suspended high in the air and to a ground . The antenna idea may have been based on a lightning rod and was an early use of a monopole wire aerial.  Demonstrations  On 7 May 1895, Popov presented the paper On the Relation of Metallic Powders to Electric Oscillations , which described his lightning detector, to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society in St. Petersburg. Most Eastern sources regard Popov's lightning detector as the first radio receiver, and 7 May has been celebrated since 1945 in the Russian Federation as Radio Day . However, there is no evidence Popov sent any type of message on that occasion. The first account of communication by Popov was a demonstration on 24 March 1896 at the Physical and Chemical Society, when some accounts say the Morse code message     was received from a transmitter 250 meters away and transcribed on the blackboard by the Society president. Historian Charles Susskind in 1962 concluded that Popov did not use radio waves for actual wireless communication before mid 1896.In 1895 Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began work on a purpose built wireless telegraphy system based on Hertzian waves, developing a spark gap transmitter and a much improved automatically reset coherer receiver. By mid 1895 Marconi had transmitted messages 1 2 mile . He then came up with the idea grounding his transmitter as well as his receiver, and by mid 1896 he was transmitting radio messages a mile and a half . Popov and Marconi's early work seems to have been done without knowledge of each other's system, although reading Marconi's June 1896 patent disclosures led Popov to develop a long range wireless telegraphy system. His paper on his experiments: On the relation of metallic powders to electrical oscillations , was published 15 December 1895. He did not apply for a patent for his invention. In July 1895 he installed his receiver and a siphon recorder on the roof of the Institute of Forestry building in St. Petersburg. and was able to detect thunderstorms at a range of 50 km, however he was also aware of its communication potential. His paper, read at the 7 May 1895 meeting, concluded: I can express my hope that my apparatus will be applied for signaling at great distances by electric vibrations of high frequency, as soon as there will be invented a more powerful generator of such vibrations. In 1896, the article depicting Popov's invention was reprinted in the 'Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society'. In March 1896, he effected transmission of radio waves between different campus buildings in St. Petersburg. In November 1897, the French entrepreneur Eugene Ducretet made a transmitter and receiver based on wireless telegraphy in his own laboratory. According to Ducretet, he built his devices using Popov's lightning detector as a model. By 1898, Ducretet was manufacturing equipment of wireless telegraphy based on Popov's instructions. At the same time Popov effected ship to shore communication over a distance of 6 miles in 1898 and 30 miles in 1899.  Later work In 1900 a radio station was established under Popov's instructions on Hogland island to provide two way communication by wireless telegraphy between the Russian naval base and the crew of the battleship General Admiral Apraksin. The battleship had run aground on Hogland island in the Gulf of Finland in November 1899. The crew of the Apraksin were not in immediate danger, but the water in the Gulf began to freeze. Due to bad weather and bureaucratic red tape, the crew of Apraksin did not arrive until January 1900 to establish a wireless station on Hogland Island. By 5 February, however, messages were being received reliably. The wireless messages were relayed to Hogland Island by a station some 25 miles away at Kymi on the Finnish coast. Kotka was selected as the location for the wireless relay station because it was the point closest to Hogland Island served by telegraph wires connected to Russian naval headquarters.By the time the Apraksin was freed from the rocks by the icebreaker Yermak at the end of April, 440 official telegraph messages had been handled by the Hogland Island wireless station. Besides the rescue of the Apraksin's crew, more than 50 Finnish fishermen, who were stranded on a piece of drift ice in the Gulf of Finland, were saved by the icebreaker Yermak following distress telegrams sent by wireless telegraphy. In 1901 Alexander Popov was appointed as professor at the Electrotechnical Institute. In 1905 he was elected director of the institute.  Death In 1905 he became seriously ill and died of a brain hemorrhage on 13 January 1906.  Honors   Radio Day  In 1945 on the 50th anniversary of Popov's experiment the old Soviet Union made 7 May a new holiday, Radio Day, the day they claim Popov invented radio. Historians note this holiday may be more due to Cold War era politics than historical evidence. Radio Day is still officially marked in Russia and Bulgaria.  Named after  A minor planet, 3074 Popov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1979, is named after him. At ITU Telecom World 2011, Igor Shchyogolev, Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation alongside Hamadoun Tour , Secretary General of the ITU, inaugurated the Alexander Stepanovich Popov conference room at ITU's headquarters in Geneva.

            "text": "Alfred Lewis Vail was an American machinist and inventor. Along with Samuel Morse, Vail was central in developing and commercializing American telegraphy between 1837 and 1844.Vail and Morse were the first two telegraph operators on Morse's first experimental line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and Vail took charge of building and managing several early telegraph lines between 1845 and 1848. He was also responsible for several technical innovations of Morse's system, particularly the sending key and improved recording registers and relay magnets. Vail left the telegraph industry in 1848 because he believed that the managers of Morse's lines did not fully value his contributions. His last assignment, superintendent of the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company, paid him only 900 a year, leading Vail to write to Morse, I have made up my mind to leave the Telegraph to take care of itself, since it cannot take care of me. I shall, in a few months, leave Washington for New Jersey, ... and bid adieu to the subject of the Telegraph for some more profitable business.  Early life Vail's parents were Bethiah Youngs and Stephen Vail . Vail was born in Morristown, New Jersey, where his father was an entrepreneur and industrialist who built the Speedwell Ironworks into one of the most innovative iron works of its time. Their other son George Vail, Alfred's brother, was a noted politician. Alfred attended public schools before taking a job as a machinist at the iron works. He enrolled in New York University to study theology in 1832, where he was an active and successful student and a member of the Eucleian Society, graduating in 1836.  Involvement with Morse's telegraph Visiting his alma mater on September 2, 1837, Vail happened to witness one of Samuel Morse's early telegraph experiments. He became fascinated by the technology and negotiated an arrangement with Morse to develop the technology at Speedwell Ironworks, at his own expense, in return for 25 of the proceeds. Alfred split his share with his brother George Vail. After having secured his father's financial backing, and being a skilled machinist, Vail refined Morse's crude prototype telegraph to make it suitable for public demonstration and commercial operation. The first successful completion of a transmission with this system was at the Speedwell Iron Works on January 6, 1838, across two miles of wire. The message read A patient waiter is no loser. Over the next few months Morse and Vail demonstrated the telegraph to Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, members of Congress, and President Martin Van Buren and his cabinet. Demonstrations such as these were crucial to Morse's obtaining a Congressional appropriation of 30,000 to build his first line in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore.  Retirement from telegraphy When Morse took on an influential congressman as a partner, Morse cut the Vail brothers' share to one eighth, although the other partners' shares were not reduced. Morse retained patent rights to all the apparatus and the alphabetic code system that Vail had developed. Vail retired from the telegraph operations in 1848 and moved back to Morristown, where he spent his last ten years researching genealogy. Since Alfred and his brother George shared a one eighth interest in Morse's telegraph patents, Vail realized far less financial gain from his work on the telegraph than Morse and others. His papers and equipment were subsequently donated by his son Stephen to the Smithsonian Institution and New Jersey Historical Society. Alfred Vail's cousin, Theodore N. Vail, became the first president of American Telephone Telegraph.  Morse code Alfred Vail and Samuel Morse collaborated in the invention of Morse code. The Morse code that went into operational use after Vail had become involved was very different from Morse's original plan. A controversy exists over the role of each in the invention. The argument for Vail being the original inventor is laid out by several scholars.The argument offered by supporters of Morse claims that Morse originally devised a cipher code similar to that used in existing semaphore line telegraphs, by which words were assigned three or four digit numbers and entered into a code book. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words through the same code book. Morse spent several months compiling this code dictionary. It is said by Morse supporters that Vail, in public and private writings, never claimed the code for himself. According to one researcher, in a February 1838 letter to his father, Judge Stephen Vail, Alfred wrote, Professor Morse has invented a new plan of an alphabet, and has thrown aside the Dictionaries. In an 1845 book Vail wrote describing Morse's telegraph, he also attributed the code to Morse.  Honors A U.S. Army base was named in Vail's honor: Camp Vail in Eatontown, New Jersey, later renamed Fort Monmouth, it was an Army housing complex. After World War II the families of servicemen and civilian Army employees negotiated with the Army to purchase the development, which they incorporated as the Alfred Vail Mutual Association . Due to the diligent efforts of the town clerk, the rights of the charter of the original Shrewsbury Township were transferred to the residents. The housing development exists under that name to this day. An elementary school in Morristown, New Jersey, near the site of the Speedwell Iron Works, is named Alfred Vail .

            "text": "Allis Chalmers was a U.S. manufacturer of machinery for various industries. Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company , Fraser Chalmers , the Gates Iron Works , and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company . It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis Chalmers Energy and AGCO.  History   Overview  Author photographer Randy Leffingwell aptly summarized the firm's origins and character. He observed that it grew by acquiring and consolidating the innovations of various smaller firms and building upon them; and he continued that Metal work and machinery were the common background. Financial successes and failures brought them together. Former marketing executive Walter M. Buescher said that Allis Chalmers was a conglomerate before the word was coined. Whether or not it is literally true that Allis Chalmers predated the sense of conglomerate meaning a widely diversified parent corporation, Buescher's point is valid: Allis Chalmers, despite its common theme of machinery, was an amalgamation of disparate business lines, each with a unique marketplace, beginning in an era when consolidations within industries were fashionable but those across industries were not yet common.  1800s to 1901  Edward P. Allis was an entrepreneur who in 1860 bought a bankrupt firm at a sheriff's auction, the Reliance Works of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had been owned by James Decker and Charles Seville. Decker Seville were millwrights who made equipment for flour milling. Under Allis's management, the firm was reinvigorated and began producing steam engines and other mill equipment just at the time that many sawmills and flour mills were converting to steam power. Although the financial panic of 1873 caught Edward Allis overextended and forced him into bankruptcy, his own reputation saved him and reorganization came quickly, forming the Edward P. Allis Company. Leffingwell said, He set out to hire known experts: George Hinkley, who perfected the band saw; William Gray, who revolutionized the flour milling process through roller milling; and Edwin Reynolds, who ran the Corliss Steam Engine works. Allis died in 1889, but under his sons and the other principals, the firm continued to prosper, and by 1900 it had grown to become one of America's largest steam engine builders. Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish immigrant to America who came to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour milling equipment. The Gates firm built the first steam operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country. In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement milling equipment. Another Scottish immigrant family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, they had organized a small machine shop and foundry in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 they were building boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors. By 1901 the principals of the Edward P. Allis, Fraser Chalmers, and Gates firms had decided to merge their companies. Edwin Reynolds believed Allis could control the industrial engine business. In May 1901 the Allis Chalmers Company was formed. It acquired Dickson's industrial engine business. Dickson's locomotive business was rolled into the new locomotive consolidation, the American Locomotive Company .  1901 1911  The managing director of the new company was Charles Allis, his brother William was chairman of the board, and William J. Chalmers was deputy managing director. Shortly after the merger was completed, a new factory was built in an area west of Milwaukee that was then known as North Greenfield. In 1902, with this new factory, the locale was renamed West Allis, Wisconsin. With the combining of the constituent firms, Allis Chalmers offered a wide array of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including skip cars, slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.In 1903, Allis Chalmers acquired the Bullock Electric Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, which added steam turbines to Allis Chalmers's powerplant equipment business line.  1912 1919  By 1912, the Allis Chalmers Company was in financial trouble, so it was reorganized. It was renamed the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company, and Otto Falk, a former Brigadier General of the Wisconsin National Guard, was appointed to turn it around. Falk pushed for new products and new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, which at the time was blossoming all over America. Allis Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10 18, the Model 6 12, and the Model 15 30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded.  1920s  As had also been true of the 1900 1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a favorable time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was also a time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18 30, the 12 20, the 15 25, and the United tractor Model U. Famed inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla spent the period 1919 1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis Chalmers.In 1926 Falk hired Harry Merritt, who would be a senior executive in Allis Chalmers's tractor business for many years. Merritt had worked in the sales and marketing of various brands of farm and construction equipment, most recently Holt, when Falk hired him away. Buescher, who worked under Merritt, credited Merritt with turning around Allis Chalmers's ailing farm equipment business and transforming it into the main profit center for the parent corporation. He said, Some say that General Falk pulled Harry Merritt into Milwaukee to liquidate the ailing tractor division. Others say that he was brought in to breathe new life into the moribund and unprofitable operation. Even if the first appraisal is correct, the second proved to be the way it turned out.  After Merritt's arrival, the profit picture changed. The farm equipment business proved to be a financial lifesaver for the corporation.  From next to nothing in 1927, Merritt saw the percentage of farm equipment business go to just short of sixty percent of corporate sales. Also in 1926, Allis Chalmers acquired Nordyke Marmon Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a maker of flour milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, a maker of electrical transformers. In 1928, Allis Chalmers acquired the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding a line of crawler tractors. In 1929, it acquired the La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him to think about the use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all red , Minneapolis Moline switched to Prairie Gold , and Case switched to Flambeau Red . John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow. In 1928, Henry Ford canceled U.S. production of the Fordson tractor. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons . Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, the onset of the Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis Chalmers Model U.  1930s  The 1930s were a pivotal decade. Despite the Great Depression, Allis Chalmers succeeded as demand for its machinery continued. In 1931, it acquired Advance Rumely of La Porte, Indiana, mostly because Merritt wanted the company's network of 24 branch houses and about 2,500 dealers, which would greatly increase Allis Chalmers's marketing and sales power in the farm equipment business. Also in 1931, the corporation's electrical equipment business expanded via acquisition when Brown, Boveri Cie, in a financial pinch because of the Depression, sold its U.S. electrical operations to Allis Chalmers. After 1931 Allis Chalmers was the licensee for U.S. sales of European products of Brown, Boveri Cie.In 1932, Allis Chalmers collaborated with Firestone to introduce pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry wide, as it improved tractive force and fuel economy in the range of 10 to 20 . Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line. In 1933, Allis Chalmers introduced its Model WC, its first generation row crop tractor, which would become its highest selling tractor ever. In 1937, its lighter and more affordable second generation row crop, the Model B, arrived, and also became a top seller. Its All Crop Harvester was the market leader in pull type combine harvesters. In October 1937, Allis Chalmers was one of fourteen major electrical manufacturing companies that went to court to change the way labor unions excluded contractors and products in the building trades through the union use of the Men and Means Clause . The action of Allis Chalmers and others eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision of June 18, 1945, that ended certain union practices that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  1940s  World War II caused Allis Chalmers, like most other manufacturing companies, to become extremely busy. As happened with many firms, its civilian product lines experienced a period of being on hold , with emphasis on parts and service to keep existing machines running, but its war materiel production was pushed to the maximum of productivity and output. In the late 1930s through mid 1940s, Allis Chalmers made machinery for naval ships, such as Liberty ship steam engines, steam turbines, generators, and electric motors; artillery tractors and tractors for other army use; electrical switches and controls; and other products. Allis Chalmers was also one of many firms contracted to build equipment for the Manhattan Project. Its experience in mining and milling machinery made it a logical choice for uranium mining and processing equipment. Allis Chalmers ranked 45th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.Immediately at the war's end, in 1945 1946, Allis Chalmers endured a crippling 11 month labor strike. Buescher was convinced that the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike. This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s. But it certainly gave competitors a chance to grab market share. After WWII some companies refused to sell equipment to Japanese farmers. Allis Chalmers dealers did not hesitate to sell to these farmers so many farms to this day still have an Allis Chalmers tractor in Oregon. In 1948, the Model WC was improved with various new features and became the Model WD, another top seller. The WD was a milestone for the company. It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two clutch system. It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard. Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.  1950s  The 1950s were a time of great demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater capability from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive dieselization, from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines, because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis Chalmers for construction equipment business. The Buda Lanova models were re christened the Allis Chalmers Diesel engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating and expanding the line. In 1952, the company acquired Laplant Choate, which added various models of scrapers to its construction equipment line. In 1953, the WD 45 was introduced, replacing the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests. This was almost double the horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from the seat of the tractor. A Buda diesel powered WD 45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D series in 1957. In 1955, the company acquired Gleaner Manufacturing Company, which was an important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull type combines, with its All Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented the All Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis Chalmers' profit. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition. In 1957, the Allis Chalmers D Series of tractors was introduced. It enjoyed great success over the next decade. In 1959, Allis Chalmers acquired the French company Vendeuvre. Also in 1959, it acquired Tractomotive Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois, which it had been partnering with as an auxiliary equipment supplier for at least a decade.In Haycraft's history of the construction equipment business , he expressed the view that Allis Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition and the need for subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often does not pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.  1960s and 1970s  In 1960, the U.S. government uncovered an attempt to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including the largest in the industry , with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy electrical cartel was that it was a desperate attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.The D series continued to be successful in the 1960s. The factory installed turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower . In 1965, Allis Chalmers acquired Simplicity for its line of lawn and garden equipment. Also in that year, the nuclear reactor SAFARI 1, a research reactor built by Allis Chalmers, went into operation.In the 1960s, the farm equipment, construction equipment, and heavy electrical industries were not as profitable for Allis Chalmers as they had been in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega conglomerates like Ling Temco Vought, Gulf Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case. In 1960, Allis Chalmers built the first grate kiln ore pellet plant at the Humboldt mine in Michigan. The company eventually built about 50 such plants.In 1974, Allis Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA, which bought a 65 majority stake at the outset. The new company was called Fiat Allis. In May 1975, the company closed its 20 acre, 78 year old Pittsburgh North Side factory that employed close to 1,100 full time and produced both distribution and instrument control transformers.In 1977, to compete in the recently expanding market segment of compact diesel utility tractors , Allis Chalmers began importing Hinomoto tractors with Toyosha diesel engines from Japan. They were rebadged with the Allis Chalmers brand for U.S. sales. In 1978, a joint venture with Siemens, Siemens Allis, was formed, supplying electrical control equipment.  1980s and 1990s  The company began to struggle in the 1980s in a climate of rapid economic change. It was forced amid financial struggles to sell major business lines. In 1983, Allis Chalmers sold Simplicity, the lawn and garden equipment division, to the division's management.1985 was a year of great dissolution for Allis Chalmers the year when it folded three of its main business lines: The Fiat Allis joint venture in construction equipment, over which the firms' managements had long since had a falling out, ended when Fiat bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. It renamed the company Fiatallis. The Allis Chalmers farm equipment business line ended when Allis sold it to K H D of Germany, at the time the owner of Deutz Fahr. K H D renamed the business as Deutz Allis and discarded the Allis Chalmers 8000 Series tractors and Persian Orange branding in favor of spring green tractors built by White Farm Equipment with Deutz air cooled engines. The Siemens Allis joint venture in electrical controls ended when Siemens bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. Siemens then blended the company into the Siemens Energy and Automation division.In 1988, Allis Chalmers sold its American Air Filter filtration business for approximately 225 million to SnyderGeneral Corporation of Dallas, a leading global air quality control firm. In 1990, Deutz Allis was sold to its management and became Allis Gleaner Corporation . Tractors began selling under the AGCO Allis name and were again painted Persian Orange. The AGCO brand of orange tractors was produced until 2011 when AGCO announced that it was phasing out the brand.In 1998, what remained of the Allis Chalmers manufacturing businesses were divested, and in January 1999, the company officially closed its Milwaukee offices. The remaining service businesses became Allis Chalmers Energy in Houston, Texas.  Brand reuse, 2000 to present  In August 2008, Briggs Stratton announced that it would sell lawn tractors under the Allis Chalmers brand name.

Tractor models  In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15kW fuel cell tractor for Allis Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This was the first fuel cell powered vehicle. Potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte. The original AC fuel cell tractor is currently on display at the Smithsonian. Below is a gallery showcasing some of the models that Allis Chalmers produced throughout its history, most of which are painted in their distinctive orange paint.          Balers  The first model introduced in 1949 was called the Roto Baler and the fore runner of modern round balers, albeit with much smaller bales. The Roto Baler was built until the 1960s or 1970s. Allis Chalmers also built many small square baler models.  Combine Harvesters  Allis Chalmers originally developed their pull type all crop harvester as their solution for growers to harvest their crops beginning in 1933. In 1955, Allis Chalmers acquired the Gleaner Baldwin Gleaner Manufacturing Company and its line of self propelled combine harvesters.   Industrial Construction Equipment The company produced several lines of earth moving and construction equipment ranging from: Road graders Tracked bulldozers Tracked loaders Forklifts Others    Industrial and power house equipment Allis Chalmers marketed a full line of Industrial and Power House equipment, including turbo generators and medium voltage switchgear. In the 1920s through the 1960s AC Power House and Industrial equipment was competitive with industry giants like General Electric and Westinghouse. As early as the 1920s AC was manufacturing multi MVA hydro electric generators and turbines, many of which remain in service today . Allis Chalmers manufactured several lines of medium voltage switchgear, such as the HF and MA lines. The HF line competed with the General Electric AM Magneblast line of vertical lift medium voltage switchgear. The MA line was a competitor of the ITE HK line of horizontal racking medium voltage switchgear. Allis Chalmers produced a line of substation transformers, voltage regulators, and distribution transformers. Allis Chalmers, during the period 1930 1965 and beyond, manufactured and marketed an extensive line of ore crushing equipment for the mining industry In 1965, Allis Chalmers built Big Allis, or Ravenswood No. 3, the biggest generator in New York. It is located in Queens, and has an output of 1000 MW. It is operational today.    Lawn and outdoor machinery In the late 1960s and early 1970s AC expanded into lawn and out door equipment.  All terrain vehicles  AC made a line of 6 wheeled Amphibious ATV's called the Terra Tiger .  Fuel cell golf carts  In 1965, Allis Chalmers built hydrogen fueled fuel cell golf carts.  Military machinery M1 tractor medium model HD7W M1 tractor heavy model HD10W M4 Tractor high speed 18 ton artillery tractor manufactured from 1943 M6 Tractor high speed 38 ton M7 Snow Tractor M19 snow trailer, 1 ton M50 Ontos a light anti tank vehicle, 297 units produced from 1955 to 1957 Steam turbines, Allis Chalmers built the steam turbines which powered the USS Coontz DLG 9 and some other ships of the same class used by the United States Navy.   Allis Chalmers Energy Allis Chalmers Energy is a Houston based multi faceted oilfield services company. Allis Chalmers provides services and equipment to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, both domestically and internationally.

            "text": "Almon Brown Strowger was an American inventor who gave his name to the Strowger switch, an electromechanical telephone exchange technology that his invention and patent inspired.  Early years Strowger was born in Penfield, New York, near Rochester, the grandson of the second settler and first miller in Penfield. Little is known about his early life. It is said that if his mother gave her children a task, Strowger and his brothers would often try to devise a machine to do the task for them. He taught school in Penfield for a time, and served in the 8th New York Volunteer Cavalry during the American Civil War. It is believed that he fought in the Second Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia. After the Civil War, it appears he first became a country school teacher before he became an undertaker. He is variously attributed as living in El Dorado, Kansas, or Topeka, Kansas, and finally Kansas City, Missouri. It is not clear where his idea of an automatic telephone exchange was originally conceived, but his patent application identifies him as being a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, on March 10, 1891.  Rotary dialing  Anecdotally, Strowger's undertaking business was losing clients to a competitor whose telephone operator wife was redirecting everyone who called for Strowger. Motivated to remove the intermediary operator, he invented the first automatic telephone exchange in 1889; he received its patent in 1891. It is reported that he initially constructed a model of his invention from a round collar box and some straight pins.  Finances While he may have come up with the idea, he was not alone in his endeavors and sought the assistance of his nephew William and others with a knowledge of electricity and money to realise his concepts. With this help the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company was formed and it installed and opened the first commercial exchange in La Porte, Indiana, on November 3, 1892, with about 75 subscribers and capacity for 99. He married Susan A. from Massachusetts in 1897 as his second wife. Strowger sold his patents to his associates in 1896 for 1,800 and sold his share in the Automatic Electric Company for 10,000 in 1898. His patents were subsequently sold to Bell Systems for 2.5 million in 1916 .The company's engineers continued development of Strowger's designs and submitted several patents in the names of its employees. It also underwent several name changes. Strowger himself seems to have not taken part in this further development. He subsequently moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, and appears to have returned to being an undertaker, as H.P. Bussey Funeral Home records report an unidentified body being moved for Mr. Strowger in December 1899. The same funeral home subsequently buried Strowger himself. Strowger was a man of some wealth at his death and was reported as owning at least a city block of property.  Death He died, aged 63, of an aneurysm after suffering from anemia, at St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, Florida, and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery the next day. His grave is marked with the traditional white headstone with an inscription that reads: Lieut. A.B. Strowger, Co. A, 8 NY Cav. He was survived by his widow Susan A. Strowger . After her death in Tampa, Florida, on April 14, 1921, her obituary appeared in the St. Petersburg Times, claiming she had additional revolutionary Strowger designs, but she had refused to make them public while she was alive because only others would profit from her husband's designs. She had claimed that her husband had only received 10,000 for his invention, when he should have received 1,000,000.  Legacy A bronze plaque, to commemorate his invention, was placed on his grave in 1945 by telephone company officials. Strowger was admitted to the hall of fame of the U.S. Independent Telephone Association in 1965. Apart from his invention, his name has also been given to a locomotive and a company business award. In 2003, the Verizon Foundation awarded 4500 to Pinellas Heritage, Inc. and the Pinellas Genealogy Society in Strowger's memory. The funds were used to develop a website to impart the history of the cemetery where Strowger is buried, and to restore two Civil War memorials. The Greenwood Cemetery project won an organization achievement award from the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.

            "text": "The American Institute of Electrical Engineers was a United States based organization of electrical engineers that existed from 1884 through 1962. On January 1, 1963, it merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers .  History  The 1884 founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers included some of the most prominent inventors and innovators in the then new field of electrical engineering, among them Nikola Tesla, Thomas Alva Edison, Elihu Thomson, Edwin J. Houston, and Edward Weston. The purpose of the AIEE was stated to promote the Arts and Sciences connected with the production and utilization of electricity and the welfare of those employed in these Industries: by means of social intercourse, the reading and discussion of professional papers and the circulation by means of publication among members and associates of information thus obtained. The first president of AIEE was Norvin Green, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Other notable AIEE presidents were Alexander Graham Bell , Charles Proteus Steinmetz , Bion J. Arnold , Schuyler S. Wheeler , Dugald C. Jackson , Ralph D. Mershon , Michael I. Pupin , and Titus G. LeClair . The first technical meeting of the AIEE was held during the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . After several years of operating primarily in New York City, the AIEE authorized local sections in 1902. These were formed first in the United States and then in other countries . The AIEE's regional structure was soon complemented by a technical structure the first technical committee of AIEE being formed in 1903. Standardization work started in 1891 with the formation of a committee on units and standards, followed by a committee on standard wiring. The formation of the AIEE Subcommittee on Large Scale Computing in 1946 was considered a key milestone in the history of computer engineering. It was the first time that a professional association recognized the significance of computers and computing in electro technology. The early technical areas of interest of AIEE were electric power, lighting, and wired communications. Radio and wireless communications became the major focus of a rival organization, the Institute of Radio Engineers . The dynamic growth of radio technology and the emergence of the new discipline of electronics in the 1940s led to stiff competition between AIEE and IRE, with IRE showing faster growth in the 1950s and early 1960s, and attracting more students. In 1957, the IRE, with approximately 55,500 members, surpassed the AIEE in membership size; by 1962 the IRE had 96,500 members to the AIEE's 57,000.  Institute's first logo After the AIEE's founding in 1884, its member's badge was created in 1893 by a committee headed by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, President of AIEE from 1891 to 1892. The badge's logo depicted Benjamin Franklin's kite, representative of the discovery that lightning carried electricity. The design also showed a winding of gold wire with its midpoints crossed by a galvanometer's indicator, invoking the electrical engineer's Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, Ohm's law and the letters 'AIEE' were added in gold at the logo's base. The busy logo design was replaced four years later.  Merger and evolution The AIEE and the IRE merged in 1963 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , in short order becoming the world's largest technical society.

            "text": "Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He was professor of astronomy at Uppsala University from 1730 to 1744, but traveled from 1732 to 1735 visiting notable observatories in Germany, Italy and France. He founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741, and in 1742 proposed the Centigrade temperature scale which was later renamed Celsius in his honour.  Early life and education Anders Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden, on 27 November 1701. His family originated from Ovan ker in the province of H lsingland. Their family estate was at Doma, also known as H jen or H gen . The name Celsius is a latinization of the estate's name . As the son of an astronomy professor, Nils Celsius, nephew of botanist Olof Celsius and the grandson of the mathematician Magnus Celsius and the astronomer Anders Spole, Celsius chose a career in science. He was a talented mathematician from an early age. Anders Celsius studied at Uppsala University, where his father was a teacher, and in 1730 he, too, became a professor of astronomy there. Noted Swedish dramatic poet and actor Johan Celsius was also his uncle.  Career In 1730, Celsius published the Nova Methodus distantiam solis a terra determinandi . His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant Olof Hiorter, and he was the first to suggest a connection between the aurora borealis and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth. He observed the variations of a compass needle and found that larger deflections correlated with stronger auroral activity. At Nuremberg in 1733, he published a collection of 316 observations of the aurora borealis made by himself and others over the period 1716 1732.Celsius traveled frequently in the early 1730s, including to Germany, Italy and France, when he visited most of the major European observatories. In Paris he advocated the measurement of an arc of the meridian in Lapland. In 1736, he participated in the expedition organized for that purpose by the French Academy of Sciences, led by the French mathematician Pierre Louis Maupertuis to measure a degree of latitude. The aim of the expedition was to measure the length of a degree along a meridian, close to the pole, and compare the result with a similar expedition to Peru, today in Ecuador, near the equator. The expeditions confirmed Isaac Newton's belief that the shape of the earth is an ellipsoid flattened at the poles. In 1738, he published the De observationibus pro figura telluris determinanda . Celsius's participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala. He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741. The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period.He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system . In 1742 he proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 0 for the boiling point of water and 100 for the freezing point. In 1745, a year after Celsius's death, the scale was reversed by Carl Linnaeus to facilitate more practical measurement. Celsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the melting of the ice from the latest ice age. However, he wrongly posed the notion that the water was evaporating.In 1725 he became secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and served at this post until his death from tuberculosis in 1744. He supported the formation of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1739 by Linnaeus and five others, and was elected a member at the first meeting of this academy. It was in fact Celsius who proposed the new academy's name.  Works  De novo in fluviis norlandiarum piscandi modo . Uppsala: Johan H jer, nka. 1738.

            "text": "Antonio Santi Giuseppe Meucci was an Italian inventor and an associate of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a major political figure in the history of Italy. Meucci is best known for developing a voice communication apparatus that several sources credit as the first telephone.Meucci set up a form of voice communication link in his Staten Island, New York, home that connected the second floor bedroom to his laboratory. He submitted a patent caveat for his telephonic device to the U.S. Patent Office in 1871, but there was no mention of electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound in his caveat. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the electromagnetic transmission of vocal sound by undulatory electric current. Despite the longstanding general crediting of Bell with the accomplishment, the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities supported celebrations of Meucci's 200th birthday in 2008 using the title Inventore del telefono . The U.S. House of Representatives in a resolution in 2002 also acknowledged Meucci's work in the invention of the telephone, although the U.S. Senate did not join the resolution and the interpretation of the resolution is disputed.  Early life Meucci was born at Via dei Serragli 44 in the San Frediano borough of Florence, First French Empire , on 13 April 1808, as the first of nine children to Amatis Meucci and Domenica Pepi. Amatis was at times a government clerk and a member of the local police, and Domenica was principally a homemaker. Four of Meucci's siblings did not survive childhood.In November 1821, at the age of 13, he was admitted to Florence Academy of Fine Arts as its youngest student, where he studied chemical and mechanical engineering. He ceased full time studies two years later due to insufficient funds, but continued studying part time after obtaining employment as an assistant gatekeeper and customs official for the Florentine government.In May 1825, because of the celebrations for the childbirth of Marie Anna of Saxony, wife of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Meucci conceived a powerful propellant mixture for flares. Unfortunately the fireworks went out of his control, causing damages and injuries in the celebration's square. Meucci was arrested and suspected of conspiracy against the Grand Duchy.Meucci later became employed at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence as a stage technician, assisting Artemio Canovetti.In 1834 Meucci constructed a type of acoustic telephone to communicate between the stage and control room at the Teatro of Pergola. This telephone was constructed on the principles of pipe telephones used on ships and still functions. He married costume designer Esterre Mochi, who was employed in the same theatre, on 7 August 1834.  Havana, Cuba In October 1835, Meucci and his wife emigrated to Cuba, then a Spanish province, where Meucci accepted a job at what was then called the Teatro Tac n in Havana . In Havana he constructed a system for water purification and reconstructed the Gran Teatro.In 1848 his contract with the governor expired. Meucci was asked by a friend's doctors to work on Franz Anton Mesmer's therapy system on patients with rheumatism. In 1849, he developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat illness and subsequently experimentally developed a device through which one could hear inarticulate human voice. He called this device telegrafo parlante .In 1850, the third renewal of Meucci's contract with Don Francisco Mart y Torrens expired, and his friendship with General Giuseppe Garibaldi made him a suspect citizen in Cuba. On the other hand, the fame reached by Samuel F. B. Morse in the United States encouraged Meucci to make his living through inventions.  Move to Staten Island, New York On 13 April 1850, Meucci and his wife emigrated to the United States, taking with them approximately 26,000 pesos fuertes in savings , and settled in the Clifton area of Staten Island, New York.The Meuccis would live there for the remainder of their lives. On Staten Island he helped several countrymen committed to the Italian unification movement and who had escaped political persecution. Meucci invested the substantial capital he had earned in Cuba into a tallow candle factory employing several Italian exiles. For two years Meucci hosted friends at his cottage, including General Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Colonel Paolo Bovi Campeggi, who arrived in New York two months after Meucci. They worked in Meucci's factory.In 1854, Meucci's wife Esterre became an invalid due to rheumatoid arthritis. Meucci continued his experiments.  Electromagnetic telephone Meucci studied the principles of electromagnetic voice transmission for many years and was able to transmit his voice through wires in 1856. He installed a telephone like device within his house in order to communicate with his wife, who was ill at the time. Some of Meucci's notes written in 1857 describe the basic principle of electromagnetic voice transmission or in other words, the telephone: Consiste in un diaframma vibrante e in un magnete elettrizzato da un filo a spirale che lo avvolge. Vibrando, il diaframma altera la corrente del magnete. Queste alterazioni di corrente, trasmesse all'altro capo del filo, imprimono analoghe vibrazioni al diaframma ricevente e riproducono la parola. Translated: It consists of a vibrating diaphragm and a magnet electrified by a spiral wire that wraps around it. The vibrating diaphragm alters the current of the magnet. These alterations of current, transmitted to the other end of the wire, create analogous vibrations of the receiving diaphragm and reproduce the word. Meucci devised an electromagnetic telephone as a way of connecting his second floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus being able to communicate with his wife. Between 1856 and 1870, Meucci developed more than 30 different kinds of telephones on the basis of this prototype. A postage stamp was produced in Italy in 2003 that featured a portrait of Meucci. Around 1858, artist Nestore Corradi sketched Meucci's communication concept. His drawing was used to accompany the stamp in a commemorative publication of the Italian Postal and Telegraph Society.Meucci intended to develop his prototype but did not have the financial means to keep his company afloat in order to finance his invention. His candle factory went bankrupt and Meucci was forced to unsuccessfully seek funds from rich Italian families. In 1860, he asked his friend Enrico Bandelari to look for Italian capitalists willing to finance his project. However, military expeditions led by Garibaldi in Italy had made the political situation in that country too unstable for anybody to invest.  Bankruptcy At the same time, Meucci was led to poverty by some fraudulent debtors. On 13 November 1861 his cottage was auctioned. The purchaser allowed the Meuccis to live in the cottage without paying rent, but Meucci's private finances dwindled and he soon had to live on public funds and by depending on his friends. As mentioned in William J. Wallace's ruling, during the years 1859 1861, Meucci was in close business and social relations with William E. Ryder, who invested money in Meucci's inventions and paid the expenses of his experiments. Their close working friendship continued until 1867.In August 1870, Meucci reportedly was able to capture a transmission of articulated human voice at the distance of a mile by using a copper plate as a conductor, insulated by cotton. He called this device the telettrofono . While he was recovering from injuries that befell him in a boiler explosion aboard a Staten Island ferry, the Westfield, Meucci's financial and health state was so bad that his wife sold his drawings and devices to a second hand dealer to raise money.  Patent caveat On 12 December 1871 Meucci set up an agreement with Angelo Zilio Grandi , Angelo Antonio Tremeschin , Sereno G.P. Breguglia Tremeschin , in order to constitute the Telettrofono Company. The constitution was notarized by Angelo Bertolino, a Notary Public of New York. Although their society funded him with 20, only 15 was needed to file for a full patent application. The caveat his lawyer submitted to the US Patent Office on 28 December 1871 was numbered 3335 and titled Sound Telegraph . The following is the text of Meucci's caveat, omitting legal details of the Petition, Oath, and Jurat:  Analysis of Meucci's caveat  Meucci repeatedly focused on insulating the electrical conductor and even insulating the people communicating, but does not explain why this would be desirable. The mouth piece is like a speaking trumpet so that the sound concentrated upon the wire is communicated to the other person, but he does not say that the sound is converted to variable electrical conduction in the wire. Another instrument is also applied to the ears , but he does not say that variable electrical conduction in the wire is to be converted to sound. In the third claim, he claims a sound conductor which is also an electrical conductor, as a means of communication by sound , which is consistent with acoustic sound vibrations in the wire that get transmitted better if electrical conductors such as a wire or metallic tube are used.Meucci emphasizes that the conductors for mouth and ears ... must be metallic , but does not explain why this would be desirable. He mentions communication with the ground but does not suggest that a ground return must complete a circuit if only the wire is used between the sender's mouth piece and the receiver's ear piece, with one or the other person being electrically insulated from the ground by means of glass insulators .Robert V. Bruce, a biographer of Bell, asserted that Meucci's caveat could never have become a patent because it never described an electric telephone.  Conflicting opinions of Meucci biographers  According to Robert V. Bruce, Meucci's own testimony as presented by Schiavo would demonstrate that the Italian inventor did not understand the basic principles of the electric telephone, either before Bell patented it, or for several years after Bell patented it.Other researchers have pointed to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Bruce's account of the invention of the telephone, firstly with the name used by Meucci to describe his invention Bruce referred to Meucci's device as a 'telephone', not as the 'telettrofono'. Bruce's reporting of Meucci's purported relationship with Dr. Seth R. Beckwith has been deemed inaccurate; Meucci and his legal representative had cautioned Beckwith against misusing Meucci's name for financial gain, vis vis the company Beckwith founded in New Jersey.Not only did Beckwith's Globe Telephone Co. base its claims against the Bell Telephone Company on Meucci's caveat, but the claims were also supported by approximately 30 affidavits, which stated that Meucci had repeatedly built and used different types of electric telephones several years before Bell did.English historian William Aitken does not share Robert V. Bruce's viewpoint. Bruce had indirectly referred to Meucci as the silliest and weakest impostor , while Aitken went so far as to define Meucci as the first creator of an electrical telephone.Other recognition of Meucci's work in the past came from the International Telecommunication Union, positing that Meucci's work was one of the four precursors to Bell's telephone, as well as from the Smithsonian Institution, which listed Meucci as one of the eight most important inventors of the telephone in a 1976 exhibit.Meucci and his business partners hired an attorney , who filed a caveat on behalf of Meucci with the patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the 250 fee, so all that was prepared was a caveat, since the fee for that was only 20. However, the caveat did not contain a clear description of how the asserted invention would actually function. Meucci advocates claim the attorney erased margin notes Meucci had added to the document.  Telettrofono Company  In 1872, Meucci and his friend Angelo Bertolino went to Edward B. Grant, Vice President of American District Telegraph Co. of New York , to ask for help. Meucci asked him for permission to test his apparatus on the company's telegraph lines. He gave Grant a description of his prototype and a copy of his caveat. After waiting two years, Meucci went to Grant and asked for his documents back, but Grant allegedly told him they had been lost.Around 1873, a man named Bill Carroll from Boston, who had news about Meucci's invention, asked him to construct a telephone for divers. This device should allow divers to communicate with people on the surface. In Meucci's drawing, this device is essentially an electromagnetic telephone encapsulated to be waterproof.On 28 December 1874, Meucci's Telettrofono patent caveat expired. Critics dispute the claim that Meucci could not afford to file for a patent or renew his caveat, as he filed for and was granted full patents in 1872, 1873, 1875, and 1876, at the cost of 35 each, as well as one additional 10 patent caveat, all totaling 150, for inventions unrelated to the telephone.After Bell secured his patents in 1876 and subsequent years, the Bell Telephone Company filed suit in court against the Globe Telephone Company for patent infringement. Purportedly too poor to hire a legal team, Meucci was represented only by lawyer Joe Melli, an orphan whom Meucci treated as his own son. While American Bell Telephone Company v. Globe Telephone Company, Antonio Meucci, et al. was still proceeding, Bell also became involved with The U.S. Government v. American Bell Telephone Company, instigated by the Pan Electric Telephone Company, which had secretly given Augustus Hill Garland the U.S. Attorney General 10 of its shares, employed him as a director, and then asked him to void Bell's patent. Had he succeeded in overturning Bell's patent, the U.S. Attorney General stood to become exceedingly rich by reason of his shares.  Trial  The Havana experiments were briefly mentioned in a letter by Meucci, published by Il Commercio di Genova of 1 December 1865 and by L'Eco d'Italia of 21 October 1865 .An important piece of evidence brought up in the trial was Meucci's Memorandum Book, which contained Meucci's noted drawings and records between 1862 and 1882. In the trial, Antonio Meucci was accused of having produced records after Bell's invention and back dated them. As proof, the prosecutor brought forward the fact that the Rider Clark company was founded only in 1863. At trial, Meucci said William E. Rider himself, one of the owners, had given him a copy of the memorandum book in 1862; however, Meucci was not believed.On 13 January 1887, the United States Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided. By the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles, the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents were no longer in effect, although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case's importance as a precedent . With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest arising from the original trial, the U.S. Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on 30 November 1897 leaving several issues undecided on the merits. During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Meucci claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834. In 1886, in the first of three cases in which he was involved, Meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention's priority. Meucci's evidence in this case was disputed due to lack of material evidence of his inventions as his working models were reportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph of New York. ADT did not merge with Western Union to become its subsidiary until 1901.Meucci's patent caveat had described a lover's telegraph, which transmitted sound vibrations mechanically across a taut wire, a conclusion that was also noted in various reviews Meucci's work, like many other inventors of the period, was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments, the final case involving Meucci was eventually dropped upon his death.  Death Meucci became ill in March 1889, and died on 18 October 1889 in Clifton, Staten Island, New York.  Invention of the telephone  There has been much dispute over who deserves recognition as the first inventor of the telephone, although Bell was credited with being the first to transmit articulate speech by undulatory currents of electricity. The Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica has devoted a museum to Meucci making a chronology of his inventing the telephone and tracing the history of the two trials opposing Meucci and Bell. They support the claim that Antonio Meucci was the real inventor of the telephone. However, some scholars outside Italy do not recognize the claims that Meucci's device had any bearing on the development of the telephone. Tomas Farley also writes that, Nearly every scholar agrees that Bell and Watson were the first to transmit intelligible speech by electrical means. Others transmitted a sound or a click or a buzz but our boys Bell and Watson were the first to transmit speech one could understand. In 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre Teatro della Pergola in Florence. This telephone was constructed on the model of pipe telephones on ships and is still functional.In 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat rheumatism. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci is claimed to have heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the tongue of copper wire vibrated just like a leave of an electroscope which meant there was an electrostatic effect. To continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he claimed to hear an unarticulated human voice. He called this device telegrafo parlante .On the basis of this prototype, some claim Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of telephones. In the beginning, he was inspired by the telegraph. Different from other pioneers of the telephone such as Charles Bourseul, Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti, and others he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph key . Instead, he looked for a continuous solution, meaning one that didn't interrupt the electric flux. In 1856, Meucci reportedly constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was housed in a cylindrical carton box. He purportedly constructed it to connect his second floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his invalid wife.Meucci separated the two directions of transmission to eliminate the so called local effect using what we would call today a four wire circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator that short circuited the instrument of the calling person to make a succession of impulses that were louder than normal conversation. Aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so called skin effect through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material .In 1864, Meucci claimed to have made what he felt was his best device, using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. In August 1870, Meucci reportedly obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper wire insulated by cotton. He called his device telettrofono . Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci with a claimed date of 27 September 1870 show that Meucci understood inductive loading on long distance telephone lines 30 years before any other scientists. The question of whether Bell was the true inventor of the telephone is perhaps the single most litigated fact in U.S. history, and the Bell patents were defended in some 600 cases. Meucci was a defendant in American Bell Telephone Co. v. Globe Telephone Co. and others .In his History of the Telephone, Herbert Newton Casson wrote: To bait the Bell Company became almost a national sport. Any sort of claimant, with any sort of wild tale of prior invention, could find a speculator to support him. On they came, a motley array, 'some in rags, some on nags, and some in velvet gowns.' One of them claimed to have done wonders with an iron hoop and a file in 1867; a second had a marvellous table with glass legs; a third swore that he had made a telephone in 1860, but did not know what it was until he saw Bell's patent; and a fourth told a vivid story of having heard a bullfrog croak via a telegraph wire which was strung into a certain cellar in Racine, in 1851. Judge Wallace's ruling was bitterly regarded by historian Giovanni Schiavo as a miscarriage of justice.  2002 U.S. Congressional resolution  In 2002, on the initiative of U.S. Representative Vito Fossella , in cooperation with an Italian American deputation, the U.S. House of Representatives passed United States HRes. 269 on Antonio Meucci stating that the life and achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged. According to the preamble, if Meucci had been able to pay the 10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell. The resolution's sponsor described it as a message that rings loud and clear recognizing the true inventor of the telephone, Antonio Meucci. In 2002, some news articles reported that the resolution said his 'telettrofono', demonstrated in New York in 1860, made him the inventor of the telephone in the place of Bell, who took out a patent 16 years later. A similar resolution was introduced to the U.S. Senate but no vote was held on the resolution.Despite the House of Representatives resolution, its interpretation as supporting Meucci's claim as the inventor of the telephone remains disputed, as the resolution only referred to his work in the invention of the telephone rather than a direct assertion that he was the inventor of the telephone.The House of Commons of Canada responded ten days later by unanimously passing a parliamentary motion stating that Alexander Graham Bell was the inventor of the telephone.The Italian newspaper La Repubblica hailed the vote to recognize Meucci as a belated comeuppance for Bell.  Garibaldi Meucci Museum  The Order of the Sons of Italy in America maintains a Garibaldi Meucci Museum on Staten Island. The museum is located in a house that was built in 1840, purchased by Meucci in 1850, and rented to Giuseppe Garibaldi from 1850 to 1854. Exhibits include Meucci's models and drawing and pictures relating to his life.

The Tangled Web of Patent 174465 Pub: AuthorHouse 2009, 347pp. Pizer's book contains 37 illustrations. Of extreme importance is research via the 1971 Ph.D. dissertation of Dr. Rosario Tosiello who's PhD advisor at Boston University was Robert V. Bruce the 1973 author of Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solute. The ' Tangled Web of Patent 174465 shows that A. G. Bell did not ever file a patent for the telephone and the Patent 174465 did not mention the word telephone. The patent application was submitted by Attorney Pollok at the insistence of A. G. Bell's soon to be father in law, Gradiner Green Hubbard. A. G. Bell was unaware Anthony Pollock had submitted the application at the time of its submission.

            "text": "An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc . The carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for most of these purposes, but it is still used as a source of high intensity ultraviolet light. The term is now used for gas discharge lamps, which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through a gas in a glass bulb. The common fluorescent lamp is a low pressure mercury arc lamp. The xenon arc lamp, which produces a high intensity white light, is now used in many of the applications which formerly used the carbon arc, such as movie projectors and searchlights.  Operation An arc is the discharge that occurs when a gas is ionized. A high voltage is pulsed across the lamp to ignite or strike the arc, after which the discharge can be maintained at a lower voltage. The strike requires an electrical circuit with an igniter and a ballast. The ballast is wired in series with the lamp and performs two functions. First, when the power is first switched on, the igniter starter sets up a small current through the ballast and starter. This creates a small magnetic field within the ballast windings. A moment later the starter interrupts the current flow from the ballast, which has a high inductance and therefore tries to maintain the current flow ; it cannot, as there is no longer a 'circuit'. As a result, a high voltage appears across the ballast momentarily, to which the lamp is connected; therefore the lamp receives this high voltage across it which 'strikes' the arc within the tube lamp. The circuit will repeat this action until the lamp is ionized enough to sustain the arc. When the lamp sustains the arc, the ballast performs its second function, to limit the current to that needed to operate the lamp. The lamp, ballast and igniter are rating matched to each other; these parts must be replaced with the same rating as the failed component or the lamp will not work. The colour of the light emitted by the lamp changes as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Lightning is a similar principle where the atmosphere is ionized by the high potential difference between earth and storm clouds. The temperature of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose their power supply, one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes . However, some lamps can be restruck as soon as they are turned off . The Vortek water wall plasma arc lamp, invented in 1975 by David Camm and Roy Nodwell at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1986 and 1993 as the most powerful continuously burning light source at over 300 kW or 1.2 million candle power.  Carbon arc lamp  In popular use, the term arc lamp means carbon arc lamp only. In a carbon arc lamp, the electrodes are carbon rods in free air. To ignite the lamp, the rods are touched together, thus allowing a relatively low voltage to strike the arc. The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the carbon rods are heated and the carbon vaporizes. The carbon vapor in the arc is highly luminous, which is what produces the bright light. The rods are slowly burnt away in use, and the distance between them needs to be regularly adjusted in order to maintain the arc.Many ingenious mechanisms were invented to affect the distance automatically, mostly based on solenoids. In one of the simplest mechanically regulated forms the electrodes are mounted vertically. The current supplying the arc is passed in series through a solenoid attached to the top electrode. If the points of the electrodes are touching the resistance falls, the current increases and the increased pull from the solenoid draws the points apart. If the arc starts to fail the current drops and the points close up again. The Yablochkov candle is a simple arc lamp without a regulator, but it has the drawbacks that the arc cannot be restarted and a limited lifetime of only a few hours.  History The concept of carbon arc lighting was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in the early 19th century, but sources disagree about the year he first demonstrated it; 1802, 1805, 1807 and 1809 are all mentioned. Davy used charcoal sticks and a two thousand cell battery to create an arc across a 4 inch gap. He mounted his electrodes horizontally and noted that, because of the strong convection flow of air, the arc formed the shape of an arch. He coined the term arch lamp , which was contracted to arc lamp when the devices came into common usage.In the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for The Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers . Her paper was The Hissing of the Electric Arc .The arc lamp provided one of the first commercial uses for electricity, a phenomenon previously confined to experiment, the telegraph, and entertainment.  Carbon arc lighting in the U.S.  In the United States, there were attempts to produce arc lamps commercially after 1850, but the lack of a constant electricity supply thwarted efforts. Thus electrical engineers began focusing on the problem of improving Faraday's dynamo. The concept was improved upon by a number of people including William Edwards Staite and Charles F. Brush. It was not until the 1870s that lamps such as the Yablochkov candle were more commonly seen. In 1877, the Franklin Institute conducted a comparative test of dynamo systems. The one developed by Brush performed best, and Brush immediately applied his improved dynamo to arc lighting, an early application being Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Despite this, Wabash, Indiana claims to be the first city ever to be lit with Brush Lights . Four of these lights became active there on March 31, 1880. Wabash, IN Wabash was a small enough city to be lit entirely by 4 lights, whereas the installation at Cleveland's Public Square only lit a portion of that larger city. Brush Lights, Cleveland In 1880, Brush established the Brush Electric Company. The harsh and brilliant light was found most suitable for public areas, such as Cleveland's Public Square, being around 200 times more powerful than contemporary filament lamps. The usage of Brush electric arc lights spread quickly. Scientific American reported in 1881 that the system was being used in: 800 lights in rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 lights in woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 lights in large stores, hotels, churches, 250 lights in parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 lights in railroad depots and shops, 130 lights in mines, smelting works, 380 lights in factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 lights in lighting stations, for city lighting, 1,200 lights in England and other foreign countries. A total of over 6,000 lights which are actually sold. There were three major advances in the 1880s: Franti ek K i k invented in 1880 a mechanism to allow the automatic adjustment of the electrodes. The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption . Flame arc lamps were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts added to increase light output and produce different colours. In the U.S., patent protection of arc lighting systems and improved dynamos proved difficult and as a result the arc lighting industry became highly competitive. Brush's principal competition was from the team of Elihu Thomson and Edwin J. Houston. These two had formed the American Electric Corporation in 1880, but it was soon bought up by Charles A. Coffin, moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, and renamed the Thomson Houston Electric Company. Thomson remained, though, the principal inventive genius behind the company patenting improvements to the lighting system. Under the leadership of Thomson Houston's patent attorney, Frederick P. Fish, the company protected its new patent rights. Coffin's management also led the company towards an aggressive policy of buy outs and mergers with competitors. Both strategies reduced competition in the electrical lighting manufacturing industry. By 1890, the Thomson Houston company was the dominant electrical manufacturing company in the U.S. Nikola Tesla received U.S. Patent 447920, Method of Operating Arc Lamps , that describes a 10,000 cycles per second alternator to suppress the disagreeable sound of power frequency harmonics produced by arc lamps operating on frequencies within the range of human hearing. Around the turn of the century arc lighting systems were in decline, but Thomson Houston controlled key patents to urban lighting systems. This control slowed the expansion of incandescent lighting systems being developed by Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company. Conversely, Edison's control of direct current distribution and generating machinery patents blocked further expansion of Thomson Houston. The roadblock to expansion was removed when the two companies merged in 1892 to form the General Electric Company.Arc lamps were used in some early motion picture studios to illuminate interior shots. One problem was that they produce such a high level of ultra violet light that many actors needed to wear sunglasses when off camera to relieve sore eyes resulting from the ultra violet light. The problem was solved by adding a sheet of ordinary window glass in front of the lamp, blocking the ultra violet. By the dawn of the talkies , arc lamps had been replaced in film studios with other types of lights. In 1915, Elmer Ambrose Sperry began manufacturing his invention of a high intensity carbon arc searchlight. These were used aboard warships of all navies during the 20th century for signaling and illuminating enemies. In the 1920s, carbon arc lamps were sold as family health products, a substitute for natural sunlight.Arc lamps were superseded by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche applications such as cinema projection, spotlights, and searchlights. Even in these applications conventional carbon arc lamps are being pushed into obsolescence by xenon arc lamps, but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured for at least one purpose simulating sunlight in accelerated aging machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.The practice of shipping and projecting motion pictures on 2,000 foot reels, and employing changeovers between two projectors, was due to the carbon rods used in projector lamphouses having a lifespan of roughly 22 minutes . The projectionist would replace the carbon rod when changing film reels. The two projector changeover setup largely disappeared in the 1970s with the advent of xenon projector lamps, being replaced with single projector platter systems, though films would continue to be shipped to cinemas on 2,000 foot reels.

            "text": "Arthur Brisbane was one of the best known American newspaper editors of the 20th century as well as a real estate investor. He was also a speech writer, orator, and public relations professional who coached many famous businesspeople of his time in the field of public relations, particularly Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and John D. Rockefeller.  Biography Brisbane was born in Buffalo, New York to Albert Brisbane , an American utopian socialist who is remembered as the chief popularizer of the theories of Charles Fourier in the United States. Albert was the author of several books, including Social Destiny of Man , as well as the Fourierist periodical The Phalanx. He also founded the Fourierist Society in New York in 1839 and backed several other phalanx communes in the 1840s and 1850s. Arthur was educated in the United States and Europe.  Career In 1882, he began work as a newspaper reporter and editor in New York City, first at the Sun and later Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. Hired away from Pulitzer by William Randolph Hearst, he became editor of the New York Journal and Hearst's close friend. His syndicated editorial column had an estimated daily readership of over 20 million, according to Time magazine. In 1897, he accepted the editorship of the Evening Journal, flagship of the Hearst chain, and through it gained influence unmatched by any editor in the United States. His direct and forceful style influenced the form of American editorial and news writing. The saying, If you don't hit the reader between the eyes in your first sentence of your news column, there's no need to write any more, is attributed to him. Hearst biographer W. A. Swanberg described Brisbane as a one time socialist who had drifted pleasantly into the profit system... in some respects a vest pocket Hearst a personal enigma, a workhorse, a madman for circulation, a liberal who had grown conservative, an investor. While an employee of Hearst at one point boasting of making 260,000 in a year Brisbane also was known for buying failing newspapers, re organizing them, and selling them to Hearst. He bought The Washington Times and the Milwaukee Evening Wisconsin in 1918 and sold both to Hearst 15 months later. He later bought the Detroit Times on behalf of Hearst.Brisbane was accused of engaging in yellow journalism having published an editorial that called for the assassination of President McKinley. Although the article was pulled by Hearst after the first edition, many still blamed Hearst's journalists for provoking Leon Czolgosz to commit the fatal act.In 1918, he became editor of the Chicago Herald and Examiner, and in the 1920s became editor of Hearst's first tabloid, the New York Mirror. He remained part of the Hearst media empire until his death in 1936. His daughter Sarah married one of his Daily Mirror employees, Tex McCrary, who later became a radio TV personality with second wife Jinx Falkenburg. A 1926 Time magazine cover story described his influence like this: The New York American, the Chicago Herald Examiner, the San Francisco Examiner and many another newspaper owned by Publisher Hearst, to say nothing of some 200 non Hearst dailies and 800 country weeklies which buy syndicated Brisbane, all publish what Mr. Brisbane has said. His column is headed, with simple finality, Today, a column that vies with the weather and market reports for the size of its audience, probably beating both. It is said to be read by a third of the total U. S. population. Obviously this is an exaggeration, but half that many would be some 20 million readers, Today and every day. Several volumes of Brisbane's editorials were published, including The Book of Today, The Book of Today and the Future Day, and The Brisbane advertising philosophy. At the time of his death, he was considered the virtual executive director of the Hearst news and media empire. From 1924 until 1935, artist Mel Cummin originated and drew many of the big, eight column cartoons for Brisbane's editorials in the New York Sunday American, the New York Evening Journal and occasionally The Mirror. Cummin, a well known member of the Explorer's Club, called Brisbane a well informed naturalist, and said the two collaborators discussed the subject of naturalism frequently.  Real estate With Hearst, he formed Hearst Brisbane Properties, investing heavily in New York real estate and developing projects such as the Ziegfeld Theatre, the Warwick Hotel, and the Ritz Tower. He was instrumental in preserving a large section of land he had amassed in central New Jersey along the Jersey Shore between 1907 and 1936. It was here that Brisbane built his dream house, a palatial mansion for its time, adjacent to a lake, and complete with a library tower. It was also here that Brisbane and his family could enjoy their favorite sport horse back riding. Brisbane transformed the Allaire area from a near deserted village to a luxurious country estate, complete with a state of the art horse farm, Allaire Inn, toy factory, a camp for Boy Scouts, and training grounds during the war years. He used his professional connections to bring silent film companies to his property at Allaire, which was used as a backdrop. He even opened up his estate during the Great Depression to New Deal work programs. Brisbane and his family realized enjoyment at Allaire and considered it his final abode. He employed a large staff to take care of his property at Allaire, which at one time was boasted to occupy 10,000 acres . The actual count was closer to 6,000 acres . Brisbane eventually began to explore the history of his property at Allaire and became aware in the 1920s of its great historic significance. His Allaire property was formerly James P. Allaire's Howell Iron Works Company, a thriving iron making industrial village of the early 19th century. As early as 1925, Brisbane sought to preserve this property, with its vast natural resources and 19th century era village buildings. Although not completed before his death, it was left to his wife, Phoebe Cary Brisbane and her immediate family to fulfill Arthur Brisbane's wishes of donating nearly 1,200 acres to the State of New Jersey by 1944, including James P. Allaire's 19th century industrial village. The deed of gift contained stipulations that it was to be used for historic and forest reservation purposes, and for nothing else. Moreover, the Brisbane family home served as the Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center until its recent closure in 2005. The original Brisbane gift of land, 1,200 acres , forms the heart of Allaire State Park. Its historic village is dedicated to portraying the life and times of James P. Allaire's Howell Iron Works Company largely through the non profit educational organization, Allaire Village Inc. Efforts were pushed forward at the Historic Village at Allaire in 2006 by Allaire historian Hance M. Sitkus to better interpret Brisbane's career, family, and generosity, focusing on Brisbane as an often overlooked humanitarian and philanthropist.  Personal life  Brisbane was married to Phoebe Cary , the eldest daughter of polo player Seward Cary and the former Emily Lisle Scatcherd. Phoebe's paternal great grandfather, New York State Senator Trumbull Cary, was married to Brisbane's aunt, Margaret Elinor Brisbane. Together, they were the parents of six children: Sarah Brisbane McCrary Mellen Seward Brisbane Hugo Brisbane Emily Brisbane Alice Brisbane Chandor Tooker , married Lt. Elbert Haring Chandor in 1944 Elinor Brisbane Kelley Philbin He died in Manhattan on Christmas Day, December 25, 1936 and was buried in the Batavia Cemetery at Batavia, New York.His grandson, Arthur S. Brisbane, was appointed Public Editor of The New York Times in June 2010.  Impact  At his death, Hearst said, I know that Arthur Brisbane was the greatest journalist of his day, and Damon Runyon said Journalism has lost its all time No. 1 genius.

            "text": "Atmospheric electricity is the study of electrical charges in the Earth's atmosphere . The movement of charge between the Earth's surface, the atmosphere, and the ionosphere is known as the global atmospheric electrical circuit. Atmospheric electricity is an interdisciplinary topic with a long history, involving concepts from electrostatics, atmospheric physics, meteorology and Earth science.Thunderstorms act as a giant battery in the atmosphere, charging up the electrosphere to about 400,000 volts with respect to the surface. This sets up an electric field throughout the atmosphere, which decreases with increase in altitude. Atmospheric ions created by cosmic rays and natural radioactivity move in the electric field, so a very small current flows through the atmosphere, even away from thunderstorms. Near the surface of the Earth, the magnitude of the field is on average around 100 V m.Atmospheric electricity involves both thunderstorms, which create lightning bolts to rapidly discharge huge amounts of atmospheric charge stored in storm clouds, and the continual electrification of the air due to ionization from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity, which ensure that the atmosphere is never quite neutral.  History  Sparks drawn from electrical machines and from Leyden jars suggested to early experimenters Hauksbee, Newton, Wall, Nollet, and Gray that lightning was caused by electric discharges. In 1708, Dr. William Wall was one of the first to observe that spark discharges resembled miniature lightning, after observing the sparks from a charged piece of amber. Benjamin Franklin's experiments showed that electrical phenomena of the atmosphere were not fundamentally different from those produced in the laboratory, by listing many similarities between electricity and lightning. By 1749, Franklin observed lightning to possess almost all the properties observable in electrical machines. In July 1750, Franklin hypothesized that electricity could be taken from clouds via a tall metal aerial with a sharp point. Before Franklin could carry out his experiment, in 1752 Thomas Fran ois Dalibard erected a 40 foot iron rod at Marly la Ville, near Paris, drawing sparks from a passing cloud. With ground insulated aerials, an experimenter could bring a grounded lead with an insulated wax handle close to the aerial, and observe a spark discharge from the aerial to the grounding wire. In May 1752, Dalibard affirmed that Franklin's theory was correct. Around June 1752, Franklin reportedly performed his famous kite experiment. The kite experiment was repeated by Romas, who drew from a metallic string sparks 9 feet long, and by Cavallo, who made many important observations on atmospheric electricity. Lemonnier also reproduced Franklin's experiment with an aerial, but substituted the ground wire with some dust particles . He went on to document the fair weather condition, the clear day electrification of the atmosphere, and its diurnal variation. Beccaria confirmed Lemonnier's diurnal variation data and determined that the atmosphere's charge polarity was positive in fair weather. Saussure recorded data relating to a conductor's induced charge in the atmosphere. Saussure's instrument was a precursor to the electrometer. Saussure found that the atmospheric electrification under clear weather conditions had an annual variation, and that it also varied with height. In 1785, Coulomb discovered the electrical conductivity of air. His discovery was contrary to the prevailing thought at the time, that the atmospheric gases were insulators . Erman theorized that the Earth was negatively charged, and Peltier tested and confirmed Erman's idea. Several researchers contributed to the growing body of knowledge about atmospheric electrical phenomena. Francis Ronalds began observing the potential gradient and air earth currents around 1810, including making continuous automated recordings. He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, where the first extended and comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters was created. He also supplied his equipment to other facilities around the world with the goal of delineating atmospheric electricity on a global scale. Kelvin's new water dropper collector and divided ring electrometer were introduced at Kew Observatory in the 1860s, and atmospheric electricity remained a speciality of the observatory until its closure. For high altitude measurements, kites were once used, and weather balloons or aerostats are still used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even went aloft themselves in hot air balloons. Hoffert identified individual lightning downward strokes using early cameras. Elster and Geitel, who also worked on thermionic emission, proposed a theory to explain thunderstorms' electrical structure and, later, discovered atmospheric radioactivity from the existence of positive and negative ions in the atmosphere. Pockels estimated lightning current intensity by analyzing lightning flashes in basalt and studying the left over magnetic fields caused by lightning. Discoveries about the electrification of the atmosphere via sensitive electrical instruments and ideas on how the Earth's negative charge is maintained were developed mainly in the 20th century, with CTR Wilson playing an important part. Current research on atmospheric electricity focuses mainly on lightning, particularly high energy particles and transient luminous events, and the role of non thunderstorm electrical processes in weather and climate.  Description Atmospheric electricity is always present, and during fine weather away from thunderstorms, the air above the surface of Earth is positively charged, while the Earth's surface charge is negative. This can be understood in terms of a difference of potential between a point of the Earth's surface, and a point somewhere in the air above it. Because the atmospheric electric field is negatively directed in fair weather, the convention is to refer to the potential gradient, which has the opposite sign and is about 100 V m at the surface, away from thunderstorms. There is a weak conduction current of atmospheric ions moving in the atmospheric electric field, about 2 picoamperes per square meter, and the air is weakly conductive due to the presence of these atmospheric ions.  Variations  Global daily cycles in the atmospheric electric field, with a minimum around 03 UT and peaking roughly 16 hours later, were researched by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the 20th century. This Carnegie curve variation has been described as the fundamental electrical heartbeat of the planet .Even away from thunderstorms, atmospheric electricity can be highly variable, but, generally, the electric field is enhanced in fogs and dust whereas the atmospheric electrical conductivity is diminished.  Links with biology  The atmospheric potential gradient leads to an ion flow from the positively charged atmosphere to the negatively charged earth surface. Over a flat field on a day with clear skies, the atmospheric potential gradient is approximately 120 V m. Objects protruding these fields, e.g. flowers and trees, can increase the electric field strength to several kilovolts per meter. These near surface electrostatic forces are detected by organisms such as the bumblebee to navigate to flowers and the spider to initiate dispersal by ballooning. The atmospheric potential gradient is also thought to affect sub surface electro chemistry and microbial processes.  Near space  The electrosphere layer has a high electrical conductivity and is essentially at a constant electric potential. The ionosphere is the inner edge of the magnetosphere and is the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation.   Cosmic radiation  The Earth, and almost all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside the Solar System. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of secondary ionising radiation, including X rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, and electrons. Ionization from this secondary radiation ensures that the atmosphere is weakly conductive, and the slight current flow from these ions over the Earth's surface balances the current flow from thunderstorms. Ions have characteristic parameters such as mobility, lifetime, and generation rate that vary with altitude.  Thunderstorms and lightning  The potential difference between the ionosphere and the Earth is maintained by thunderstorms, with lightning strikes delivering negative charges from the atmosphere to the ground. Collisions between ice and soft hail inside cumulonimbus clouds causes separation of positive and negative charges within the cloud, essential for the generation of lightning. How lightning initially forms is still a matter of debate: Scientists have studied root causes ranging from atmospheric perturbations to the impact of solar wind and energetic particles. An average bolt of lightning carries a negative electric current of 40 kiloamperes , and transfers a charge of five coulombs and energy of 500 MJ, or enough energy to power a 100 watt lightbulb for just under two months. The voltage depends on the length of the bolt, with the dielectric breakdown of air being three million volts per meter, and lightning bolts often being several hundred meters long. However, lightning leader development is not a simple matter of dielectric breakdown, and the ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can be a few orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength. Further, the potential gradient inside a well developed return stroke channel is on the order of hundreds of volts per meter or less due to intense channel ionization, resulting in a true power output on the order of megawatts per meter for a vigorous return stroke current of 100 kA .If the quantity of water that is condensed in and subsequently precipitated from a cloud is known, then the total energy of a thunderstorm can be calculated. In an average thunderstorm, the energy released amounts to about 10,000,000 kilowatt hours , which is equivalent to a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead. A large, severe thunderstorm might be 10 to 100 times more energetic.  Corona discharges  St. Elmo's Fire is an electrical phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a coronal discharge originating from a grounded object. Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's Fire, whereas they are separate and distinct phenomena. Although referred to as fire , St. Elmo's Fire is, in fact, plasma, and is observed, usually during a thunderstorm, at the tops of trees, spires or other tall objects, or on the heads of animals, as a brush or star of light. Corona is caused by the electric field around the object in question ionizing the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low light conditions. Approximately 1,000 30,000 volts per centimeter is required to induce St. Elmo's Fire; however, this is dependent on the geometry of the object in question. Sharp points tend to require lower voltage levels to produce the same result because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature, thus discharges are more intense at the end of pointed objects. St. Elmo's Fire and normal sparks both can appear when high electrical voltage affects a gas. St. Elmo's fire is seen during thunderstorms when the ground below the storm is electrically charged, and there is high voltage in the air between the cloud and the ground. The voltage tears apart the air molecules and the gas begins to glow. The nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere causes St. Elmo's Fire to fluoresce with blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon signs to glow.  Earth Ionosphere cavity  The Schumann resonances are a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acting as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes.  Electrical system grounding  Atmospheric charges can cause undesirable, dangerous, and potentially lethal charge potential buildup in suspended electric wire power distribution systems. Bare wires suspended in the air spanning many kilometers and isolated from the ground can collect very large stored charges at high voltage, even when there is no thunderstorm or lightning occurring. This charge will seek to discharge itself through the path of least insulation, which can occur when a person reaches out to activate a power switch or to use an electric device. To dissipate atmospheric charge buildup, one side of the electrical distribution system is connected to the earth at many points throughout the distribution system, as often as on every support pole. The one earth connected wire is commonly referred to as the protective earth , and provides path for the charge potential to dissipate without causing damage, and provides redundancy in case any one of the ground paths is poor due to corrosion or poor ground conductivity. The additional electric grounding wire that carries no power serves a secondary role, providing a high current short circuit path to rapidly blow fuses and render a damaged device safe, rather than have an ungrounded device with damaged insulation become electrically live via the grid power supply, and hazardous to touch. Each transformer in an alternating current distribution grid segments the grounding system into a new separate circuit loop. These separate grids must also be grounded on one side to prevent charge buildup within them relative to the rest of the system, and which could cause damage from charge potentials discharging across the transformer coils to the other grounded side of the distribution network.

            "text": "In computing, bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth.This definition of bandwidth is in contrast to the field of signal processing, wireless communications, modem data transmission, digital communications, and electronics, in which bandwidth is used to refer to analog signal bandwidth measured in hertz, meaning the frequency range between lowest and highest attainable frequency while meeting a well defined impairment level in signal power. The actual bit rate that can be achieved depends not only on the signal bandwidth but also on the noise on the channel.  Network capacity The term bandwidth sometimes defines the net bit rate 'peak bit rate', 'information rate,' or physical layer 'useful bit rate', channel capacity, or the maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path in a digital communication system. For example, bandwidth tests measure the maximum throughput of a computer network. The maximum rate that can be sustained on a link is limited by the Shannon Hartley channel capacity for these communication systems, which is dependent on the bandwidth in hertz and the noise on the channel.  Network consumption The consumed bandwidth in bit s, corresponds to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The consumed bandwidth can be affected by technologies such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap, bandwidth allocation , etc. A bit stream's bandwidth is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz during a studied time interval. Channel bandwidth may be confused with useful data throughput . For example, a channel with x bps may not necessarily transmit data at x rate, since protocols, encryption, and other factors can add appreciable overhead. For instance, much internet traffic uses the transmission control protocol , which requires a three way handshake for each transaction. Although in many modern implementations the protocol is efficient, it does add significant overhead compared to simpler protocols. Also, data packets may be lost, which further reduces the useful data throughput. In general, for any effective digital communication, a framing protocol is needed; overhead and effective throughput depends on implementation. Useful throughput is less than or equal to the actual channel capacity minus implementation overhead.  Maximum throughput The asymptotic bandwidth for a network is the measure of maximum throughput for a greedy source, for example when the message size approaches close to the maximum amount.Asymptotic bandwidths are usually estimated by sending a number of very large messages through the network, measuring the end to end throughput. As with other bandwidths, the asymptotic bandwidth is measured in multiples of bits per seconds. Since bandwidth spikes can skew the measurement, carriers often use the 95th percentile method. This method continuously measures bandwidth usage and then removes the top 5 percent.  Multimedia Digital bandwidth may also refer to: multimedia bit rate or average bitrate after multimedia data compression , defined as the total amount of data divided by the playback time. Due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed digital media, the required multimedia bandwidth can be significantly reduced with data compression. The most widely used data compression technique for media bandwidth reduction is the discrete cosine transform , which was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in the early 1970s. DCT compression significantly reduces the amount of memory and bandwidth required for digital signals, capable of achieving a data compression ratio of up to 100:1 compared to uncompressed media.  Web hosting In Web hosting service, the term bandwidth is often incorrectly used to describe the amount of data transferred to or from the website or server within a prescribed period of time, for example bandwidth consumption accumulated over a month measured in gigabytes per month. The more accurate phrase used for this meaning of a maximum amount of data transfer each month or given period is monthly data transfer. A similar situation can occur for end user ISPs as well, especially where network capacity is limited .  Internet connections This table shows the maximum bandwidth of common Internet access technologies. For more detailed lists see List of interface bit rates Bit rate Progress trends Bit rate Multimedia  Edholm's law  Edholm's law, proposed by and named after Phil Edholm in 2004, holds that the bandwidth of telecommunication networks double every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s. The trend is evident in the cases of Internet, cellular , wireless LAN and wireless personal area networks.The MOSFET is the most important factor enabling the rapid increase in bandwidth. The MOSFET was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and went on to become the basic building block of modern telecommunications technology. Continuous MOSFET scaling, along with various advances in MOS technology, has enabled both Moore's law and Edholm's law .  References",

            "text": "Barnes Noble Booksellers is an American bookseller. It is a Fortune 1000 company and the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States. As of July 7, 2020, the company operates 614 retail stores across all 50 U.S. states.Barnes Noble operates mainly through its Barnes Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 33 E. 17th Street on Union Square in New York City.After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes Noble stands alone as the United States' largest national bookstore chain. Previously, Barnes Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Bookseller stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company was also one of the nation's largest manager of college textbook stores located on or near many college campuses when that division was spun off as a separate public company called Barnes Noble Education in 2015. During the COVID 19 pandemic, Barnes Noble saw up to a 500 increase in graphic novel and manga sales.The company is known by its customers for large retail outlets, many of which contain a caf serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e readers and tablets. The company offers publishing and self publishing services.  History   19th century: Foundations  Barnes Noble began in 1886 as a bookstore called Arthur Hinds Company, located at 4 Cooper Institute in the Cooper Union Building in New York City. In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds Noble.  20th century: Expansion   1900 1919  In 1901, Hinds Noble moved to 31 35 W. 15th Street.In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles Barnes; the name of the store was changed to Barnes Noble soon after. Charles had previously opened a book printing business in Wheaton, Illinois, in 1873, named the C. M. Barnes Wilcox Company; William Barnes, however, divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's business shortly before his partnership with Noble. Although the flagship store once featured the motto Founded in 1873, the C. M. Barnes Wilcox Company never had any connection with Barnes Noble, save for the fact that both were partly owned by William Barnes.  1920 1939  In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son, John Wilcox Barnes. Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72. In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved its flagship location to 18th Street and Fifth Avenue, which served as the company's flagship location until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.  1940 1959  In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak, and it underwent a major renovation the following year. That decade, the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago. William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control. The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.  1960 1979  John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later. The business was then purchased in 1971 by Leonard Riggio, who has been credited as one of the founders, for 1.2 million. By then, it had been mismanaged and consisted only of a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location the flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue. The publishing operation was sold separately by Amtel to Harper Row. In 1974, Barnes Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in the United States to discount books, by selling The New York Times best selling titles at 40 off the publishers' list price. Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes Noble opened smaller discount stores, which were eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out of print titles and selling them through mail order catalogs allowed Barnes Noble to reach new customers nationwide.In November 1974, editors of the British produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television program Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.  1980 1999  Barnes Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated 275 million to 300 million. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase gave Barnes Noble the necessary know how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore. The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second largest online bookseller in the United States. B N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers. The last B. Dalton stores ceased operations in January 2010.In 1989, Barnes Noble purchased the 22 store chain Bookstop. In September 1993, Barnes Noble became a publicly traded company by issuing 77 million worth of stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the BKS ticker symbol. The company remained on the stock exchange until August 2019 when Elliot Management purchased all of the company's stock and took the company private. Before Barnes Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called Trintex , a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997. BarnesandNoble.com went public in 1999.  21st century: Operating in an electronic environment   2000s  In 2004, it was reported that the reading of books was on the decline in America, with the number of non reading adults increasing by 17 million between 1992 and 2002. Despite this, Barnes Noble claimed that its retail store business was expanding in the book market. Beginning in 1999, Barnes Noble owned GameStop, a video game and electronics retail outlet. The company distributed its shares in GameStop in late 2004, spinning it off into its own company in an attempt to simplify its corporate structure.CEO Leonard Riggio stepped down in 2002, naming his younger brother and former acting chief executive of BarnesandNoble.com, Stephen Riggio, to succeed him. Some corporate governance experts noted that this appointment could potentially cause conflict of interest, but the company board noted that Riggio's experience at the company made him the right person for the job. Stephen Riggio stepped down from the position in 2010.  2010s  In 2010, website president William Lynch was named CEO. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman. When Lynch resigned in mid 2013, he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year. Following the spinoff of Barnes Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid 2015 by Ronald Boire, who departed one year later. Demos Parneros was named Barnes Noble's Chief Executive Officer in April 2017 after having joined the company as Chief Operating Officer in November 2016; however, he was fired in July 2018 for company policy violations without severance and was immediately removed from the company's board, at the advice of a law firm hired by Barnes Noble. On August 28, 2018, Parneros filed a lawsuit against Barnes Noble, claiming wrongful termination.After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011, Barnes Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in the United States. This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books A Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers. Amazon has even opened its own physical bookstores, once again creating a second national bookstore chain.Barnes Noble began reducing its overall presence in the 2010s, closing its original flagship store in early 2014. In mid 2014, the company announced it would separate its Nook Media division from its retail store division.In February 2018, Barnes Noble permanently laid off 1,800 full time employees at an annual cost savings of 40 million per year. According to TechCrunch, the company essentially fired their entire full time staff at all their stores, who would be making an average of 22,000 per year , and were replaced by part time workers earning close to minimum wage.In the 2018 fiscal year that ended in July, the company overall losses reached 17 million.In early July 2018, Barnes Noble fired CEO Demos Parneros for an unspecified violation of company policy, which was later revealed to be over sexual harassment claims. It accused Pareneros of breaching his duties of loyalty and good faith and acting as a faithless servant by sexually harassing the female employee, bullying subordinates, and attempting to sabotage a potential acquisition of the New York based company, and asserted that the company should therefore be entitled to claw back his salary, bonus, and other benefits during the period of his disloyal conduct .On October 3, 2018, the board of directors announced that they would entertain offers to buy the company. Among the potential buyers was Leonard Riggio, who owned at the time approximately 19 of Barnes Noble stock. As a result of the news, the company's stock price jumped by nearly 30 .In August 2019, Elliott Management Corporation acquired the company for approximately 683m with James Daunt, the managing director of London based Waterstones Booksellers Ltd., becoming CEO. James Daunt will be CEO of both Waterstones and Barnes Noble and will relocate from London to New York. On August 7, 2019, Barnes Noble became a privately held, wholly owned subsidiary of Elliott.  2020s  In March 2020, Barnes Noble announced that they would temporarily stop selling magazines and, likewise temporarily, close 400 of their 620 stores due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Around 12 B N shops were closed for good since Elliott Advisors' acquisition of the company, and Daunt plans to change the acquisition process, with initial frontlist orders being made centrally and in smaller numbers than in previous years. In April, 2022, The New York Times reported the company used the temporary closure of stores during the pandemic to refurbish them, and credited Mr. Daunt with turning around sales both in store and online. In September 2022, this store will replace two former Boston area Amazon Books stores that were closed in March of this year, that will take place in Legacy Place in Dedham and MarketStreet in Lynnfield locations in Boston.  Publishing Barnes Noble maintains a separate publishing business in addition to its retail stores and other entities. Barnes Noble's publishing company got its start by reissuing inexpensive versions of out of print books, and made a push to expand the unit in 2003. The company saw success the following year; in September 2004, its book, Hippie, reached The New York Times Best Seller list.Barnes Noble often publishes and sells books at a lower cost than competitors, and sells lines of inexpensive books like Barnes Noble Classics and the leather bound Barnes Noble Collectible Classics collection which has it has published since 1992. In addition, the company has a second paperback series called the Barnes Noble Library of Essential Reading. Barnes Noble's edition of The Gentle Art of Verbal Self Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies, and its reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, has sold over 1 million copies.The company has expanded business by acquiring several firms over the years, including J.B. Fairfax International in 1999, SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company, in 2001 and Sterling Publishing in 2003.  Food service  In 1993, Barnes Noble signed an agreement to serve Starbucks coffee in each of its existing and future cafes. In 2004, Barnes Noble began offering Wi Fi in the caf area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink . All stores offered Wi Fi as of 2006 and as of July 27, 2009, Wi Fi is offered for free to all customers. In 2016, Barnes Noble announced plans to open four concept stores in 2017 that featured caf s twice the size of its usual food spots, as well as bars offering wine and beer. Restaurants would also include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The restaurants were expected to revive sales growth. Company executives planned to open additional concept stores if sales met expectations. The first stores were opened in Scarsdale, New York; Edina, Minnesota; Plano, Texas; and Folsom, California.  Community involvement Barnes Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. Barnes Noble also gives back to the community to increase literacy and education. The Barnes Noble located in Fairbanks, Alaska gave over 80,000 to the community between 2015 and 2018 through book fair fundraising programs. To promote nationwide literacy among 1st through 6th graders and encourage more reading and learning during the summer, Barnes Noble has implemented a summer challenge.  The Barnes Noble Review The Barnes Noble Review is an online magazine, hosted on Barnes Noble's website, that publishes evaluations of both fiction and nonfiction works, along with essays, interviews, and pieces on other topics. It was launched in October 2007 by Barnes Noble CEO Steve Riggio and James Mustich Jr., publisher of the book catalog A Common Reader. Regular contributors to the magazine have included book critics Michael Dirda, Brooke Allen, Laura Miller, and Adam Kirsch, as well as prominent writers in fields outside of literary criticism, such as political journalists Chris Hayes and Ezra Klein, philosopher A. C. Grayling, music critic Robert Christgau, and cartoonist Ward Sutton. Miller, who has written for Salon and Mustich's Common Reader, said, The reviews at BNR are the same as anywhere else , adding that the tone and length of the pieces evoke The New York Times Book Review rather than the less formal Salon. The magazine's web traffic flourished during its first few years. According to Compete.com, it amassed 50,000 unique visitors in December 2009.Some critics were originally skeptical of The Barnes Noble Review. Art Winslow, former literary editor of The Nation, said that because Barnes Noble is a brand name, BNR's contributors are effectively endorsing the corporation, and that the motives behind the publication undermine its integrity: Criticism's content should be free of any commercialism. Barnes Noble has found another way to sell books, and that's the Review. ... I wouldn't write there. Mustich disputed the idea that the magazine serves as a corporate tactic: We counter that skepticism with quality. If people read the site, they can determine that we are doing what we purport to do. They have never tried to influence my judgment. The first attempt would have been the last.  Barnes Noble Nook  Barnes Noble Nook is a suite of e book readers developed by the company, based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009, and was released November 30, 2009, for 259. On June 21, 2010, Barnes Noble reduced the Nook's price to 199, as well as launched a new Wi Fi only model, for 149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for 249.The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e reader offerings and color tablets with reading apps, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6 inch, 7 inch, or larger touchscreen. Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future. The color version of the Nook introduced a 7 inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested 300 million for a 17.6 stake in Nook, which valued the business at about 1.7 billion.In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.In June 2014, Barnes Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company, but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business. Samsung and Barnes Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake. Samsung and Barnes Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.In March 2016, Barnes Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15. It continues to sell e books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US. In 2021, the company announced the release of a new 10 inch Android based tablet, which is named the Nook 10 HD, in a partnership with Lenovo, which is manufacturing the device.  College bookstores spin off  Barnes Noble formerly had a subsidiary, Barnes Noble College Booksellers, that specialized in operating campus bookstores at colleges and university. In 2015, the college operations were spun off into a new separate company, Barnes Noble Education.

            "text": "The Boeing B 17 Flying Fortress is a four engined heavy bomber developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Air Corps . Competing against Douglas and Martin for a contract to build 200 bombers, the Boeing entry outperformed both competitors and exceeded the Air Corps' performance specifications. Although Boeing lost the contract because the prototype crashed, the Air Corps ordered 13 more B 17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B 17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous design advances, becoming the third most produced bomber of all time, behind the four engined Consolidated B 24 Liberator and the multirole, twin engined Junkers Ju 88. The B 17 was primarily employed by the USAAF in the daylight strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial, military and civilian targets. The United States Eighth Air Force, based at many airfields in central, eastern and southern England, and the Fifteenth Air Force, based in Italy, complemented the RAF Bomber Command's night time area bombing in the Combined Bomber Offensive to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for the invasion of France in 1944. The B 17 also participated to a lesser extent in the Pacific War, early in World War II, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.From its prewar inception, the USAAC promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a relatively fast, high flying, long range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload. It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B 17s safely returning to base. The B 17 dropped more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II. Of approximately 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped on Nazi Germany and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, over 640 000 tons were dropped from B 17s. In addition to its role as a bomber, the B 17 was also employed as a transport, antisubmarine aircraft, drone controller, and search and rescue aircraft. As of October 2019, nine aircraft remain airworthy, though none of them were ever flown in combat. Dozens more are in storage or on static display. The oldest of these is a D series flown in combat in the Pacific on the first day of the United States' involvement in World War II.  Development   Origins  On 8 August 1934, the USAAC tendered a proposal for a multiengine bomber to replace the Martin B 10. The Air Corps was looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska. Requirements were for it to carry a useful bombload at an altitude of 10,000 ft for 10 hours with a top speed of at least 200 mph .They also desired, but did not require, a range of 2,000 mi and a speed of 250 mph . The competition for the air corps contract was to be decided by a fly off between Boeing's design, the Douglas DB 1, and the Martin Model 146 at Wilbur Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. The prototype B 17, with the Boeing factory designation of Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells, and was built at Boeing's own expense. It combined features of the company's experimental XB 15 bomber and 247 transport. The B 17's armament consisted of five .30 caliber machine guns, with a payload up to 4,800 lb of bombs on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit. The aircraft was powered by four Pratt Whitney R 1690 Hornet radial engines, each producing 750 hp at 7,000 ft .The first flight of the Model 299 was on 28 July 1935 with Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower at the controls. The day before, Richard Williams, a reporter for The Seattle Times, coined the name Flying Fortress when observing the large number of machine guns sticking out from the new airplane he described it as a 15 ton flying fortress in a picture caption. The most distinct mount was in the nose, which allowed the single machine gun to be fired toward nearly all frontal angles.Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. Boeing also claimed in some of the early press releases that Model 299 was the first combat aircraft that could continue its mission if one of its four engines failed. On 20 August 1935, the prototype flew from Seattle to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes with an average cruising speed of 252 miles per hour , much faster than the competition.At the fly off, the four engined Boeing's performance was superior to those of the twin engined DB 1 and Model 146. Major General Frank Maxwell Andrews of the GHQ Air Force believed that the capabilities of large four engined aircraft exceeded those of shorter ranged, twin engined aircraft, and that the B 17 was better suited to new, emerging USAAC doctrine. His opinions were shared by the air corps procurement officers, and even before the competition had finished, they suggested buying 65 B 17s.On 30 October 1935, a test flight determining the rate of climb and service ceiling was planned. The command pilot was Major Ployer Peter Hill, Wright Field Material Division Chief of the Flying Branch, his first flight in the Model 299. Copilot was Lieutenant Donald Putt, while Boeing chief test pilot Leslie R. Tower was behind the pilots in an advisory role. Also on board were Wright Field test observer John Cutting, and mechanic Mark Koegler. Tragically, the plane stalled, spun into the ground, bursting into flames, soon after takeoff. Though initially surviving the impact, Hill died within a few hours, and Tower on 19 November. Post accident interviews with Tower and Putt determined the control surface gust lock had not been released. Doyle notes, The loss of Hill and Tower, and the Model 299, was directly responsible for the creation of the modern written checklist used by pilots to this day. The crashed Model 299 could not finish the evaluation, disqualifying it from the competition. While the air corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential, army officials were daunted by its cost; Douglas quoted a unit price of 58,200 based on a production order of 220 aircraft, compared with 99,620 from Boeing. Army Chief of Staff Malin Craig cancelled the order for 65 YB 17s, and ordered 133 of the twin engined Douglas B 18 Bolo, instead. The loss was not total... but Boeing's hopes for a substantial bomber contract were dashed.  Initial orders  Regardless, the USAAC had been impressed by the prototype's performance, and on 17 January 1936, through a legal loophole, the Air Corps ordered 13 YB 17s for service testing. The YB 17 incorporated a number of significant changes from the Model 299, including more powerful Wright R 1820 39 Cyclone engines. Although the prototype was company owned and never received a military serial , the term XB 17 was retroactively applied to the NX13372's airframe and has entered the lexicon to describe the first Flying Fortress. Between 1 March and 4 August 1937, 12 of the 13 Y1B 17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field in Virginia for operational development and flight tests. One suggestion adopted was the use of a preflight checklist to avoid accidents such as that which befell the Model 299. In one of their first missions, three B 17s, directed by lead navigator Lieutenant Curtis LeMay, were sent by General Andrews to intercept and photograph the Italian ocean liner Rex 610 miles off the Atlantic coast. The mission was successful and widely publicized. The 13th Y1B 17 was delivered to the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio, to be used for flight testing.A 14th Y1B 17 , originally constructed for ground testing of the airframe's strength, was upgraded by Boeing with exhaust driven General Electric turbo superchargers, and designated Y1B 17A. Designed by Dr. Sanford Moss, engine exhaust gases turned the turbine's steel alloy blades, forcing high pressure ram air into the Wright Cyclone GR 1820 39 engine supercharger. Scheduled to fly in 1937, it encountered problems with the turbochargers, and its first flight was delayed until 29 April 1938. The aircraft was delivered to the army on 31 January 1939. Once service testing was complete, the Y1B 17s and Y1B 17A were redesignated B 17 and B 17A, respectively, to signify the change to operational status. The Y1B 17A had a maximum speed of 311 miles per hour , at its best operational altitude, compared to 239 miles per hour for the Y1B 17. Also, the Y1B 17A's new service ceiling was more than 2 miles higher at 38,000 feet , compared to the Y1B 17's 27,800 feet . These turbo superchargers were incorporated into the B 17B.Opposition to the air corps' ambitions for the acquisition of more B 17s faded, and in late 1937, 10 more aircraft designated B 17B were ordered to equip two bombardment groups, one on each U.S. coast. Improved with larger flaps and rudder and a well framed, 10 panel plexiglas nose, the B 17Bs were delivered in five small batches between July 1939 and March 1940. In July 1940, an order for 512 B 17s was issued, but at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, fewer than 200 were in service with the army.A total of 155 B 17s of all variants were delivered between 11 January 1937 and 30 November 1941, but production quickly accelerated, with the B 17 once holding the record for the highest production rate for any large aircraft. The aircraft went on to serve in every World War II combat zone, and by the time production ended in May 1945, 12,731 aircraft had been built by Boeing, Douglas, and Vega . Though the crash of the prototype 299 in 1935 had almost wiped out Boeing, now it was seen as a boon. Instead of building models based on experimental engineering, Boeing had been hard at work developing their bomber and now had versions ready for production far better than would have been possible otherwise. One of the most significant weapons of World War II would be ready, but only by a hair.  Design and variants  The aircraft went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 YB 17s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia, to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio. Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a quartet of General Electric turbo superchargers, which later became standard on the B 17 line. A 14th aircraft, the YB 17A, originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbochargers, was redesignated B 17A after testing had finished.As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the B 17B was altered to include larger rudders and flaps. The B 17C changed from three bulged, oval shaped gun blisters to two flush, oval shaped gun window openings, and on the lower fuselage, a single bathtub gun gondola housing, which resembled the similarly configured and located Bodenlafette Bola ventral defensive emplacement on the German Heinkel He 111P series medium bomber. While models A through D of the B 17 were designed defensively, the large tailed B 17E was the first model primarily focused on offensive warfare. The B 17E was an extensive revision of the Model 299 design: The fuselage was extended by 10 ft ; a much larger rear fuselage, vertical tailfin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer were added; a gunner's position was added in the new tail; the nose remained relatively the same as the earlier B through D versions had; a Sperry electrically powered manned dorsal gun turret just behind the cockpit was added; a similarly powered manned ventral ball turret just aft of the bomb bay replaced the relatively hard to use, Sperry model 645705 D remotely operated ventral turret on the earliest examples of the E variant. These modifications resulted in a 20 increase in aircraft weight. The B 17's turbocharged Wright R 1820 Cyclone 9 engines were upgraded to increasingly more powerful versions of the same powerplants throughout its production, and similarly, the number of machine gun emplacement locations was increased. The B 17F variants were the primary versions flying for the Eighth Air Force to face the Germans in 1943, and had standardized the manned Sperry ball turret for ventral defense, also replacing the earlier, 10 panel framed bombardier's nose glazing from the B subtype with an enlarged, nearly frameless Plexiglas bombardier's nose enclosure for improved forward vision. Two experimental versions of the B 17 were flown under different designations, the XB 38 Flying Fortress and the YB 40 Flying Fortress. The XB 38 was an engine testbed for Allison V 1710 liquid cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B 17 become unavailable. The only prototype XB 38 to fly crashed on its ninth flight, and the type was abandoned. The Allison V 1710 was allocated to fighter aircraft.The YB 40 was a heavily armed modification of the standard B 17 used before the North American P 51 Mustang, an effective long range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included an additional dorsal turret in the radio room, a remotely operated and fired Bendix built chin turret directly below the bombardier's accommodation, and twin .50 in guns in each of the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds. All of these modifications made the YB 40 well over 10,000 lb heavier than a fully loaded B 17F. The YB 40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with the lighter bombers once they had dropped their bombs, so the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943. The final production blocks of the B 17F from Douglas' plants did, however, adopt the YB 40's chin turret , giving them a much improved forward defense capability. By the time the definitive B 17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to 13, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were completed. The B 17G was the final version of the Flying Fortress, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B 17F, and in total, 8,680 were built, the last on 28 July 1945. Many B 17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing, and reconnaissance. Initially designated SB 17G, a number of B 17Gs were also converted for search and rescue duties, later to be redesignated B 17H. Late in World War II, at least 25 B 17s were fitted with radio controls and television cameras, loaded with 20,000 lb of high explosives and dubbed BQ 7 Aphrodite missiles for Operation Aphrodite. The operation, which involved remotely flying Aphrodite drones onto their targets by accompanying CQ 17 mothership control aircraft, was approved on 26 June 1944, and assigned to the 388th Bombardment Group stationed at RAF Fersfield, a satellite of RAF Knettishall.The first four drones were sent to Mimoyecques, the Siracourt V 1 bunker, Watten, and Wizernes on 4 August, causing little damage. The project came to a sudden end with the unexplained midair explosion over the Blyth estuary of a B 24, part of the United States Navy's contribution as Project Anvil , en route for Heligoland piloted by Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., future U.S. president John F. Kennedy's elder brother. Blast damage was caused over a radius of 5 miles . British authorities were anxious that no similar accidents should again occur, and the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.  Operational history  The B 17 began operations in World War II with the Royal Air Force in 1941, and in the Southwest Pacific with the U.S. Army. The 19th Bombardment Group had deployed to Clark Field in the Philippines a few weeks before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as the first of a planned heavy bomber buildup in the Pacific. Half of the group's B 17s were wiped out on 8 December 1941 when they were caught on the ground during refueling and rearming for a planned attack on Japanese airfields on Formosa. The small force of B 17s operated against the Japanese invasion force until they were withdrawn to Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory. In early 1942, the 7th Bombardment Group began arriving in Java with a mixed force of B 17s and LB 30 B 24s. A squadron of B 17s from this force detached to the Middle East to join the First Provisional Bombardment Group, thus becoming the first American B 17 squadron to go to war against the Germans. After the defeat in Java, the 19th withdrew to Australia, where it continued in combat until it was sent home by General George C. Kenney when he arrived in Australia in mid 1942. In July 1942, the first USAAF B 17s were sent to England to join the Eighth Air Force. Later that year, two groups moved to Algeria to join Twelfth Air Force for operations in North Africa. The B 17s were primarily involved in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign against German targets ranging from U boat pens, docks, warehouses, and airfields to industrial targets such as aircraft factories. In the campaign against German aircraft forces in preparation for the invasion of France, B 17 and B 24 raids were directed against German aircraft production while their presence drew the Luftwaffe fighters into battle with Allied fighters.During World War II, the B 17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF aircraft worldwide. The British heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, dropped 608,612 long tons and 224,207 long tons respectively.  RAF use  The RAF entered World War II with no heavy bomber of its own in service; the biggest available were long range medium bombers such as the Vickers Wellington, which could carry up to 4,500 pounds of bombs. While the Short Stirling and Handley Page Halifax became its primary bombers by 1941, in early 1940, the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to acquire 20 B 17Cs, which were given the service name Fortress I. Their first operation, against Wilhelmshaven on 8 July 1941 was unsuccessful. On 24 July three B 17s of 90 Squadron took part in a raid on the German capital ship Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen anchored in Brest from 30,000 ft , with the objective of drawing German fighters away from 18 Handley Page Hampdens attacking at lower altitudes, and in time for 79 Vickers Wellingtons to attack later with the German fighters refuelling. The operation did not work as expected, with 90 Squadron's Fortresses being unopposed.By September, the RAF had lost eight B 17Cs in combat and had experienced numerous mechanical problems, and Bomber Command abandoned daylight bombing raids using the Fortress I because of the aircraft's poor performance. The experience showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B 17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bomb loads and more accurate bombing methods were required. However, the USAAF continued using the B 17 as a day bomber, despite misgivings by the RAF that attempts at daylight bombing would be ineffective.As use by Bomber Command had been curtailed, the RAF transferred its remaining Fortress I aircraft to Coastal Command for use as a long range maritime patrol aircraft, instead. These were augmented starting in July 1942 by 45 Fortress Mk IIA followed by 19 Fortress Mk II and three Fortress Mk III . A Fortress IIA from No. 206 Squadron RAF sank U 627 on 27 October 1942, the first of 11 U boat kills credited to RAF Fortress bombers during the war.As sufficient Consolidated Liberators finally became available, Coastal Command withdrew the Fortress from the Azores, transferring the type to the meteorological reconnaissance role. Three squadrons undertook Met profiles from airfields in Iceland, Scotland and England, gathering data for vital weather forecasting purposes. The RAF's No. 223 Squadron, as part of 100 Group, operated a number of Fortresses equipped with an electronic warfare system known as Airborne Cigar . This was operated by German speaking radio operators who were to identify and jam German ground controllers' broadcasts to their nightfighters. They could also pose as ground controllers themselves with the intention of steering nightfighters away from the bomber streams.  Initial USAAF operations over Europe  The air corps renamed United States Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941 used the B 17 and other bombers to bomb from high altitudes with the aid of the then secret Norden bombsight, known as the Blue Ox , which was an optical electromechanical gyrostabilized analog computer. The device was able to determine, from variables put in by the bombardier, the point at which the aircraft's bombs should be released to hit the target. The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level altitude during the final moments before release.The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B 17Es soon after entering the war. The first Eighth Air Force units arrived in High Wycombe, England, on 12 May 1942, to form the 97th Bomb Group. On 17 August 1942, 12 B 17Es of the 97th, with the lead aircraft piloted by Major Paul Tibbets and carrying Brigadier General Ira Eaker as an observer, were close escorted by four squadrons of RAF Spitfire IXs on the first USAAF heavy bomber raid over Europe, against the large railroad marshalling yards at Rouen Sotteville in France, while a further six aircraft flew a diversionary raid along the French coast. The operation, carried out in good visibility, was a success, with only minor damage to one aircraft, unrelated to enemy action, and half the bombs landing in the target area. The raid helped allay British doubts about the capabilities of American heavy bombers in operations over Europe.Two additional groups arrived in Britain at the same time, bringing with them the first B 17Fs, which served as the primary AAF heavy bomber fighting the Germans until September 1943. As the raids of the American bombing campaign grew in numbers and frequency, German interception efforts grew in strength , such that unescorted bombing missions came to be discouraged.  Combined offensive  The two different strategies of the American and British bomber commands were organized at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943. The resulting Combined Bomber Offensive weakened the Wehrmacht, destroyed German morale, and established air superiority through Operation Pointblank's destruction of German fighter strength in preparation for a ground offensive. The USAAF bombers attacked by day, with British operations chiefly against industrial cities by night. Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General Ira C. Eaker and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories, and ball bearing manufacturers. Attacks began in April 1943 on heavily fortified key industrial plants in Bremen and Recklinghausen.Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, additional B 17 groups were formed, and Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball bearing factories in Schweinfurt, hoping to cripple the war effort there. The first raid on 17 August 1943 did not result in critical damage to the factories, with the 230 attacking B 17s being intercepted by an estimated 300 Luftwaffe fighters. The Germans shot down 36 aircraft with the loss of 200 men, and coupled with a raid earlier in the day against Regensburg, a total of 60 B 17s were lost that day.A second attempt on Schweinfurt on 14 October 1943 later came to be known as Black Thursday . While the attack was successful at disrupting the entire works, severely curtailing work there for the remainder of the war, it was at an extreme cost. Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 60 were shot down over Germany, five crashed on approach to Britain, and 12 more were scrapped due to damage a loss of 77 B 17s. Additionally, 122 bombers were damaged and needed repairs before their next flights. Of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 did not return, although some survived as prisoners of war. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses were a result of concentrated attacks by over 300 German fighters. Such high losses of aircrews could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers to interceptors when operating alone, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back. At the same time, the German nightfighting ability noticeably improved to counter the nighttime strikes, challenging the conventional faith in the cover of darkness. The 8th Air Force alone lost 176 bombers in October 1943, and was to suffer similar casualties on 11 January 1944 on missions to Oschersleben, Halberstadt, and Brunswick. Lieutenant General James Doolittle, commander of the 8th, had ordered the second Schweinfurt mission to be cancelled as the weather deteriorated, but the lead units had already entered hostile air space and continued with the mission. Most of the escorts turned back or missed the rendezvous, and as a result, 60 B 17s were destroyed.A third raid on Schweinfurt on 24 February 1944 highlighted what came to be known as Big Week , during which the bombing missions were directed against German aircraft production. German fighters needed to respond, and the North American P 51 Mustang and Republic P 47 Thunderbolt fighters accompanying the American heavies all the way to and from the targets engaged them. The escort fighters reduced the loss rate to below 7 , with a total of 247 B 17s lost in 3,500 sorties while taking part in the Big Week raids.By September 1944, 27 of the 42 bomb groups of the 8th Air Force and six of the 21 groups of the 15th Air Force used B 17s. Losses to flak continued to take a high toll of heavy bombers through 1944, but the war in Europe was being won by the Allies. And by 27 April 1945, 2 days after the last heavy bombing mission in Europe, the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of bombers per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.  Pacific Theater  On 7 December 1941, a group of 12 B 17s of the 38th and 88th Reconnaissance Squadrons, en route to reinforce the Philippines, was flown into Pearl Harbor from Hamilton Field, California, arriving while the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was going on. Leonard Smitty Smith Humiston, co pilot on First Lieutenant Robert H. Richards' B 17C, AAF S N 40 2049, reported that he thought the U.S. Navy was giving the flight a 21 gun salute to celebrate the arrival of the bombers, after which he realized that Pearl Harbor was under attack. The Fortress came under fire from Japanese fighter aircraft, though the crew was unharmed with the exception of one member who suffered an abrasion on his hand. Japanese activity forced them to divert from Hickam Field to Bellows Field. On landing, the aircraft overran the runway and ran into a ditch, where it was then strafed. Although initially deemed repairable, 40 2049 received more than 200 bullet holes and never flew again. Ten of the 12 Fortresses survived the attack. By 1941, the Far East Air Force based at Clark Field in the Philippines had 35 B 17s, with the War Department eventually planning to raise that to 165. When the FEAF received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor, General Lewis H. Brereton sent his bombers and fighters on various patrol missions to prevent them from being caught on the ground. Brereton planned B 17 raids on Japanese air fields in Formosa, in accordance with Rainbow 5 war plan directives, but this was overruled by General Douglas MacArthur. A series of disputed discussions and decisions, followed by several confusing and false reports of air attacks, delayed the authorization of the sortie. By the time the B 17s and escorting Curtiss P 40 Warhawk fighters were about to get airborne, they were destroyed by Japanese bombers of the 11th Air Fleet. The FEAF lost half its aircraft during the first strike, and was all but destroyed over the next few days.Another early World War II Pacific engagement, on 10 December 1941, involved Colin Kelly, who reportedly crashed his B 17 into the Japanese battleship Haruna, which was later acknowledged as a near bomb miss on the heavy cruiser Ashigara. Nonetheless, this deed made him a celebrated war hero. Kelly's B 17C AAF S N 40 2045 crashed about 6 mi from Clark Field after he held the burning Fortress steady long enough for the surviving crew to bail out. Kelly was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Noted Japanese ace Sabur Sakai is credited with this kill, and in the process, came to respect the ability of the Fortress to absorb punishment.B 17s were used in early battles of the Pacific with little success, notably the Battle of Coral Sea and Battle of Midway. While there, the Fifth Air Force B 17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lanes. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but they soon found only 1 of their bombs hit targets. However, B 17s were operating at heights too great for most A6M Zero fighters to reach. The B 17's greatest success in the Pacific was in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, in which aircraft of this type were responsible for damaging and sinking several Japanese transport ships. On 2 March 1943, six B 17s of the 64th Squadron flying at 10,000 ft attacked a major Japanese troop convoy off New Guinea, using skip bombing to sink Kyokusei Maru, which carried 1,200 army troops, and damage two other transports, Teiyo Maru and Nojima. On 3 March 1943, 13 B 17s flying at 7,000 ft bombed the convoy, forcing the convoy to disperse and reducing the concentration of their anti aircraft defenses. The B 17s attracted a number of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, which were in turn attacked by the P 38 Lightning escorts. One B 17 broke up in the air, and its crew was forced to take to their parachutes. Japanese fighter pilots machine gunned some of the B 17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed. Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B 17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three Lightnings, though these were also then lost. The allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed, while the B 17 crews claimed five more. Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged. The remaining seven transports and three of the eight destroyers were then sunk by a combination of low level strafing runs by Royal Australian Air Force Beaufighters, and skip bombing by USAAF North American B 25 Mitchells at 100 ft , while B 17s claimed five hits from higher altitudes. On the morning of 4 March 1943, a B 17 sank the destroyer Asashio with a 500 lb bomb while she was picking up survivors from Arashio.At their peak, 168 B 17 bombers were in the Pacific theater in September 1942, but already in mid 1942 Gen. Arnold had decided that the B 17 was unsuitable for the kind of operations required in the Pacific and made plans to replace all of the B 17s in the theater with B 24s as soon as they became available. Although the conversion was not complete until mid 1943, B 17 combat operations in the Pacific theater came to an end after a little over a year. Surviving aircraft were reassigned to the 54th Troop Carrier Wing's special airdrop section, and were used to drop supplies to ground forces operating in close contact with the enemy. Special airdrop B 17s supported Australian commandos operating near the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, which had been the primary B 17 target in 1942 and early 1943.B 17s were still used in the Pacific later in the war, however, mainly in the combat search and rescue role. A number of B 17Gs, redesignated B 17Hs and later SB 17Gs, were used in the Pacific during the final year of the war to carry and drop lifeboats to stranded bomber crews who had been shot down or crashed at sea. These aircraft were nicknamed Dumbos, and remained in service for many years after the end of World War II.  Bomber defense  Before the advent of long range fighter escorts, B 17s had only their .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor. Defensive armament increased from four 0.50 in machine guns and one 0.30 in nose machine gun in the B 17C, to thirteen 0.50 in machine guns in the B 17G. But because the bombers could not maneuver when attacked by fighters, and needed to be flown straight and level during their final bomb run, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack. A 1943 survey by the USAAF found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans had left the protection of the main formation. To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb group formation, which evolved into the staggered combat box formation in which all the B 17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns. This made a formation of bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters. In order to more quickly form these formations, assembly ships, planes with distinctive paint schemes, were utilized to guide bombers into formation, saving assembly time. Luftwaffe fighter pilots likened attacking a B 17 combat box formation to encountering a fliegendes Stachelschwein, flying porcupine , with dozens of machine guns in a combat box aimed at them from almost every direction. However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual aircraft could not engage in evasive maneuvers: they had to fly constantly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to German flak. Moreover, German fighter aircraft later developed the tactic of high speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict damage with minimum risk. As a result, the B 17s' loss rate was up to 25 on some early missions. It was not until the advent of long range fighter escorts and the resulting degradation of the Luftwaffe as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944, that the B 17 became strategically potent. The B 17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B 17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War II, said, The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home. Martin Caidin reported one instance in which a B 17 suffered a midair collision with a Focke Wulf Fw 190, losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, and being knocked out of formation by the impact. The B 17 was reported as shot down by observers, but it survived and brought its crew home without injury. Its toughness was compensation for its shorter range and lighter bomb load compared to the B 24 and British Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Stories circulated of B 17s returning to base with tails shredded, engines destroyed and large portions of their wings destroyed by flak. This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the Eighth Air Force and the fame achieved by the Memphis Belle, made the B 17 a key bomber aircraft of the war. Other factors such as combat effectiveness and political issues also contributed to the B 17's success.  Luftwaffe attacks  After examining wrecked B 17s and B 24s, Luftwaffe officers discovered that on average it took about 20 hits with 20 mm shells fired from the rear to bring them down. Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to fire one thousand 20 mm rounds at a bomber. Early versions of the Fw 190, one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two 20 mm MG FF cannons, which carried only 500 rounds when belt fed , and later with the better Mauser MG 151 20 cannons, which had a longer effective range than the MG FF weapon. Later versions carried four or even six MG 151 20 cannon and twin 13 mm machine guns. The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were mounted , it took only four or five hits to bring a bomber down.To rectify the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four, with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, creating the Sturmbock bomber destroyer version. This type replaced the vulnerable twin engine Zerst rer heavy fighters which could not survive interception by P 51 Mustangs flying well ahead of the combat boxes in an air supremacy role starting very early in 1944 to clear any Luftwaffe defensive fighters from the skies. By 1944, a further upgrade to Rheinmetall Borsig's 30 mm MK 108 cannons mounted either in the wing, or in underwing, conformal mount gun pods, was made for the Sturmbock Focke Wulfs as either the R2 or R8 field modification kits, enabling aircraft to bring a bomber down with just a few hits. The adoption of the 21 cm Nebelwerfer derived Werfer Granate 21 rocket mortar by the Luftwaffe in mid August 1943 promised the introduction of a major stand off style of offensive weapon one strut mounted tubular launcher was fixed under each wing panel on the Luftwaffe's single engine fighters, and two under each wing panel of a few twin engine Bf 110 daylight Zerst rer aircraft. However, due to the slow 715 mph velocity and characteristic ballistic drop of the fired rocket , and the small number of fighters fitted with the weapons, the Wfr. Gr. 21 never had a major effect on the combat box formations of Fortresses. The Luftwaffe also fitted heavy caliber Bordkanone series 37, 50 and even 75 mm cannon as anti bomber weapons on twin engine aircraft such as the special Ju 88P fighters, as well as one model of the Me 410 Hornisse but these measures did not have much effect on the American strategic bomber offensive. The Me 262, however, had moderate success against the B 17 late in the war. With its usual nose mounted armament of four MK 108 cannons, and with some examples later equipped with the R4M rocket, launched from underwing racks, it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' .50 in defensive guns and bring an aircraft down with one hit, as both the MK 108's shells and the R4M's warheads were filled with the shattering force of the strongly brisant Hexogen military explosive.  Luftwaffe captured B 17s  During World War II approximately 40 B 17s were captured and refurbished by Germany after crash landing or being forced down, with about a dozen put back into the air. Given German Balkenkreuz national markings on their wings and fuselage sides, and Hakenkreuz swastika tail fin flashes, the captured B 17s were used to determine the B 17's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in attack tactics. Others, with the cover designations Dornier Do 200 and Do 288, were used as long range transports by the Kampfgeschwader 200 special duties unit, carrying out agent drops and supplying secret airstrips in the Middle East and North Africa. They were chosen specifically for these missions as being more suitable for this role than other available German aircraft; they never attempted to deceive the Allies and always wore full Luftwaffe markings. One B 17 of KG200, bearing the Luftwaffe's KG 200 Geschwaderkennung markings A3 FB, was interned by Spain when it landed at Valencia airfield, 27 June 1944, remaining there for the rest of the war. It has been alleged that some B 17s kept their Allied markings and were used by the Luftwaffe in attempts to infiltrate B 17 bombing formations and report on their positions and altitudes. According to these allegations, the practice was initially successful, but Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any stranger trying to join a group's formation.  Soviet interned B 17s  The U.S. did not offer B 17s to the Soviet Union as part of its war materiel assistance program, but at least 73 aircraft were acquired by the Soviet Air Force. These aircraft had landed with mechanical trouble during the shuttle bombing raids over Germany or had been damaged by a Luftwaffe raid in Poltava. The Soviets restored 23 to flying condition and concentrated them in the 890th bomber regiment of the 45th Bomber Aviation Division, but they never saw combat. In 1946 the regiment was assigned to the Kazan factory to aid in the Soviet effort to reproduce the more advanced Boeing B 29 as the Tupolev Tu 4.  Swiss interned B 17s  During the Allied bomber offensive, U.S. and British bombers sometimes flew into Swiss airspace, either because they were damaged or, on rare occasions, accidentally bombing Swiss cities. Swiss aircraft attempted to intercept and force individual aircraft to land, interning their crews; one Swiss pilot was killed, shot down by a U.S. bomber crew in September 1944. From then on, red and white neutrality bands were added to the wings of Swiss aircraft to stop accidental attacks by Allied aircraft.Official Swiss records identify 6,501 airspace violations during the course of the war, with 198 foreign aircraft landing on Swiss territory and 56 aircraft crashing there. In October 1943 the Swiss interned Boeing B 17F 25 VE, tail number 25841, and its U.S. flight crew after the Flying Fortress developed engine trouble after a raid over Germany and was forced to land. The aircraft was turned over to the Swiss Air Force, who then flew the bomber until the end of the war, using other interned but non airworthy B 17s for spare parts. The bomber's topside surfaces were repainted a dark olive drab, but retained its light gray under wing and lower fuselage surfaces. It carried Swiss national white cross insignia in red squares on both sides of its rudder, fuselage sides, and on the topside and underside wings. The B 17F also carried light gray flash letters RD and I on either side of the fuselage's Swiss national insignia.  Japanese captured B 17s  Three damaged B 17s, one D and two E series, were rebuilt during 1942 to flying status by Japanese technicians and mechanics, using parts salvaged from abandoned B 17 wrecks in the Philippines and the Java East Indies. The three bombers, which still contained their top secret Norden bombsights, were ferried to Japan where they underwent extensive technical evaluation by the Giken, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's Air Technical Research Institute at Tachikawa's air field. The D model, later deemed an obsolescent design, was used in Japanese training and propaganda films. The two E s were used to develop B 17 air combat counter tactics and also used as enemy aircraft in pilot and crew training films. One of the two E Flying Fortresses was photographed late in the war by U. S. aerial recon. It was code named Tachikawa 105 after the mystery aircraft's wingspan was measured but never identified. Photo recon analysts never made the connection to it being a captured B 17 until after the war. No traces of the 3 captured Flying Fortresses were ever found in Japan by Allied occupation forces. The bombers were assumed either lost by various means or scrapped late in the war for their vital war materials.  Postwar history   U.S. Air Force  Following the end of World War II, the B 17 was quickly phased out of use as a bomber and the Army Air Forces retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States where the majority were sold for scrap and melted down, although significant numbers remained in use in second line roles such as VIP transports, air sea rescue and photo reconnaissance. Strategic Air Command , established in 1946, used reconnaissance B 17s until 1949. The USAF Air Rescue Service of the Military Air Transport Service operated B 17s as so called Dumbo air sea rescue aircraft. Work on using B 17s to carry airborne lifeboats had begun in 1943, but they entered service in the European theater only in February 1945. They were also used to provide search and rescue support for B 29 raids against Japan. About 130 B 17s were converted to the air sea rescue role, at first designated B 17H and later SB 17G. Some SB 17s had their defensive guns removed, while others retained their guns to allow use close to combat areas. The SB 17 served through the Korean War, remaining in service with USAF until the mid 1950s.In 1946, surplus B 17s were chosen as drone aircraft for atmospheric sampling during the Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests, being able to fly close to or even through the mushroom clouds without endangering a crew. This led to more widespread conversion of B 17s as drones and drone control aircraft, both for further use in atomic testing and as targets for testing surface to air and air to air missiles. One hundred and seven B 17s were converted to drones. The last operational mission flown by a USAF Fortress was conducted on 6 August 1959, when a DB 17P, serial 44 83684 , directed a QB 17G, out of Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, as a target for an AIM 4 Falcon air to air missile fired from a McDonnell F 101 Voodoo. A retirement ceremony was held several days later at Holloman AFB, after which 44 83684 was retired. It was subsequently used in various films and in the 1960s television show 12 O'Clock High before being retired to the Planes of Fame aviation museum in Chino, California. Perhaps the most famous B 17, the Memphis Belle, has been restored with the B 17D The Swoose under way to her World War II wartime appearance by the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.  U.S. Navy and Coast Guard  During the last year of World War II and shortly thereafter, the United States Navy acquired 48 ex USAAF B 17s for patrol and air sea rescue work. The first two ex USAAF B 17s, a B 17F and a B 17G were obtained by the Navy for various development programs. At first, these aircraft operated under their original USAAF designations, but on 31 July 1945 they were assigned the naval aircraft designation PB 1, a designation which had originally been used in 1925 for the Boeing Model 50 experimental flying boat.Thirty two B 17Gs were used by the Navy under the designation PB 1W, the suffix W indicating an airborne early warning role. A large radome for an S band AN APS 20 search radar was fitted underneath the fuselage and additional internal fuel tanks were added for longer range, with the provision for additional underwing fuel tanks. Originally, the B 17 was also chosen because of its heavy defensive armament, but this was later removed. These aircraft were painted dark blue, the standard Navy paint scheme which had been adopted in late 1944. PB 1Ws continued in USN service until 1955, gradually being phased out in favor of the Lockheed WV 2 , a military version of the Lockheed 1049 Constellation commercial airliner. In July 1945, 16 B 17s were transferred to the Coast Guard via the Navy; these aircraft were initially assigned U.S. Navy Bureau Numbers , but were delivered to the Coast Guard designated as PB 1Gs beginning in July 1946. Coast Guard PB 1Gs were stationed at a number of bases in the U.S. and Newfoundland, with five at Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, North Carolina, two at CGAS San Francisco, two at NAS Argentia, Newfoundland, one at CGAS Kodiak, Alaska, and one in Washington state. They were used primarily in the Dumbo air sea rescue role, but were also used for iceberg patrol duties and for photo mapping. The Coast Guard PB 1Gs served throughout the 1950s, the last example not being withdrawn from service until 14 October 1959.  Special operations  B 17s were used by the CIA front companies Civil Air Transport, Air America and Intermountain Aviation for special missions. These included B 17G 44 85531, registered as N809Z. These aircraft were primarily used for agent drop missions over the People's Republic of China, flying from Taiwan, with Taiwanese crews. Four B 17s were shot down in these operations.In 1957 the surviving B 17s had been stripped of all weapons and painted black. One of these Taiwan based B 17s was flown to Clark Air Base in the Philippines in mid September, assigned for covert missions into Tibet. On 28 May 1962, N809Z, piloted by Connie Seigrist and Douglas Price, flew Major James Smith, USAF and Lieutenant Leonard A. LeSchack, USNR to the abandoned Soviet arctic ice station NP 8, as Operation Coldfeet. Smith and LeSchack parachuted from the B 17 and searched the station for several days. On 1 June, Seigrist and Price returned and picked up Smith and LeSchack using a Fulton Skyhook system installed on the B 17. N809Z was used to perform a Skyhook pick up in the James Bond movie Thunderball in 1965. This aircraft, now restored to its original B 17G configuration, was on display in the Evergreen Aviation Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon until it was sold to the Collings Foundation in 2015.  Operators  The B 17, a versatile aircraft, served in dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat throughout World War II, and in other roles for the RAF. Its main use was in Europe, where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft did not hamper it as much as in the Pacific Theater. Peak USAAF inventory was 4,574 worldwide.  Surviving aircraft Forty six planes survive in complete form, nine of which are airworthy, and 39 of which reside in the United States.  Fortresses as a symbol  The B 17 Flying Fortress became symbolic of the United States of America's air power. In a 1943 Consolidated Aircraft poll of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated advertisements had been run in newspapers, 73 had heard of the B 24 and 90 knew of the B 17.After the first Y1B 17s were delivered to the Army Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they were used on flights to promote their long range and navigational capabilities. In January 1938, group commander Colonel Robert Olds flew a Y1B 17 from the U.S. east coast to the west coast, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours 27 minutes. He also broke the west to east coast record on the return trip, averaging 245 mph in 11 hours 1 minute. Six bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group took off from Langley Field on 15 February 1938 as part of a goodwill flight to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Covering 12,000 miles they returned on 27 February, with seven aircraft setting off on a flight to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, three days later. In a well publicized mission on 12 May of the same year, three Y1B 17s intercepted and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner SS Rex 610 miles off the Atlantic coast.Many pilots who flew both the B 17 and the B 24 preferred the B 17 for its greater stability and ease in formation flying. The electrical systems were less vulnerable to damage than the B 24's hydraulics, and the B 17 was easier to fly than a B 24 when missing an engine. During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the Eighth Air Force, had an open preference for the B 17. Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B 17s, citing the logistical advantage in keeping field forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their individual servicing and spares. For this reason, he wanted B 17 bombers and P 51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose mission studies showed that the Flying Fortress's utility and survivability was much greater than those of the B 24 Liberator. Making it back to base on numerous occasions, despite extensive battle damage, the B 17's durability became legendary; stories and photos of B 17s surviving battle damage were widely circulated during the war. Despite an inferior performance and smaller bombload than the more numerous B 24 Liberators, a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction with the B 17.  Notable B 17s  All American This B 17F survived having her tail almost cut off in a mid air collision with a Bf 109 over Tunisia but returned safely to base in Algeria. Chief Seattle sponsored by the city of Seattle, she disappeared on 14 August 1942 flying a recon mission for the 19th BG, 435th BS and the crew declared dead on 7 December 1945. Hell's Kitchen B 17F 41 24392 was one of only three early B 17F's in 414th BS to complete more than 100 combat missions. Mary Ann a B 17D that was part of an unarmed flight which left Hamilton Air Field, Novato, California on 6 December 1941 en route to Hickam Field in Hawaii, arriving during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The plane and her crew were immediately forced into action on Wake Island and in the Philippines during the outbreak of World War II. She became famous when her exploits were featured in Air Force, one of the first of the patriotic war films released in 1943. Memphis Belle one of the first B 17s to complete a tour of duty of 25 missions in the 8th Air Force and the subject of a feature film, now completely restored and on display since 17 May 2018 at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. Miss Every Morning Fix'n B 17C. Previously named 'Pamela'. Stationed in Mackay, Queensland, Australia during World War II. On 14 June 1943, crashed shortly after takeoff from Mackay while ferrying U.S. forces personnel back to Port Moresby, with 40 of the 41 people on board killed. It remains the worst air disaster in Australian history. The sole survivor, Foye Roberts, married an Australian and returned to the States. He died in Wichita Falls, Texas, on 4 February 2004. Murder Inc. A B 17 bombardier wearing the name of the B 17 Murder Inc. on his jacket was used for propaganda in German newspapers. Old 666 B 17E flown by the most highly decorated crew in the Pacific Theater Royal Flush B 17F 42 6087 from the 100th Bomb Group and commanded on one mission by highly decorated USAAF officer Robert Rosenthal, she was the lone surviving 100th BG B 17 of 10 October 1943 raid against M nster to return to the unit's base at RAF Thorpe Abbotts. Sir Baboon McGoon B 17F featured in the June 1944 issue of Popular Science magazine and the 1945 issue of Flying magazine. Articles discuss mobile recovery crews following October 1943 belly landing at Tannington, England. The Swoose Initially nicknamed Ole Betsy while in service, The Swoose is the only remaining intact B 17D, built in 1940, the oldest surviving Flying Fortress, and the only surviving B 17 to have seen action in the Philippines campaign ; she is in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum and is being restored for final display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. The Swoose was flown by Frank Kurtz, father of actress Swoosie Kurtz, who named his daughter after the bomber. Ye Olde Pub the B 17 that was not shot down by Franz Stigler, as memorialized in the painting A Higher Call by John D. Shaw. 5 Grand 5,000th B 17 made, emblazoned with Boeing employee signatures, served with the 333rd Bomb Squadron, 96th Bomb Group in Europe. Damaged and repaired after gear up landing, transferred to 388th Bomb Group. Returned from duty following V E Day, flown for war bonds tour, then stored at Kingman, Arizona. Following an unsuccessful bid for museum preservation, the aircraft was scrapped.

Both films were made with the full cooperation of the United States Army Air Forces and used USAAF aircraft and combat footage. In 1964, the latter film was made into a television show of the same name and ran for three years on ABC TV. Footage from Twelve O' Clock High was also used, along with three restored B 17s, in the 1962 film The War Lover. An early model YB 17 also appeared in the 1938 film Test Pilot with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, and later with Clark Gable in Command Decision in 1948, in Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970, and in Memphis Belle with Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Billy Zane, and Harry Connick Jr. in 1990. The most famous B 17, the Memphis Belle, toured the U. S. with her crew to reinforce national morale . She was featured in a USAAF documentary, Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress.The Flying Fortress has also been featured in artistic works expressing the physical and psychological stress of the combat conditions and the high casualty rates that crews suffered. Works such as The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner by Randall Jarrell and Heavy Metal's section B 17 depict the nature of these missions. The Ball turret itself has inspired works like Steven Spielberg's The Mission. Artists who served on the bomber units also created paintings and drawings depicting the combat conditions in World War II.

            "text": "The decimal numeral system is the standard system for denoting integer and non integer numbers. It is the extension to non integer numbers of the Hindu Arabic numeral system. The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as decimal notation.A decimal numeral , refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified by a decimal separator . Decimal may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in 3.14 is the approximation of to two decimals . Zero digits after a decimal separator serve the purpose of signifying the precision of a value. The numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the decimal fractions. That is, fractions of the form a 10n, where a is an integer, and n is a non negative integer. The decimal system has been extended to infinite decimals for representing any real number, by using an infinite sequence of digits after the decimal separator . In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non zero digits after the decimal separator are sometimes called terminating decimals. A repeating decimal is an infinite decimal that, after some place, repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits . An infinite decimal represents a rational number, the quotient of two integers, if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of non zero digits.  Origin  Many numeral systems of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are firstly the Egyptian numerals, then the Brahmi numerals, Greek numerals, Hebrew numerals, Roman numerals, and Chinese numerals. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the Hindu Arabic numeral system for representing integers. This system has been extended to represent some non integer numbers, called decimal fractions or decimal numbers, for forming the decimal numeral system.  Decimal notation For writing numbers, the decimal system uses ten decimal digits, a decimal mark, and, for negative numbers, a minus sign . The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; the decimal separator is the dot . in many countries , and a comma , in other countries.For representing a non negative number, a decimal numeral consists of either a sequence of digits , where the entire sequence represents an integer,         a      m          a      m       1             a      0          displaystyle a m a m 1 ldots a 0  or a decimal mark separating two sequences of digits          a      m          a      m       1             a      0        .     b      1          b      2             b      n          displaystyle a m a m 1 ldots a 0 .b 1 b 2 ldots b n  .If m 0, that is, if the first sequence contains at least two digits, it is generally assumed that the first digit am is not zero. In some circumstances it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left; this does not change the value represented by the decimal: for example, 3.14 03.14 003.14. Similarly, if the final digit on the right of the decimal mark is zero that is, if bn 0 it may be removed; conversely, trailing zeros may be added after the decimal mark without changing the represented number; for example, 15 15.0 15.00 and 5.2 5.20 5.200. For representing a negative number, a minus sign is placed before am. The numeral         a      m          a      m       1             a      0        .     b      1          b      2             b      n          displaystyle a m a m 1 ldots a 0 .b 1 b 2 ldots b n  represents the number         a      m          10      m             a      m       1          10      m       1                  a      0          10      0                    b        1              10        1                           b        2              10        2                                b        n              10        n                 displaystyle a m 10 m a m 1 10 m 1 cdots a 0 10 0 frac b 1 10 1  frac b 2 10 2  cdots frac b n 10 n  .The integer part or integral part of a decimal numeral is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator . For a non negative decimal numeral, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the fractional part, which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part. When the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in computing, that the integer part is not written . In normal writing, this is generally avoided, because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation. In brief, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a positional numeral system.  Decimal fractions Decimal fractions are the rational numbers that may be expressed as a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten. For example, the decimals       0.8   ,   14.89   ,   0.00079   ,   1.618   ,   3.14159     displaystyle 0.8,14.89,0.00079,1.618,3.14159  represent the fractions 4 5, 1489 100, 79 100000, 809 500 and 314159 100000, and are therefore decimal numbers. More generally, a decimal with n digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator 10n, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator. It follows that a number is a decimal fraction if and only if it has a finite decimal representation. Expressed as a fully reduced fraction, the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are       1        2      0             5      0        ,   2        2      1             5      0        ,   4        2      2             5      0        ,   5        2      0             5      1        ,   8        2      3             5      0        ,   10        2      1             5      1        ,   16        2      4             5      0        ,   20        2      2             5      1        ,   25        2      0             5      2        ,        displaystyle 1 2 0 cdot 5 0 ,2 2 1 cdot 5 0 ,4 2 2 cdot 5 0 ,5 2 0 cdot 5 1 ,8 2 3 cdot 5 0 ,10 2 1 cdot 5 1 ,16 2 4 cdot 5 0 ,20 2 2 cdot 5 1 ,25 2 0 cdot 5 2 , ldots   Real number approximation Decimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all real numbers, e.g. for the real number . Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real , being less than 10 5 off; so decimals are widely used in science, engineering and everyday life. More precisely, for every real number x and every positive integer n, there are two decimals L and u with at most n digits after the decimal mark such that L x u and  10 n. Numbers are very often obtained as the result of measurement. As measurements are subject to measurement uncertainty with a known upper bound, the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with n digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10 n. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same number, the decimal numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 .  Infinite decimal expansion  For a real number x and an integer n 0, let x n denote the decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than x that has exactly n digits after the decimal mark. Let di denote the last digit of x i. It is straightforward to see that x n may be obtained by appending dn to the right of x n 1. This way one has x n x 0.d1d2...dn 1dn,and the difference of x n 1 and x n amounts to                            x                 n                           x                 n         1                       d      n             10          n             10          n       1          displaystyle left vert left x right n left x right n 1 right vert d n cdot 10 n 10 n 1  ,which is either 0, if dn 0, or gets arbitrarily small as n tends to infinity. According to the definition of a limit, x is the limit of x n when n tends to infinity. This is written as         x        lim      n                 x            n            textstyle ;x lim n rightarrow infty x n ; or x x 0.d1d2...dn...,which is called an infinite decimal expansion of x. Conversely, for any integer x 0 and any sequence of digits               n       1                   textstyle ; n 1 infty  the expression x 0.d1d2...dn... is an infinite decimal expansion of a real number x. This expansion is unique if neither all dn are equal to 9 nor all dn are equal to 0 for n large enough . If all dn for n N equal to 9 and x n x 0.d1d2...dn, the limit of the sequence               n       1                   textstyle ; n 1 infty  is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: dN, by dN 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s . Any such decimal fraction, i.e.: dn 0 for n N, may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing dN by dN 1 and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s . In summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of x n, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining x n as the greatest number that is less than x, having exactly n digits after the decimal mark.  Rational numbers  Long division allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. If the rational number is a decimal fraction, the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a repeating decimal. For example, 1 81 0. 012345679 012... .The converse is also true: if, at some point in the decimal representation of a number, the same string of digits starts repeating indefinitely, the number is rational. or, dividing both numerator and denominator by 6, 692 1665.  Decimal computation  Most modern computer hardware and software systems commonly use a binary representation internally . For external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related octal or hexadecimal systems. For most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. Both computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of binary coded decimal, especially in database implementations, but there are other decimal representations in use .Decimal arithmetic is used in computers so that decimal fractional results of adding values with a fixed length of their fractional part always are computed to this same length of precision. This is especially important for financial calculations, e.g., requiring in their results integer multiples of the smallest currency unit for book keeping purposes. This is not possible in binary, because the negative powers of       10     displaystyle 10  have no finite binary fractional representation; and is generally impossible for multiplication . See Arbitrary precision arithmetic for exact calculations.  History  Many ancient cultures calculated with numerals based on ten, sometimes argued due to human hands typically having ten fingers digits. Standardized weights used in the Indus Valley civilization were based on the ratios: 1 20, 1 10, 1 5, 1 2, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500, while their standardized ruler the Mohenjo daro ruler was divided into ten equal parts. Egyptian hieroglyphs, in evidence since around 3000 BCE, used a purely decimal system, as did the Cretan hieroglyphs of the Minoans whose numerals are closely based on the Egyptian model. The decimal system was handed down to the consecutive Bronze Age cultures of Greece, including Linear A and Linear B  the number system of classical Greece also used powers of ten, including, Roman numerals, an intermediate base of 5. Notably, the polymath Archimedes invented a decimal positional system in his Sand Reckoner which was based on 108 and later led the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to lament what heights science would have already reached in his days if Archimedes had fully realized the potential of his ingenious discovery. Hittite hieroglyphs were also strictly decimal.Some non mathematical ancient texts such as the Vedas, dating back to 1700 900 BCE make use of decimals and mathematical decimal fractions.The Egyptian hieratic numerals, the Greek alphabet numerals, the Hebrew alphabet numerals, the Roman numerals, the Chinese numerals and early Indian Brahmi numerals are all non positional decimal systems, and required large numbers of symbols. For instance, Egyptian numerals used different symbols for 10, 20 to 90, 100, 200 to 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, to 10,000. The world's earliest positional decimal system was the Chinese rod calculus.  History of decimal fractions  Decimal fractions were first developed and used by the Chinese in the end of 4th century BCE, and then spread to the Middle East and from there to Europe. The written Chinese decimal fractions were non positional. However, counting rod fractions were positional.Qin Jiushao in his book Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections denoted 0.96644 by   , meaning 096644J. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician Abu'l Hasan al Uqlidisi written in the 10th century. The Jewish mathematician Immanuel Bonfils used decimal fractions around 1350, anticipating Simon Stevin, but did not develop any notation to represent them. The Persian mathematician Jamsh d al K sh claimed to have discovered decimal fractions himself in the 15th century. Al Khwarizmi introduced fraction to Islamic countries in the early 9th century; a Chinese author has alleged that his fraction presentation was an exact copy of traditional Chinese mathematical fraction from Sunzi Suanjing. This form of fraction with numerator on top and denominator at bottom without a horizontal bar was also used by al Uqlidisi and by al K sh in his work Arithmetic Key . A forerunner of modern European decimal notation was introduced by Simon Stevin in the 16th century.John Napier introduced using the period to separate the integer part of a decimal number from the fractional part in his book on constructing tables of logarithms, published posthumously in 1620.: p. 8, archive p. 32   Natural languages  A method of expressing every possible natural number using a set of ten symbols emerged in India. Several Indian languages show a straightforward decimal system. Many Indo Aryan and Dravidian languages have numbers between 10 and 20 expressed in a regular pattern of addition to 10.The Hungarian language also uses a straightforward decimal system. All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly , as with those between 20 and 100 . A straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order , and in which 11 is expressed as ten one and 23 as two ten three, and 89,345 is expressed as 8  9  3  4  5 is found in Chinese, and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities. Japanese, Korean, and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is eleven not ten one or one teen . Incan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ten with one and 23 as two ten with three. Some psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children's counting ability.  Other bases  Some cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers. Pre Columbian Mesoamerican cultures such as the Maya used a base 20 system . The Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico have octal systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves. The existence of a non decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal ; such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were. Where this counting system is known, it is based on the long hundred 120, and a long thousand of 1200. The descriptions like long only appear after the small hundred of 100 appeared with the Christians. Gordon's Introduction to Old Norse Archived 2016 04 15 at the Wayback Machine p. 293, gives number names that belong to this system. An expression cognate to 'one hundred and eighty' translates to 200, and the cognate to 'two hundred' translates to 240. Goodare details the use of the long hundred in Scotland in the Middle Ages, giving examples such as calculations where the carry implies i C as 120, etc. That the general population were not alarmed to encounter such numbers suggests common enough use. It is also possible to avoid hundred like numbers by using intermediate units, such as stones and pounds, rather than a long count of pounds. Goodare gives examples of numbers like vii score, where one avoids the hundred by using extended scores. There is also a paper by W.H. Stevenson, on 'Long Hundred and its uses in England'. Many or all of the Chumashan languages originally used a base 4 counting system, in which the names for numbers were structured according to multiples of 4 and 16. Many languages use quinary number systems, including Gumatj, Nunggubuyu, Kuurn Kopan Noot and Saraveca. Of these, Gumatj is the only true 5 25 language known, in which 25 is the higher group of 5. Some Nigerians use duodecimal systems. So did some small communities in India and Nepal, as indicated by their languages. The Huli language of Papua New Guinea is reported to have base 15 numbers. Ngui means 15, ngui ki means 15 2 30, and ngui ngui means 15 15 225. Umbu Ungu, also known as Kakoli, is reported to have base 24 numbers. Tokapu means 24, tokapu talu means 24 2 48, and tokapu tokapu means 24 24 576. Ngiti is reported to have a base 32 number system with base 4 cycles. The Ndom language of Papua New Guinea is reported to have base 6 numerals. Mer means 6, mer an thef means 6 2 12, nif means 36, and nif thef means 36 2 72.  See also   Notes   References",

            "text": "The Belgrade Fortress , consists of the old citadel and Kalemegdan Park on the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, in an urban area of modern Belgrade, Serbia. Located in Belgrade's municipality of Stari Grad, the fortress costitutes the specific historical core of the city. As one of the most important representatives of Belgrade's cultural heritage, it was originally protected right after World War II, among the first officially declared cultural monuments in Serbia. The fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia. It is the most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, with Skadarlija being the second. Since the admission is free, it is estimated that the total number of visitors is over 2 million yearly.  Location Belgrade Fortress is located on top of the 125.5 metres high ending ridge of the umadija geological bar. The sandbank stretches at least from the city's Ta majdan section, originating from the Miocene period, and the oldest stages of the ancient Pannonian Sea. The cliff like ridge overlooks the Great War Island and the confluence of the Sava river into the Danube, and makes one of the most beautiful natural lookouts in Belgrade. It borders the neighborhoods of Dor ol , Stari Grad and Kosan i ev Venac . It is bounded by 3 streets: Boulevard of Vojvoda Bojovi , Tadeu a Ko u ka, Pariska, plus the railway along the riverside.  History   Classical Antiquity  Belgrade Fortress is the core and the oldest section of the urban area of Belgrade. For centuries, the city population was concentrated only within the walls of the fortress, and thus the history of the fortress, until most recent times, reflects the history of Belgrade itself . The first mention of the city is when it was founded in the 3rd century BC as Singidunum by the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, who had defeated Thracian and Dacian tribes that previously lived in and around the fort. The city fortress was later conquered by the Romans, was known as Singidunum and became a part of the military frontier , where the Roman Empire bordered barbarian Central Europe . Singidunum was defended by the Roman legion IV Flaviae, which built a fortified camp on a hill at the confluence of the Danube and the Sava rivers. In the period between 378 AD and 441 the Roman camp was repeatedly destroyed in the invasions by the Goths and the Huns. Legend says that Attila's grave lies at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube . In 476 Belgrade again became the border between the empires: the Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire , and the Slav Avar State in the north. The Celtic fortification was a primitive one, located on top of Terazije ridge, above the confluence of the Sava into the Danube, where the fortress still stands today. Celts also lived in small, open and fortified settlements around the fort, called opidums. Since it is not known for sure where the Celtic fort was; some historians suggest that it was rather close to the necropolises in Karaburma and Rospi uprija. Celtic settlements belonged to the La T ne culture.The original military camp was probably occupied by the soldiers from the Legio VIII Augusta from 46 AD to 69. Early Singidunum reached its height with the arrival of Legio IV Flavia Felix which was transferred to the city in 86 AD and remained there until the mid 5th century. The presence of Legio IV prompted the construction of a square shaped castrum , which occupied Upper Town of today's fortress. Construction began at the turn of the 2nd century AD as since the early 100s, Legio IV Flavia Felix became permanently stationed in Singidunum. At first, the fortress was set up as earthen bulwarks and wooden palisades, but soon after, it was fortified with stone as the first stone fort in Belgrade's history. The remains can be seen today near the northeastern corner of the acropolis. The legion also constructed a pontoon bridge over the Sava, connecting Singidunum with Taurunum.Rectangular castrum covered what is today the Upper Town and the Kalemegdan Park. The castrum had tall walls, built from the white Ta majdan limestone and spread over the area of 16 ha to 20 ha , being shaped as an irregular rectangle .  Middle Ages  The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I rebuilt the fortress around 535. In the following centuries the fortress suffered continuous destruction under the Avar sieges. The Slavs and Avars had their state union north of Belgrade with the Serbs and other Slavic tribes finally settling in the Belgrade area as well as the regions west and south of Belgrade in the beginning of the 7th century. The name Belgrade , which, not just in Serbian but in most Slavic languages, means a white town or a white fortress , was first mentioned in AD 878 by Bulgarians. The fortress kept changing its masters: Bulgaria during three centuries, and then the Byzantines and then again Bulgarians. The fortress remained a Byzantine stronghold until the 12th century when it fell in the hands of the newly emerging Serbian state. It became a border city of the Serbian Kingdom, later Empire with Hungary. The Hungarian king B la I gave the fortress to Serbia in the 11th century as a wedding gift , but it remained effectively part of Hungary, except for the period 1282 1319. After the Serbian state collapsed following the Battle of Kosovo, Belgrade was chosen as the capital of Despot Stefan Lazarevi in 1402. Major work was done to the ramparts which were encircling a big thriving town. The lower town at the banks of the Danube was the main urban center with a new built Orthodox cathedral. The upper town with its castle was defending the city from inland. Becoming a major trade and cultural center, Belgrade became a significant immigration town, with immigrants settling from other parts of Serbia, Dubrovnik, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Italy and Venetia. Population blossomed, so the lower city of the fortress, which was the busiest part of the city, had to be significantly expanded.Belgrade remained in Serbian hands for almost a century. After the Despot's death in 1427, it had to be returned to Hungary. An attempt by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1456 to conquer the fortress was prevented by Janos Hunyadi , saving Hungary from Ottoman dominion for 70 years.  Early Modern  In 1521, 132 years after the Battle of Kosovo, the fortress, like most parts of the Serbian state, was conquered by the Turks and remained , under the rule of the Ottoman Empire until the year 1867, when the Turks withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia. During the short period of Austrian rule , the fortress was largely rebuilt and modernized. It witnessed the Great Serbian Migration in the 17th century and two Serbian Uprisings in the 19th century, during the Turkish Period. During the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717 39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade. The City hospital of Saint John was built within the fortress walls, but its exact location is not known. Emperor Charles VI signed the Belgrade City Statute in 1724 , which mentions city hospital, city pharmacy, medics and midwives. The German municipality had low incomes so it had to ask the state for help and beneficence. The hospital is mentioned in the 1728 Census. It was a hospital already in 1719, later becoming the residence of Thomas Berger, the head of the hospital. After his death, his daughter continued to reside in the building. The hospital was moved to another location, into the newly constructed building in 1724. A small church was built next to it. This new hospital was quite small, with only 2 rooms, a kitchen and a basement, so it way not be the same city hospital.Lazaret or a quarantine hospital is not mentioned in the documents, but it is safe to presume that it had to be formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As the Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people in a cramped space, triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to bury them. The Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties. After Austria lost the Austro Turkish War of 1737 1739, northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian building it had constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished within the fortress. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls. That way, the House at 10 Cara Du ana Street, built 1724 1727, in the neighborhood of Dor ol survived, being today the oldest house in Belgrade.The 1837 plague outbreak almost brought to the war between the ruling prince Milo Obrenovi and the Ottomans in the fortress. The outbreak began in Ottoman Empire in 1836, which had no medical protocols of any kind at the time, and prince Milo blocked the borders immediately imposing the mandatory quarantine. A group of plague infected Ottoman nizams on the way to Belgrade was halted at the border in Aleksinac and placed in the quarantine, but majority of them fled and continued to Belgrade, spreading the plague on its path and ultimately reaching the fortress in the spring of 1837. The prince ordered full and strong siege of the fortress by the Serbian guardsmen, cutting the fortress off completely for six weeks. The pasha complained and threatened from inside the fortress, initially hiding and denying the disease, but the fortress Ottomans were reluctant to start military skirmish in this condition. The besieging was successful as the plague never spread to Belgrade.Four outer city gates, with the adjoining walls and ramparts were demolished from 1862 to 1866 . After the Ottomans fully evacuated the inner fortress in 1867, Serbian troops took over, but as the state was still only autonomous , Serbia was only to manage it and was not acknowledged as the proprietor of the fortress by the neighboring Austria Hungary. First squad of Serbian soldiers, under the command of colonel Svetozar Gara anin, ceremonially replaced the Ottoman guardsmen on 18 April 1867. First action by the Serbian authorities, just 5 days after the Ottomans left in April 1867, was to rebuild the Ru ica Church.After the Ottoman withdrawal, newspapers in Austro Hungary continuously published stories, backed by the military experts, that the fortress became strategically obsolete and that, having no value of any kind, Austrian army could destroy it in 24 hours. In the autumn of 1867 citizens were awaken by the heavy artillery fire. Ruling prince Mihailo Obrenovi sent two batteries to the fortress and ordered them to fire at the fortress wall where the old wooden bridge was located. A barrage fire of 300 salvos from De Bange cannons shelled the fortress during the entire day. It remained unclear why the prince ordered this: he decided to demolish the fortress completely, as such stories spread among the citizens; he wanted to show to the Austrians that the fortress has its values and importance, and that it can't be destroyed in a day of rampart was destroyed ; or he simply did it to spite the Austrians. The shelling also disturbed the citizens of Zemun, across the Sava, which was part of Austro Hungary at the time, and some of the grenades which missed the target hit Austro Hungarian soil, so the imperial government sent an official diplomatic note to Serbia, protesting the shelling and reminding the prince he is only a caretaker of the fortress.After the takeover of the fortress, Serbian forces kept finding parts of the gallows, chains, gibbets and impalement stakes in the dungeons, used previously by the Ottomans to torture the prisoners. Official reports by the Serbian army hold claims by the soldiers of the ghoulish, headless and limbless wraiths and other abominations roaming the fortress. The army issued an order that, despite there was no enemy anymore, all guards must keep watch at least in pairs . Mihailo's successor, prince and later king Milan Obrenovi , ordered the leveling of the terrain in the eastern sections of the fortress and planting of the greenery and trees, which in time developed into the Kalemegdan Park.  Modern  While it was inhabited, the fortress formed one of the quarters in the administrative division of Belgrade. It was called Grad for administrative purposes, and continued to be translated in the foreign languages as fortress . According to the censuses, it had a population of 2,219 in 1890, 2,281 in 1895, 2,777 in 1900, 2,396 in 1905 and 454 in 1910.Kalemegdan was the location of the second airport in Serbia, after one in the neighborhood of Banjica from 1910. A field in the Donji Grad was adapted for planes in January 1911. It was situated along the bank of the Sava river, from the old Turkish bath to the mouth of the Sava into the Danube. One of the flight pioneers, Edvard Rusjan, died in an airplane crash after taking off from this field and being hit by the gust of ko ava on 9 January 1911. Remains of Rusjan's plane were originally exhibited in Donji Grad and his funeral was one of the largest recorded in Belgrade. Surviving rib of this airplane became the first exhibit in the predecessor of the modern Aeronautical Museum Belgrade. Today, the area is used by the parachutists and paragliders and as the location of the air shows for sports and ultra light aviation. In June 2021 it was announced that the memorial bench dedicated to Rusjan will be placed below the fortress and that surrounding green area will be named the Edvard Rusjan Park.The fortress and the park were damaged during World War I. Serbian army had no proper weaponry to fight the Austro Hungarian gunboats, so they freely fired at the city from the Sava. The city was especially damaged during the heavy bombardment in 1914 1915. Diplomat and author Radoje Jankovi described it in 1914: Kalemegdan is trimmed , the trees in the park are battered, the ancient ramparts of Singidunum crushed, all being hit by the heavy, modern artillery, from precisely measured distance and even more precisely unmeasured hatred . Heavy fighting occurred in the Lower Town in 1915, when Serbian forces, led by major Dragutin Gavrilovi , persistently but ultimately unsuccessfully, fought the invading Austro Hungarian army.In 1928, building company umadija proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called air tram . The project was planned to connect Zemun to Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized, but the idea of the cable car was revived in the 21st century. Funiculars were also planned, to connect the Upper and the Lower Town. The entire Lower town was planned for demolition, with the plans including large amusement park, museums, artificial lake, zoo, and stadiums instead of the existing military barracks. Instead of everything, the railway was conducted around the foothills of the fortress, encircling it completely, and effectively cutting it off from the Sava river, which wasn't universally accepted among the architects and urbanists of the day.During his visit to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Yugoslav prime minister Milan Stojadinovi was fascinated by the objects built for the games, especially by the grandiose Olympic Stadium. He instigated the Yugoslav Olympic Committee to nominate Belgrade as the host of the 1948 Olympics and invited Werner March, architect of the Berlin stadium, to visit Belgrade and design objects for the games. March came to Belgrade in May 1938 and suggested the Fortress' Lower Town as the location for the Olympic complex. Without architectural design competition or bidding, Stojadinovi 's government accepted his idea and gave him carte blanche regarding the design. The project was finished in 1939 and the architectural model was exhibited in October 1940 at the Exhibition of the new German architecture in the German pavilion at the Belgrade Fair.In the early 1940, March began the preparatory works, as he also planned the partial remodeling of the fortress outside of the sports complex, too. He incited archaeological survey and invited German architectural historian Daniel Krencker to study the excavations. Within the scopes of the Nazi expansion of the megaprojects, and augmentation of the German historic role and importance in this region, Krencker praised March's project as the artistic dream, which represents rare and major German cultural act which will contribute to the old German glory of Belgrade . Just few days after German scientists left the fortress, Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Olympic complex was pushed aside, shifting the focus of the Germans to the archaeological exploration of the fortress during the war.The fortress suffered further damage during World War II. Military Museum was damaged in the April 1941 bombing, and subsequently looted. It was immediately placed under the authority of the German Military Museums Chief. repaired, and reopened for public in July 1941. After almost two millennia of continuous sieges, battles and conquests, the fortress is today known as the Belgrade Fortress. The present name of Kalemegdan Park derives from two Turkish words, kale and meydan , literally meaning fortress field . After World War II, before skiing facilities were built on the mountains further from Belgrade, the slopes of Kalemegdan , were used by Belgraders for skiing. Also, immediately after the war, some parts of the fortress were closed for public. In some parts the new, Yugoslav People's Army was stationed, while others were closed because of the ammunition left behind.In 2018 it was announced that the entire riverbanks section from the Branko's Bridge on the Sava, to the Pan evo Bridge on the Danube, will be transformed into the linear park, patterned after the High Line park in New York City and Zaryadye Park in Moscow. It would encircle the Belgrade Fortress. In April 2019 it was announced that the park will stretch for 4.7 km , covering an area of 47 ha . In August 2021, city expanded the project to 66 ha , but only 22.8 ha will actually make the green corridor, while the rest will be privately owned residential buildings, commercial venues and sports fields. This caused negative comments from experts. New design would actually push people away from the river, to walk along the present boulevard which encircles the fortress. The fortress itself will end up being additionally degraded and devalued, so architects and archaeologists suggested surveys, explorations and conservation of the fortress' foothills instead. The park project was described as a smokescreen, with the actual purpose of selling the riverbanks to the private investors and elevating the real estate prices.  Archaeology   World War II  Already in April 1941, professor and major Johann von Reiswitz was appointed to the Referat for the Protection of the Cultural Values in Serbia. He saved numerous cultural objects in Serbia, which won him praise even from some Serbian historians after the war. On 20 October 1941 the Lower Town was fenced on his orders of keeping and protecting the fortress. He also began archaeological digging. However, the right to dig in the fortress was asked from both the pseudo scientific organization Ahnenerbe and the Main Work Group Southeast of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. Pressured financially and politically, von Reiswitz felt he must side with one of them, so he arranged the participation of Ahnenerbe with organization's head Walther W st in October 1941. Based on this, collaborationist Minister for Education and Religion Velibor Joni issued the permit on monopoly to Ahnenerbe's Secretary General Wolfram Sievers in February 1942.Austrian prehistorian Friedrich Holste was selected to conduct the survey, but he was killed in May 1942 near Kharkiv, Ukraine, before reaching Belgrade. He was replaced with Wilhelm Unverzagt, director of the Berlin's Museum for Prehistory and Early History. Joined by Sievers and Herbert Jankuhn, Heinrich Himmler's close associate, Unverzagt began targeted digging, searching for the material proof to confirm the German idea of transforming Belgrade into Prinzeugenstadt. He specifically searched for the monumental gate at the entry into the Lower Town, built during the Nicolas Doxat's rebuilding of Belgrade under the orders of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the 1720s and 1730s. The gate was named after the Holy Roman Emperor from that period, Charlies VI. Already on 15 July 1941, secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior Wilhelm Stuckart sent memo, asking for Belgrade to be transformed into the Reich's Fortress . It was to be connected military with the copper and gold Bor mines and the Danube's Iron Gates gorge, to create the Banat area protection zone. This zone was intended to become Eugenia, or Prinz Eugen's District, where Danube Swabians were to settle and expand.The digging lasted through 1942 and 1943, when it was stopped after the Allied bombing of Belgrade began. By 1943, the Germans completely rebuilt the Gate of Charles VI, in greatest detail. Reconstruction included the cartouche with the initials of the emperor on the capital from the outer side, and the supposed coat of arms of never existing Tribalia, on the inner side . As the motif of this coat of arms appeared in medieval Serbian seals and was adopted as part of the Serbian coat of arms after First Serbian Uprising in 1804, it was meant to show the incorporation of Serbia into the western empire. The gate was damaged already during the heavy Allied Easter bombing in April 1944.It is not known whether Ahnenerbe was searching for something specifically or just wanted to falsify the route by which Aryans reached Germany from the Middle East. Some surviving documents show that they discovered remains of Celtic and Gothic settlements, a trench from the Roman period and relics from the Austrian rule after the conquest of Eugene of Savoy. Some sources claim that after the bombing started, documentation and part of the artifacts were transported to Lebus, in Germany and are considered to be lost. Others claim that the entire material was stored in the Belgrade City Museum. What is known for sure is that during the terrain cleaning in 1941 1942, the Germans completely destroyed the foundations of the Austrian artillery barrack built in the 1723 1736 period.  Post war  On 29 February 1952 the city adopted the Decision on protection, adaptation and maintenance of the people's park of Kalemegdan which set the borders of the protected areas as the rivers of Danube and Sava and the streets of Tadeu a Ko u kog and Pariska. In 1962, Belgrade's Institute for the cultural monuments protection expanded the zone to several blocks across the streets. Detailed plan on Kalemegdan from 1965 provided that, despite the immense archaeological value that lies beneath the fortress ground, basically only what was discovered by that time can be explored, restored or protected. That caused the problem both for the expansion of the park but even more for the further exploration of the fortress' underground. Best example is the Lower Town where neither the park fully developed nor the remains of the former port, which was located there, are visible.The area of the fortress is 66 ha . By 2000, only 5 of that area was archaeologically surveyed, and by 2010 that number rose to 12 or 8 ha . Based on the findings so far, it is estimated that during the rule of despot Stefan Lazarevi in the first half of the 15th century, when Belgrade became capital of Serbia, the city within the fortress had 5,600 to 12,000 inhabitants. Archaeological examinations were done on the following locations: Upper Town in the inner fortress; surveyed 1948 2009; found remains belong to the Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish Austrian period waterfront rampart in Lower Town 1963 2010; Middle Ages and Turkish Austrian period Kalemegdan Park 1973 2010; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish Austrian period Belgrade Zoo 1988; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish Austrian periodIn September 1969 major discoveries were announced. The appearance of the Lower Town was almost completely changed after the excavation. The medieval cobblestone was uncovered, so as the old ramparts and gates. In the process, the Lower Town was made more accessible to the visitors, including the new stairway and reconstruction of the part of the medieval rampart. In the Upper Town, four large, massive pillars from the period of despot Stefan Lazarevi were discovered. They are remains of the medieval bridge which was located in front of the main entry into the inner fort of the city. The fort was surrounded by the deep trench. It was previously known that an inner, bascule bridge existed within the fortress, which survived until the 17th century, but its exact location and type of construction were unknown.The explored sections after 2000 include the access downhill path to the Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, the bastion on the Sava slope, the gates of King, Sava, Dark and Kara or e, the Great Ravelin, etc. During the 2017 reconstruction of the Mehmed Pa a Sokolovi 's Fountain, next to Defterdar's Gate in the Gornji Grad, several archaeological discoveries were made. Remnants of the Roman castrum, two urns from the Bronze Age and remains of the Neolithic object were discovered. The findings were conserved and reburied.  Features Belgrade Fortress is generally divided into four sections. The four sections, two of which make the fortress itself and two make Kalemegdan park today, were divided by the Tsarigrad Road, on the location of modern pedestrian path next to the Cvijeta Zuzori Art Pavilion.  Lower Town  Donji Grad ; occupies the slope towards the riversides, from the top spot . Between the lowest section and the Danube is Kula Neboj a , which has been turned into a museum of the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, who was strangled by the Turks in this tower and his corpse thrown into the Danube. Donji Grad, like the neighboring Savamala, frequently suffers from flooding, and Kula Neboj a suffered extensive damage during the major floods of 2006. The Orthodox churches of Ru ica and Sveta Petka are also located in this area, as is the Belgrade Planetarium. The modern church of Sveta Petka was projected by architect Momir Korunovi . Construction began in the first half of the 1930s, on the location of an old chapel. It was consecrated on 27 October 1937, the feast day of Parascheva of the Balkans, called Petka in Serbian.During the tenure of mayor Dragan ilas , the idea of expanding the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, to some suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.Apart from the protection of the fortress as the cultural monument, parts of the Lower Town, and the slope which separates it from the Upper Town are protected as a natural monument. The area was included in the first protection of the fortress in 1946. In 1968 two areas were separately protected: Maritime Neogenic Ridge profile under the Pobednik monument in Kalemegdan and Geological geographical layers at Kalemegdan locality, at the Pobednik monument . Serbian Environmental Agency drafted a study on the area and submitted it to the government in 2017. In February 2021, the government joined two previously protected area and expanded the protected area to 14.07 ha , establishing a natural monument of Kalemegdan Sandbank. The area is a unique geological feature in Serbia, as the remains of the sea ridge of the oldest stage in the history of the Pannonian Sea. Those include sediments originating from the middle, Badenian stage of the Miocene period. The cliffs are thought to have a historical importance also the Slavic name of Belgrade, white town, according to one of the theories, originates from the exposed white layers of Miocene limestone on top of which the city was built.  Church of the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God  The Church of the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God, which also served as the cathedral church, was built sometimes in the 12th century, during the restored Byzantine rule. The church contained a miraculous icon of the Mother of God. It is recorded that the Byzantine princess and Serbian queen Simonida worshiped the icon in 1315 when she visited Belgrade. The structure itself was a large, three nave church with a large dome. As Belgrade was generally neglected in the second half of the 14th century, the church also deteriorated a lot.When the Hungarians handed over the city to Serbian despot Stefan Lazarevi , he began massive reconstruction of the fortress, including the church, which was restored and expanded. Chronicler Constantine the Philosopher described the church, including the famed icon of the Mother of God, relics of Saint Petka and Saint Empress Theophano , icons of the Twelve apostles , and the reliquary containing a hand. Despot added the choirs and the monastery complex around it. The church became the seat of the Metropolitan of Belgrade, this time of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and he was proclaimed the exarch of all Serbian lands .Over two decades later, when Belgrade was returned to the Hungarians, the building of the Metropolitan's Seat was built next to it. On the very day the Ottomans conquered Belgrade, 29 August 1521, they turned the church into the mosque. The cross was removed from the top of the roof, the icons were painted over and the church bells were remelted. Already tomorrow, Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent observed the main Islamic Friday prayer, the jumu'ah namaz, in the former church. When Suleiman resettled Belgrade Christians to Constantinople, they took with them the icon of the Mother of God and relics of Saint Petka and Saint Theophano. Part of them were settled in the Istanbul's neighborhood today known as Belgradkap , or Belgrade Gate, where they built the Church of Theotokos, and presumably kept the icons and relics. Interiors and all the relics in this church were destroyed during the 1955 Istanbul pogrom.Close to the church, the Ottomans dug into the ground a large gunpowder magazine. During the Austrian attack under the Eugene of Savoy, the Austrian army directly hit the magazine on 17 August 1717 causing an explosion which demolished almost all structures in the Lower Town, including the church. During their massive reconstruction of the fortress, and construction of the Baroque Belgrade which ensued in 1720 1739, the Austrians never reconstructed the church. Furthermore, in order to level the terrain in the Lower Town, they completely demolished the church ruins. Today, it is not known for neither where the church was exactly located, nor what its exterior looked like.The only surviving part of the church are remains of the marble lintel with the incomplete ktetor's inscription by despot Stefan Lazarevi :          ...             ...  ... It was accidentally discovered in 1967. Larger remains of the Metropolitan's Seat were discovered in 1977. They include arched open walls of the former porch. In February 2021, city announced it will finance the archaeological surveys on the locations where the church may have been built, in hope that at least the foundations of the church are preserved being buried underground.  Upper Town  Gornji Grad , the upper section of fortress, turned into a park, with beautiful promenades and the statue of The Victor , the so called Roman well , actually built by the Austrians, the Popular Observatory in the Despot Stefan Tower, the t rbe of Damad Ali Pasha, Mehmed Pa a Sokolovi 's Fountain, tennis and basketball courts, etc.  Gunpowder magazine  Also adapted for visits is the Great Austrian gunpowder magazine, built during the Austrian occupation of Belgrade 1718 39, after they destroyed the old one during the 1717 Siege of Belgrade. They directly hit the magazine with a cannonball and the explosion which followed allowed the Austrians to capture the city. The object is located below the 7 m tall rampart. The magazine is today embellished with the artifacts from the Roman period which were discovered in or around the fortress: tombstone stelae, monuments, altars and the Sarcophagus of Jonah, which originates from the 3rd century AD. It was arranged and opened for visitors in 2014.One of the Roman marble monuments, exhibited since 2012, was the so called Herkulanka . They were usually honorary representations of important women. Estimated to be work of some local sculptor to represent one of the more important female residents of Singidunum, it was made in c.300 and was found close to the Military Museum. The represented woman is rich, in heavily draped chiton, with the himation mantle wrapped over the arm and head. In May 2020, there was a break in the magazine's lapidarium, and the Herkulanka was vandalized and broken.  Roman well  The present facility, called the Roman Well, is neither Roman nor a well. It is located along the southwest rampart of the Upper Town, in the vicinity of the Pobednik monument and the King's Gate . An underground object existed during the mediaeval period and is referenced by Constantine of Kostenets during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarevi , in the first half of the 15th century. It apparently was a dungeon as it was mentioned during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade when 30 Hungarian conspirators died in it after their scheme to let the Turks into the fortress and surrender the city to them was thwarted. They were to be paid by the Turks, but were discovered and dropped into the pit with ropes. They were left there without food and after they began losing their minds from hunger, they were thrown knives to kill each other. Turkish traveler Evliya elebi in 1660 wrote about the object as the grain silo. After the Austrians occupied the northern Serbia in 1717, it was obvious that there is a problem of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn't practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of 50 m . It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to 54 m , which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it. The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked at the same time when operated. Water was then climbing , being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it got rotten and completely disappeared in time, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the industrial period in Belgrade. The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a double spiral staircase which descends 35 m down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy. The diameter of the shaft is 3.4 m . The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman. In 1940 the Yugoslav Royal Army emptied the well, measured it and cleaned it. Because of that, during the World War II an urban myth spread through Belgrade claiming that the gold from the National bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was hidden in the well. German occupation forces sent three divers to check the bottom of the well, but all three disappeared. Some of the Yugoslav soldiers apparently carved a number 1940 near the bottom of the well. In 1954 a man threw his mistress into the well. Police wanted to prove that he killed her so the divers were dispatched to find the body, but they failed. Still, her body resurfaced ten days later. This story served as an inspiration for Du an Makavejev when he wrote and directed the movie Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1967. In 1964 Alfred Hitchcock visited the well and praised the ambience . In 1967 1968, new exploration of the object was conducted. The divers discovered that the bottom is full of sludge and retrieved a number of skeletons, several animal ones and two human. In 1987 the divers explored whether there is a connection between the well and the Sava, but found no tunnel. The bottom was flat, there was one park bench in the water and a huge number of coins. The Roman Well served as an inspiration for another movie Lavirint, which was nominated by Serbia for an Oscar in 2002. During the 2006 dive, a miniature, 5 mm long amphipoda, previously undiscovered in Serbia, was found. It was closed in 2007, reconstructed and reopened in March 2014, but as of 2017 the upper section is open for visitors while the descent is forbidden due to the safety reasons.Divers explored it again in November 2017. The bottom wasn't flat anymore as the bench and coins were covered with a thick layer of some 15 m3 of construction waste, iron bars, reflector lights, wired trash bins, etc., which all made the well 1.5 m shallower. Cans, plastic bottles and lids were floating on the water, while a pile of new coins formed. The divers suggested that the well should be cleaned at least once a year. Still, the water was unusually clear, with artificial reflector light it was transparent all the way to the bottom, or 14 m and had a temperature of 12 C . After 300 years, speleothems began to form near the bottom of the well.Existence of another water well, sort of a twin of the Roman well, is not widely known today. This well, built on the same principle and being about the same depth, is located away from the fortress, below the modern Monument to Vuk Karad i in the Vukov Spomenik neighborhood.  Damad Ali Pasha's t rbe   The t rbe is located on the central plateau of the Upper Town and is one of the few remaining monuments of Islamic architecture in Belgrade. It was named after Damad Ali Pasha, a Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire 1713 16, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The mausoleum, however, is younger. It was built in 1784 over the grave of Izzet Mehmed Pasha, another Grand Vizier and a muhafiz, or governor, of Belgrade. The t rbe was badly damaged during the First Serbian Uprising, so the Ottoman governor of Serbia, Marashli Ali Pasha, reconstructed it in 1818 19 and dedicated it to Damad Ali Pasha. Another two muhafiz, this time administering only the fortress as Serbia gained autonomy, were buried in the t rbe: Selim Sirri Pasha in 1847 and Hasan Pasha in 1850.The mausoleum is made of stone, with a regular hexagonal base. The sides are 4 m long, it is 7 m tall with a diameter of 8 m . A thorough renovation began in May 2017 and should be finished by October. The wiring and the roof are replaced, the floor was drained and the inner and outer conservation was done. Old roof tiles were broken so the water poured inside. The roof tiles, which were not the original roof cover, were replaced with the lead cover and new, modern roof tiles, rotten wooden floor was replaced with the brick slabs and the wooden covering of the tomb was also replaced.  Museum of Natural History  The venue is located on the Great Ravelin. It was built in the 1830s or the 1840s. It originally served to house Ottoman guardsmen, so it is not a spacious object, covering 100 m2 . In 1957, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting was relocated from the Residence of Prince Milo in Top ider into the building. In 1973, the museum was annexed to the Museum of Natural History. After the Museum of Forestry and Hunting was officially abolished in 1994, the building became a gallery of the Museum of Natural History. It has 35,000 visitors yearly.  Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments  The original building was built from 1902 to 1904, to serve as the headquarters of the Serbian General Staff. It was demolished during the Austro Hungarian bombing of Belgrade across the Sava in October 1915. It was decided to build the new headquarters on the same location. In the post war situation, when funds were low and urgency was needed to repair the damages, it was decided to erect two temporary structures. One building was constructed on the location of the First Southwest Rampart's bastion, while the other one was built on the foundations of the 1904 building.The rebuilt building was designed by Janko afarik, in the typical manner of the 19thy century Serbian urban architecture. Facade and surrounding features include socle made of natural stone, side staircase of artificial stone, and fence and candelabra made of cast iron. When the general staff was moved into the new building in the Kneza Milo a Street in 1928, the building in the fortress was turned into the Military museum. In 1956, the museum was relocated to the nearby, much larger building of the Military and Geography Institute, the auxiliary building on the rampart was demolished, and the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments moved into the remaining building in 1961. The building's facade was fully renovated in the fall of 2021.  Bunker  In 1948, after the Informbiro resolution and the ensuing Tito Stalin split, a construction of the defensive bunker began on the fortress. In the process, the 5 m thick rampart of the original Neboj a Tower was discovered. It was destroyed and by 1949 the bunker which covers 200 m2 was finished. The tallest point of the bunker is the cannon dome which was used for the artillery and military units. Abandoned later, it was adapted for the tourists and opened in December 2012. It has parts of the authentic inventory from the 1950s: safety doors, beds, ventilation, water tanks, etc.  Basketball monument  On 12 December 2018, a monument officially called Monument to the Founding Fathers of Serbian and Yugoslav Basketball School was dedicated. The date was symbolic, as it also marked 95 years since the first basketball arrived in Serbia and 70 years since the founding of the basketball association. The monument is located in a small park area between the basketball courts of Partizan and Crvena Zvezda .As written on the inscription, the monument is dedicated to the members of the Yugoslavia national basketball team which qualified for the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Argentina. Four players from this team became members of the FIBA Hall of Fame: Neboj a Popovi , Aleksandar Nikoli , Radomir aper and Borislav Stankovi . The sculpture was built on the initiative of the former basketball player Nata a Kova evi . The monument was designed by sculptor Rado Radenkovi , symbolizes fight for global affirmation and represents three stylized arms reaching for a basketball.  Great Kalemegdan Park  Veliki Kalemegdanski park occupies the southern corner of fortress, with geometrical promenades, the Military Museum, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting, and the Monument of Gratitude to France. At the location of the Monument of Gratitude to France there was a monument to Kara or e which was dedicated on 21 August 1913, a work of Pa ko Vu eti . There was a relief with various figures on the sides of the pedestal and Kara or e's grandson, king Peter I of Serbia attended the dedication. During the Austro Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in World War I, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on that very spot so they melted the Kara or e's monument to reuse the bronze. When the Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which still tolls from the belltower of the Ru ica Church today.  Gondola lift  In August 2017 the construction of the gondola lift, which would connect Kalemegdan with U e was announced by the city government for 2018. Construction was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as complicated and unstable . On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1m below the fortress' Sava Promenade. There is a cave 7 m below the projected station, so there is a possibility that the cave will be adapted for visitations and connected to the future gondola station by an elevator. On the U side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the U e Tower. The entire route is 1 km long, of which 300 m will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is 10 million and duration of works 18 months. Already existing criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station which is a collapsible locality above the cave, in the area already prone to mass wasting. Park of the Non Aligned Countries in the neighborhood of Kosan i ev Venac was proposed as the better solution.Cutting of 47 trees in the park, because of the gondola lift began in March 2019. The pine trees were 50 to 60 years old. With an enlarged price of 15 million and unified opposition to the project by the environmentalists, architects and urbanists, with additional cutting of over 100 trees in U e park across the river, this prompted popular protests. Citizens organized and as the city was cutting the trees, they were planting new seedlings. Drilling also began and it was announced that the stone wall will be partially demolished, too. Municipality of Stari Grad also organized protests, demolishing fences on the construction site, filing complaints and fines against city and government officials and announcing 24 hours watch on site and demolition of any structure built in the meantime. Construction of the gondola lift is prohibited by the current Belgrade's General Regulatory Plan from 2016 which stipulates that construction of the cables for the alternative transportation and recreation is forbidden in the area of the Belgrade Fortress.In March 2020, the fortress was voted one of the Europe's 7 most endangered heritage sites, specifically due to the planned construction of the gondola lift.  Little Kalemegdan Park  Mali Kalemegdanski park occupies the area in the eastern section, which borders the urban section of Belgrade. The northern section of Little Kalemegdan Park is occupied by the Belgrade zoo, opened in 1936. The Cvijeta Zuzori Art Pavilion is also located here.  Overview Kalemegdan is the most popular park among Belgraders and for many tourists visiting Belgrade because of the park's numerous winding walking paths, shaded benches, picturesque fountains, statues, historical architecture and scenic river views . The former canal which was used for city supplying in the Middle Ages is completely covered by earth but the idea of recreating it resurfaced in the early 2000s. Belgrade Fortress is known for its kilometers long tunnels, underground corridors and catacombs, which are still largely unexplored. In the true sense, fortress is today the green oasis in the Belgrade's urban area. As a combination of several habitats , Kalemegdan may be interesting for overseas tourists birdwatchers as it provides a snapshot of local bird fauna. It is also important as the resting spot for small passerine birds on migration, before or after crossing the rivers Sava and Danube. Kalemegdan has its own eBird hotspot and associated webpage at Kalemegdan Hotspot The Belgrade Race Through History, an annual 6 km footrace, takes place in the park and fortress as a way of highlighting the history and culture of the area.The Belgrade Fortress was nominated by the Serbian government for the UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Architects and urbanists think that possible inclusion on the list will protect the fortress from aggressive transitional construction . In that case, the outlines of the fortress and a panoramic view on it will have to be preserved. The perceived visual pollution encompasses several objects. A gigantic object, a late 2000s project by the Zaha Hadid's studio, on the northern side of the fortress, down the slope of Danube. The project, despite some preparatory works, still didn't start off. The other was the spiral project Cloud by Sou Fujimoto, which was to connect the Sava port to the fortress, but the project was scrapped after 2013 when the mayoral tenure of ilas ended. The third project is controversial Belgrade Waterfront project. The fortress in general functions as a major archaeological, artistic and historical treasury. As of 2014 it comprised: 19 memorial busts of important people from Serbian history, science and arts 6 monuments and memorials 4 restaurants and coffee shops 4 sports terrains 3 sculptures 2 fountains 2 drinking fountains 2 churches 2 galleries 2 museums Cvijeta Zuzori Art Pavilion, City Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments, Belgrade Planetarium, Luna Park, Belgrade Zoo, People's Observatory, Music Pavilion, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts' Archaeological Institute's Science and Research Center for the Fortress, Memorial Ossuary for the 1914 15 defenders of Belgrade Tomb of People's Heroes, containing the remains of the Communist party members and war heroes Ivan Milutinovi , uro akovi , Ivo Lola Ribar and Mo a Pijade. The tomb was built for the first three in 1948, using the granite slabs intended for the construction of the Church of Saint Sava. Stevan Bodnarov sculptured their busts in 1949. After his death in 1957, Pijade was also buried in the tomb, and his bust, work of Slavoljub Stankovi , was added in 1959. The complex was declared a cultural monument in 1983. Since the 1990s, the tomb has been frequently vandalized. After being vandalized three times in one year, members of organizations claiming Communist heritage organized citizens' watches to guard the tombs in December 2020, but desecrations continued in 2021 and 2022.  Concerts and shows The flat grounds below the fortress are occasionally used as open air concert location during late spring and summer: 3 September 1997: Partibrejkers Belgrade Beer Fest, annually from 2003 until 2007 18 June 2011: Amy Winehouse and Moby 15 September 2012: Warriors Dance Festival 24 May 2013: or e Bala evi 27 May 2013: Green Day 14 June 2013: Whitesnake 22 June 2013: Bajaga i Instruktori 17 June 2014: Iron Maiden 13 August 2017: Interpol 27 August 2018: Jessie Ware 8 September 2018: 2CellosFurthermore, KK Partizan and Red Star concrete basketball courts on the fortress have been used for concerts: 26 June 2009: Simply Red 11 July 2011: MTV Free Concert 26 May 2018: Hladno Pivo Additionally, a small walled in part of the fortress near its bottom is known as Barutana. It functions as an open air club during late spring, summer, and early fall, mostly featuring EDM acts. Among the shows featured in Barutana are: 31 July 2016: Talamasca 8 June 2018: Hern n Catt neo Nick Warren  Gallery             See also  Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance Gates of Belgrade Tourism in Serbia Military Museum Ru ica Church List of Ottoman military governors of Belgrade Fortress  References   External links  Official website 3Digital reconstruction of the Belgrade Fortress as it looked in the 15th century A brief history of Belgrade Fortress Kalemegdan and the Belgrade fortress Kalemegdan images The History of Belgrade Fortress",

It is the largest and the busiest airport in Serbia, situated 18 km west of downtown Belgrade near the suburb of Sur in, surrounded by fertile lowlands. It is operated by French conglomerate Vinci Airports and it is named after Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla . The flag carrier and the largest airline of Serbia, Air Serbia, uses Belgrade Nikola Tesla as their hub. It is also one of the many operating bases for low cost airline Wizz Air. The air taxi services Air Pink, Eagle Express and Prince Aviation also call the airport their home.  History   First airfields  The first airfield in Belgrade was inaugurated in 1910 in the neighbourhood of Banjica and was initially used by aviation pioneers such as Simon, Maslenikov, Vidmar and ermak. Two years later a wooden hangar was built for the Serbian Air Force, which was at the time engaged in the First Balkan War against Turkey. In 1914, the Banjica airfield was the base for the Serbian Air Force squadron and the Balloon Company. After the end of the First World War, the Banjica airfield was used for airmail traffic and included the routes Novi Sad Belgrade Ni Skoplje and Belgrade Sarajevo Mostar.In 1911 another airfield was inaugurated in Belgrade, in the lower city of the Kalemegdan Fortress at the location of today's Belgrade Planetarium.  Airport in Pan evo  An airport on the outskirts of Pan evo, a town located northeast of Belgrade, began its operations in 1923 when CFRNA inaugurated the international route Paris Istanbul which was flown via Belgrade. It was on that route that same year that the first world night flight ever happened in history. The same year airmail service began operating from the airport. The Pan evo airport was also used by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force academy. After the World War II the airport was used by the Yugoslav Air Force before it became the airfield of the Utva Aviation Industry after its relocation from Zemun to Pan evo.  Airport in Dojno Polje  Because of the distance from Pan evo to downtown Belgrade, which at that time required crossing the Danube, a decision was made to build a new airport which would be closer. The airport was planned to be built just across the river Sava, in a neighborhood today known as Novi Beograd. It was opened on 25 March 1927 under the official name of Belgrade International Airport . From February 1928, the aircraft owned by the first local airline Aeroput started taking off from the new airport. The airport had four 1,100 2,900 metres long grass runways. The design for a reinforced concrete hangar that was built at the airfield was made by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovi , better known for his theory of climate change. A modern terminal building was built in 1931, while the landing equipment for conditions of poor visibility was installed in 1936.Before World War II, Belgrade was also used as a stopover for some major air races, such as The Schlesinger African Air Race.Besides Aeroput, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, Imperial Airways and airlines from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Poland also used the airport until the outbreak of the Second World War. Belgrade gained further prominence when Imperial Airways introduced inter continental routes through Belgrade, when London was linked with India through the airport. Belgrade was linked with Paris and Breslau because CIDNA and Deutsche Luft Hansa, respectively, included Belgrade on its routes to Istanbul. By 1931, Belgrade became a major air hub being linked with regular flights with international destinations such as London, Madrid, Venice, Brussels, Berlin, Cologne, Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Varna, Thessaloniki, Athens, Istanbul, and also intercontinental links with Cairo, Karachi and India.Starting from April 1941, German occupation forces used the airport. During 1944 it was bombed by the Allies, and in October of the same year the German army destroyed the remaining facilities while withdrawing from the country.The airport was rebuilt by October 1944 and until the end of the war was used by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as part of the Allied war effort.Civil transport by Yugoslav Air Force cargo planes from this airport was reinstated at the end of 1945. At the beginning of 1947 JAT Yugoslav Airlines and JUSTA took over domestic and international traffic, and from 1948 Western European airlines resumed flights to Belgrade.A constant increase in traffic and the beginning of the passenger jet era called for a significant expansion of the airport. In the meantime, a plan to build a residential and business district called Novi Beograd on the location of the airport was introduced. The officials decided therefore that a new international airport should be built near the village of Sur in to the west. The last flight to depart from the old airport was early in 1964.  Airport in Sur in  The new location for the airport was on the Sur in plateau, 15 km from Belgrade's city center. Thanks to the original planners' vision, two conditions for the airport's development were fulfilled: a location was chosen which met the navigational, meteorological, construction, technical, and traffic requirements; and the special needs for the airport's long term development were established.Building of the new airport started in April 1958 and lasted until 28 April 1962, when it was officially opened by President Josip Broz Tito. During that period a 3,000 metre long runway was built, with the parallel taxiway and concrete aprons for sixteen airplanes. The passenger terminal building occupied an area of 8,000 m2 . Cargo storage spaces were also built, as well as a technical block with the air traffic control tower and other accompanying facilities. Modern navigational equipment was installed, earning the airport the highest international classification according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.The airport stagnated during the 1990s after the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the United Nations sanctions imposed on the Serbia and Montenegro. The sanctions also included a ban on air travel. The airport had minimal passenger movement, and many facilities were in need of reparation. With a change in government and international sentiment, normal air traffic resumed in 2001. A few years later the airport's terminal 2 underwent a major reconstruction. The runway was upgraded to CAT IIIb in 2005, as part of a large renovation project. CAT IIIb is an Instrument Landing System , giving aircraft the security of landing during fog and storms. In 2006, the airport was renamed to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor and scientist, generally considered one of the world's most famous inventors. The construction of the new air traffic control center was completed in 2010. In 2011 Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport shares began trading on the Belgrade Stock Exchange .  2012 2018  In 2012, construction work on the modernization and expansion of the airport began. It was carried out on the expansion and reconstruction of the A gate and C gate departure and transit areas. As a result, an extra 2,750 square metres was added. Jetways at the A and C gates were also replaced. Also, there were plans for the construction of a new control tower as the current air control tower was built in 1962. Future expansion of current terminals should see additional 17,000 sqm added, with terminal 2 getting additional 4 jetways.  2018 present  In January 2018, the Government of Serbia granted a 25 year concession of the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the French airport operator Vinci Airports for a sum of 501 million euros. On 21 December 2018, Vinci formally took over the airport. In 2018, the airport had a sizeable increase in revenue and net income, due to Vinci Airports transaction.  Terminals Airport two terminals have a combined area of 33,000 sqm, with Terminal 2 being larger of the two, adjacent to one another terminals are connected through a hallway. The airport has 66 check in counters and 27 gates .  Terminal 1  Terminal 1 was the original and only terminal when the airport was built. The terminal handled domestic flights during the time of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro, and subsequently has come to be used for international flights, mostly by low cost and charter airlines. The terminal went through a major renovation in 2016 and 2017 when the interior was overhauled.  Terminal 2  Terminal 2 was constructed in 1979 for the airport's growing passenger numbers. The terminal has a capacity of 5 million passengers. The terminal contains airline offices, transfer desks and various retail shops. The terminal went through two major renovations: from 2004 through 2006, with the arrivals and departures areas of the terminal completely reconstructed, and another one in 2012 and 2013 when there were works on expansion and overhaul of the C platform. While not officially confirmed, it is believed that the overhauled T1 will be used by foreign carriers, while Air Serbia and Etihad Airways Partners would gain exclusive use of Terminal 2.  Airlines and destinations   Passenger  The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights as of October 2022:  Cargo  The following cargo airlines served the airport on a regular basis:  Statistics   Traffic figures   Passenger numbers   Busiest routes   Services   Security  Before the 2020 2021 2023 remodeling, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built with only one airside hallway for both departing and arriving passengers. As such, security checks used to be located at gate entrances rather than on a central location. As of 2021, however, there is a central security hall directly above the ticketing area, before passport control, where all passengers must be screened. Passport controls are placed on two entrances and the single exit of the hallway. All passengers must pass the passport control, as there are no domestic flights. An additional security check used to exist on the hallway entrance, but it was removed in 2013 as it inconvenienced passengers and was not essential for security.In 2007 the airport prohibited cars parking next to the airport terminal, instead they have to use the car park provided, as a result of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.  Lounges  Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport offers a single business class lounge, Business Club, for all airlines operating from the airport. Business Club , opened in 2011, covers an area of 250 m2 , and seats 30 guests. Airport also has a VIP lounge, with separate check in and passport control facilities also used by general aviation customers. The lounge consists of three parts the first part for leisure, second for television crew and press conferences and a third part is a presidential suite. The lounge has a total surface area of 500 m2 . The lounge is also used as a press centre, upon the arrival of VIPs. Air Serbia Premium Lounge is the first dedicated airline owned and operated lounge at the airport. It is open from 5 am 8pm every day for Air Serbia Etihad Airways business class passengers, as well as members of the Air Serbia Etihad Guest frequent flyer program and other passengers who purchase one time lounge access.  Ground transport   Car  The airport is connected to the A3 motorway via a nearby interchange. The toll station on A3 is located to the west of the interchange, and the sections to the Belgrade downtown and the Belgrade bypass are toll free. Licensed taxis from the airport to the city are available.  Bus  The following scheduled bus services connect the airport with its surroundings:  Rail  The airport does not yet have a rail connection to the city. But it is planned to build such a link.

            "text": "Benjamin Garver Lamme was an American electrical engineer and chief engineer at Westinghouse, where he was responsible for the design of electrical power machines. Lamme created an efficient induction motor from Nikola Tesla's patents and went on to design the giant Niagara Falls generators and motors and the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City.  Biography Lamme was born on a farm near Springfield, Ohio, on 12 January 1864. From an early age he tinkered with machinery and made experiments of his ideas on the Lamme family farm. He liked things that rotated, especially at high speed. In later years he was able to solve complex problems in his engineering work using mental calculations. Lamme graduated from Olive Branch High School near New Carlisle, Ohio in 1883 and subsequently entered Ohio State University and graduated with an engineering degree in 1888. In early 1889, Lamme read an article about Westinghouse forming the Philadelphia Natural Gas Company of Pittsburgh. Westinghouse hired Lamme and within a few months transferred him to the Westinghouse Electric Company. Lamme took over the stalled project of developing a practical version of Nikola Tesla's patented induction motor from Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and came up with a more efficient cage winding design. Over a period of several years, he designed a variety of electrical motors and generators. Among his eight US patents were inventions on induction motors, electrical ship propulsion, and Gyroscopic stabilizer systems. He designed the single reduction motor for street railways , the Rotary Converter, railroad electrification systems, the Westinghouse Type C Induction Motor, and the first 5000 kW generators for the giant hydroelectric generators in the Adams Power Plant at Niagara Falls, for many years the largest power station in the world. Bertha Lamme Feicht worked alongside her brother in the design of the turbogenerator at Niagara Falls. Operation began locally in 1895 and power was transmitted to Buffalo, New York, in 1896.Lamme spent many years developing advanced analysis and computational methods for designing and predicting the performance of electrical machines, doing much of the work at night because he had other duties assigned to him during the day. Among other available employees, no one else seemed able to do the computational work, so Bertha, who like her brother Benjamin had an engineering degree from Ohio State University, was recruited to aid with the computation. After a few years, she left Westinghouse to get married. The importance of Lamme's methodology was realized in 1893 when Westinghouse began designing the first Niagara Falls 5000 kW generators. Lamme designed much of the apparatus for the Westinghouse exhibit at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, including alternating current generators, induction motors, and rotary converters. In addition to his design work on the Niagara Falls alternators, Lamme designed the monster machines for the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City. Lamme became chief engineer at Westinghouse in 1903 and held the position for the rest of his life. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway adopted the Lamme s single phase electric rail system in 1905. In 1915, Lamme was nominated by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy to represent the AIEE on the Naval Consulting Board.Lamme died July 8, 1924 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 60. In his will, he established the AIEE Lamme Medal to recognize members of the AIEE for 'meritorious achievement in the development of electrical apparatus or machinery.' His will also provided for a gold medal to be awarded by the American Society for Engineering Education for accomplishment in technical teaching.  Career As technology advanced, one of Mr. Lamme s responsibilities was to recruit, evaluate, and train new engineering graduates employed by the Westinghouse Company. He developed criteria for selecting the most talented persons for the design engineering work. He developed and taught the Westinghouse Engineering Course in which those selected spent full time for six months. Lamme s great interest in the people with whom he worked was returned by their affection, esteem and admiration for him as a great engineer. He was addressed by his friends and colleagues as well as his family by the affectionate B.G. Lamme was very fond of classical music and accumulated a large collection of records.  Awards Lamme received the IEEE Edison Medal on May 16, 1919, in the Auditorium of the Engineering Societies Building the site that preceded the United Engineering Building of recent times in New York City. The citation was For Invention and Development of Electrical Machinery. The Edison Medal is presented for a career of meritorious achievements in electrical science or electrical engineering or electrical arts. On January 12, 1923 Ohio State University presented Mr. Lamme with the Joseph Sullivant Medal; the initial presentation of that award.He received the 1918 AIEE Edison Medal for his contributions to the electrical power field.  Personal life Lamme never married and made his home with his sisters. His sister and fellow Ohio State graduate, Bertha Lamme Feicht was the nation s first woman electrical engineer and the first woman who graduated in a major field of engineering other than areas related to civil engineering. She worked at Westinghouse as an electrical design engineer under her brother s direction until her marriage to fellow Westinghouse engineer, Russel Feicht. Bertha worked on the turbogenerator for the Niagara Falls project. In his will he also provided that a gold medal be presented annually to a technical graduate of his alma mater, Ohio State University, for meritorious achievement in engineering.

            "text": "Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, writer, and Catholic theologian. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal's earliest mathematical work was on conic sections; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines , establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.Like his contemporary Ren Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum in 1647. In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pens es, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascal's Wager, known in the original as the Discourse on the Machine, a fideistic probabilistic argument for God's existence. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids. Throughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.  Life   Early life and education  Pascal was born in Clermont Ferrand, which is in France's Auvergne region, by the Massif Central. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, tienne Pascal , who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the Noblesse de Robe . Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte. In 1631, five years after the death of his wife, tienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became a key member of the family. tienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.   Essay on Conics  Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16 year old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the Mystic Hexagram , Essai pour les coniques and sent it his first serious work of mathematics to P re Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line . Pascal's work was so precocious that Ren Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients, adding, but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16 year old child.   Leaving Paris  In France at that time offices and positions could be and were bought and sold. In 1631, tienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres. The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly tienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300. Like so many others, tienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that tienne was pardoned. In time, tienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.  Pascaline  In 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid , Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Mus e des Arts et M tiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design. He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.  Mathematics   Probability  Pascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events. However, Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre Simon Laplace. In 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de M r , he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities. The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus.  Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle  Pascal's Trait du triangle arithm tique, written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal's triangle. The triangle can also be represented: He defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the th row and th column tmn. Then tmn tm 1,n tm,n 1, for m 0, 1, 2, ... and n 0, 1, 2, ... The boundary conditions are tm, 1 0, t 1,n 0 for m 1, 2, 3, ... and n 1, 2, 3, ... The generator t00 1. Pascal concluded with the proof,         t      m    n                                          n            1           .     displaystyle t mn frac  cdots n cdots 1 . In the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction. In 1654, he proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the p th powers of the first n positive integers for p 0, 1, 2, ..., k.That same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics.  Cycloid  In 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.Pascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges, and neither of the two submissions were judged to be adequate. While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren's proof in Wallis's Tractus Duo, giving Wren priority for the first published proof.  Physics  Pascal contributed to several fields in physics, most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascal's law . He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.  Fluid dynamics  His work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.  Vacuum  By 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum, i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space, rather than a vacuum. Nature abhors a vacuum. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance, moved by another substance. Furthermore, light passed through the glass tube, suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space. Following more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide , which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by R cit de la grande exp rience de l' quilibre des liqueurs published in 1648. The Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de D me mountain, 4,790 feet tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it. On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin P rier, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by P rier, reads: The weather was chancy last Saturday... but around five o'clock that morning...the Puy de D me was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work... ...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel of quicksilver ...I found the quick silver stood at 26 and 3 1 2 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot... they produced the same result each time... I attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy de D me, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23 and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case... Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines. In a reply to the plenist Estienne Noel, Pascal wrote, echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability: In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity. Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.  Adult life: religion, literature, and philosophy   Religious conversion  In the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58 year old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France, Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again... But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors. Both men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of first conversion and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year. Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his worldly period . His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him. Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind... but nothing would change her mind. By the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor... In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline, Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port Royal, which, to him, had begun to smell like a cult. With two thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29 year old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty. For a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.   The Memorial  On the 23 of November, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began: Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars... and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: I will not forget thy word. Amen. He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars. His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port Royal for a two week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.  Literature  In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists.  The Provincial Letters  Beginning in 1656 57, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period . Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18 letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments. Aside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean Jacques Rousseau. It is in the Provincial Letters that Pascal made his oft quoted apology for writing a long letter, as he had not had time to write a shorter one. From Letter XVI, as translated by Thomas M'Crie: 'Reverend fathers, my letters were not wont either to be so prolix, or to follow so closely on one another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter is a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.' Charles Perrault wrote of the Letters: Everything is there purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agr ment not to be found anywhere else.   Philosophy  Pascal is arguably best known as a philosopher, considered by some the second greatest French mind behind Ren Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes. However, he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology, empiricism, preferring fideism. He cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are, according to Wood, born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness .  Philosophy of mathematics  Pascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit g om trique , originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites coles de Port Royal . The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true. Pascal also used De l'Esprit g om trique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes. In De l'Art de persuader , Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.   The Pens es  Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed. Blaise Pascal, Pens es No. 200 Pascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pens es is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section , Sainte Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. Will Durant hailed the Pens es as the most eloquent book in French prose .The Pens es was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chr tienne . The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pens es de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologie's main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.  Last works and death  T. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world. Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, Sickness is the natural state of Christians. Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, crit sur la signature du formulaire , exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the carrosses cinq sols, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation: The carriages has a fixed route, fixed price, and left even if there were no passengers. It is widely considered that the idea of public transportation was well ahead of time. The lines were not commercially successful, and the last one closed by 1675.In 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being May God never abandon me, and was buried in the cemetery of Saint tienne du Mont.An autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two. The headaches which affected Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.

In 2004, Kahn won the Turing Award with Vint Cerf for their work on TCP IP.  Background information Kahn was born in New York to parents Beatrice Pauline and Lawrence Kahn in a Jewish family of unknown European descent. Through his father, he is related to futurist Herman Kahn. After receiving a B.E.E. degree in electrical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960, Kahn went on to Princeton University where he earned a M.A. in 1962 and Ph.D. in 1964, both in electrical engineering. At Princeton, he was advised by Bede Liu and completed a doctoral dissertation titled Some problems in the sampling and modulation of signals. He first worked at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., then in 1972 joined the Information Processing Techniques Office within DARPA. In the fall of 1972, he demonstrated the ARPANET by connecting 20 different computers at the International Computer Communication Conference, the watershed event that made people suddenly realize that packet switching was a real technology. He then helped develop the TCP IP protocols for connecting diverse computer networks. After he became director of IPTO, he started the United States government's billion dollar Strategic Computing Initiative, the largest computer research and development program ever undertaken by the U.S. federal government.After thirteen years with DARPA, he left to found the Corporation for National Research Initiatives in 1986, and as of 2022 remains its chairman, CEO and president.  The Internet While working on the SATNET satellite packet network project, he came up with the initial ideas for what later became the Transmission Control Protocol , which was intended as a replacement for an earlier network protocol, NCP, used in the ARPANET. TCP played a major role in forming the basis of open architecture networking, which would allow computers and networks all over the world to communicate with each other, regardless of what hardware or software the computers on each network used. To reach this goal, TCP was designed to have the following features: Small sub sections of the whole network would be able to talk to each other through a specialized computer that only forwarded packets . No portion of the network would be the single point of failure, or would be able to control the whole network. Each piece of information sent through the network would be given a sequence number, to ensure that they were dealt with in the right order at the destination computer, and to detect the loss of any of them. A computer which sent information to another computer would know that it was successfully received when the destination computer sent back a special packet, called an acknowledgement , for that particular piece of information. If information sent from one computer to another was lost, the information would be retransmitted, after the loss was detected by a timeout, which would recognize that the expected acknowledgement had not been received. Each piece of information sent through the network would be accompanied by a checksum, calculated by the original sender, and checked by the ultimate receiver, to ensure that it was not damaged in any way en route.Vint Cerf joined him on the project in the spring of 1973, and together they completed an early version of TCP. Later, the protocol was separated into two separate layers: host to host communication would be handled by TCP, with Internet Protocol handling internetwork communication. The two together are usually referred to as TCP IP, and form part of the basis for the modern Internet. In 1992 he co founded with Vint Cerf the Internet Society, to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and policy.  Awards He was elected as a member to the National Academy of Engineering in 1987 for research contributions in computer networks and packet switching, and for creative management contributions to research efforts in computers and communications. He was awarded the SIGCOMM Award in 1993 for visionary technical contributions and leadership in the development of information systems technology , and shared the 2004 Turing Award with Vint Cerf, for pioneering work on internetworking, including .. the Internet's basic communications protocols .. and for inspired leadership in networking. He is a recipient of the AFIPS Harry Goode Memorial Award, the Marconi Award, the ACM SIGCOMM Award, the President's Award from ACM, the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computer and Communications Award, the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal, the IEEE Third Millennium Medal, the ACM Software Systems Award, the Computerworld Smithsonian Award, the ASIS Special Award and the Public Service Award from the Computing Research Board. He has twice received the Secretary of Defense Civilian Service Award. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Pavia in 1998. He is a recipient of the 1997 National Medal of Technology, the 2001 Charles Stark Draper Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the 2002 Prince of Asturias Award, and the 2004 A. M. Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery. Kahn received the 2003 Digital ID World award for the Digital Object Architecture as a significant contribution to the digital identity industry. In 2005 he was awarded the Townsend Harris Medal from the Alumni Association of the City College of New York, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the C C Prize in Tokyo, Japan. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in May 2006. He was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum in 2006 for pioneering technical contributions to internetworking and for leadership in the application of networks to scientific research. He was awarded the 2008 Japan Prize for his work in Information Communication Theory and Technology . In 2001 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf were each inducted as an Honorary Fellow of the Society for Technical Communication in May 2006.The duo were also awarded with the Harold Pender Award, the highest honor awarded by the University of Pennsylvania School Engineering and Applied Sciences, in February 2010. He has also served on the board of directors for Qualcomm. In 2012, Kahn was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.In 2013 Kahn was one of five Internet and Web pioneers awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.  Honorary degrees Kahn has received honorary degrees from Princeton University, University of Pavia, ETH Zurich, University of Maryland, George Mason University, the University of Central Florida and the University of Pisa, and an honorary fellowship from University College, London. In 2012 he was also recognized as honorary doctor of Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics.

Kahn, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Focuses on Kahn's role in the development of computer networking from 1967 through the early 1980s. Beginning with his work at Bolt Beranek and Newman , Kahn discusses his involvement as the ARPANET proposal was being written, his decision to become active in its implementation, and his role in the public demonstration of the ARPANET. The interview continues into Kahn's involvement with networking when he moves to IPTO in 1972, where he was responsible for the administrative and technical evolution of the ARPANET, including programs in packet radio, the development of a new network protocol , and the switch to TCP IP to connect multiple networks.

            "text": "Bo e pravde is the national anthem of Serbia, as defined by the Article 7 of the Constitution of Serbia. Bo e pravde was the state anthem of the Kingdom of Serbia until 1919 when Serbia became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was re adopted as the national anthem at first by the parliamentary recommendation on the use in 2004 and then constitutionally sanctioned in 2006, after Serbia restored its independence.  History  After the assassination of Prince Mihailo, Milan Obrenovi came to the throne in 1872, celebrating his coming of age. Then he ordered a play from the manager of the National Theater in Belgrade, Jovan or evi , who quickly wrote and presented the play Marko kazuje na kome je carstvo , with the aim of glorifying Serbian history and the Obrenovi dynasty, and Bo e pravde, composed by Davorin Jenko. or evi 's song quickly gained more popularity among the people than the piece itself, and in 1882, on the occasion of Milan's enthronement as Serbian king, or evi reworked the text and so his new version became the first official anthem of Serbia. In 1903, after the May Coup, the Obrenovi dynasty died out and the Kara or evi s came to the helm of Serbia. The new Serbian king Peter I wanted to change the state symbols, even the anthem. The Austrian composer from Vienna, August Stol, composed a song for the Serbian king. Peter did not like the composition. Various competitions in which many Serbian poets participated were also unsuccessful. In the end, in 1909, it was decided to make the anthem Bo e pravde official again, with minor changes to the text. While being the national anthem of the Kingdom of Serbia, it occasionally was referred to as the Serbian national Prayer. Various rulers of Serbia changed the words of the anthem to suit them. During the rule of Prince Milan I of Serbia, the words were God, save Prince Milan , which changed to King Milan when Serbia became a kingdom. Later it was tailored to Peter I and Alexander I as well. During the time of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes , Bo e pravde was part of its national anthem. On the eve of the World War II, at the great international gathering of the Music Confederation, held in Paris, this anthem was declared one of the three most beautiful in the world. Bo e pravde anthem was officially abandoned after liberation of the country at the end of World War II in 1945, in favour of Hey, Slavs , under its Serbo Croatian title Hej, Sloveni, which was the national anthem of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 47 years, from 1945 to 1992. After the break up of Yugoslavia in 1991 1992, only Serbia and Montenegro remained in the federation i.e. the newly formed Serbia and Montenegro, but since no agreement over the anthem could be reached, Hey, Slavs remained the national anthem. Many Serbs disliked the song during this period and booed it whenever it was played, such as at sporting events. In 1992, Vostani Serbije and Mar na Drinu were proposed as the regional anthem of Serbia along with B e pravde . The latter, promulgated by then ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, even received a plurality of popular vote on referendum, but was never officially adopted.The recommendation on the use of Bo e pravde was adopted unanimously by the Parliament of Serbia in 2004 and constitutionally sanctioned in 2006, after Serbia restored independence, while the recommended text was promulgated into the law in 2009. It utilizes slightly modified original lyrics, asserting that Serbia is no longer a monarchy four verses are different. In three, Serbian king is changed to Serbian lands and in one, God save the Serbian king is changed to O God, save; O God, defend . Bo e pravde was also used as the regional anthem of the Republika Srpska, a constituency of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 2006, when it was ruled down by the country's constitutional court for being unconstitutional and the decision was upheld by the Constitutional Court of Republika Srpska.  Lyrics  The full Serbian national anthem as officially defined consists of eight stanzas, but usually only the first two are performed on public occasions for reasons of brevity. The third verse is also usually omitted in full performances.

Privately managed, it is located between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas and between 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown Manhattan. The eastern half of Bryant Park is occupied by the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. The western half, which contains a lawn, shaded walkways, and amenities such as a carousel, is located entirely over an underground structure that houses the library's stacks. The park hosts several events, including a seasonal Winter Village with an ice rink and shops during the winter. The first park at the site was opened in 1847 and was called Reservoir Square due to its proximity to the Croton Distributing Reservoir. Reservoir Square contained the New York Crystal Palace, which hosted the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853 and burned down in 1858. The square was renamed in 1884 for abolitionist and journalist William Cullen Bryant. The reservoir was demolished in 1900 and the New York Public Library's main branch was built on the site, opening in 1911. Bryant Park was rebuilt in 1933 1934 to a plan by Lusby Simpson. After a period of decline, it was restored in 1988 1992 by architecture firms Hanna Olin Ltd. and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, during which the park was rebuilt and the library's stacks were built underneath. Further improvements were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Though it is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Bryant Park is managed by the private not for profit organization Bryant Park Corporation, which was founded in 1980 and led the restoration of Bryant Park. The park is cited as a model for the success of public private partnerships. The park is both a National Register of Historic Places listing and a New York City designated landmark.  History   Early history  In 1686, when the area was still a wilderness, New York's colonial governor, Thomas Dongan, designated the area now known as Bryant Park as a public space. George Washington's troops crossed the area while retreating from the Battle of Long Island in 1776. The road upon which Washington's troops retreated traversed the park site diagonally. The city acquired the land in 1822. Beginning in 1823, Bryant Park was designated a potter's field and remained so until 1840, when thousands of bodies were moved to Wards Island.The first park at this site opened in 1847, though that park was never legally named. It was called Reservoir Square after the Croton Distributing Reservoir, which was erected on the eastern side of the park site due to its elevated location. In 1853, the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations with the New York Crystal Palace, featuring thousands of exhibitors, took place in the park. The Crystal Palace, also known as the Great Exhibition Hall, burned down in 1858. The Latting Observatory was also constructed in the park as part of the 1853 Exhibition, and was also burned down in 1856. The square was used for military drills during the American Civil War, and was the site of some of the New York City draft riots of July 1863, when the Colored Orphan Asylum at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street was burned down.Reservoir Square was renovated in 1870 1871, during which the modern day park had been laid out. Several additional structures were planned for Reservoir Square, but never built. These included an 1870 plan for new armory for the 7th New York Militia, an 1880 plan for an opera house, another plan in 1881 for a New York Historical Society building, an 1893 plan for relocating the New York City Hall building, and a 1903 plan for a general post office.  Late 19th and early 20th centuries   Renaming and library construction  In 1884, Reservoir Square was renamed Bryant Park, to honor the New York Evening Post editor and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant. Around the same time as the park's renaming, in 1883, plans emerged to build a library in Bryant Park, atop the site of the reservoir. The library would be funded by Samuel J. Tilden. This was opposed somewhat by property owners, who wanted to extend the park eastward onto the reservoir site. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, the reservoir was slated for demolition. When the New York Public Library was founded in 1895, its founders wanted an imposing main branch building.: 2 The trustees of the libraries chose to build the branch at the eastern end of Bryant Park, along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, because it was centrally located between the Astor and Lenox Libraries, the library's direct predecessors. The architects of the building, Carr re and Hastings, also planned to convert the western border along Sixth Avenue into a pedestrian arcade with a flower market, while the central portion of Bryant Park would have housed sculptures and statues. However, these plans were cancelled as a result of opposition.The reservoir was torn down by 1900, and construction started on the library. In conjunction with the library's construction, several improvements were made to the park, such as terrace gardens, public facilities, and kiosks, as well as a raised terrace adjoining the library on the eastern portion of the park.: 1 Since Bryant Park itself was located several feet above the surrounding streets, an iron fence, hedge, and embankment wall were built on the north, west, and south borders to separate the park from the bordering sidewalks. Benches were also installed along the retaining walls. Bryant Park's interior was split into three lawns, divided by a pair of west east gravel paths that aligned roughly with the sidewalks of 41st Street on the west end of the park. Four stone stairways were built: one each from Sixth Avenue's intersections with 40th and 42nd Streets, and one each from 40th and 42nd Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. In addition, 42nd Street was widened in 1910, necessitating the relocation of the fence on Bryant Park's northern border and the removal of plants there. The NYPL's Main Branch was opened on May 23, 1911.  Infrastructure and further improvements  Due to its central location in Midtown Manhattan, several transit lines and infrastructure projects were also built around Bryant Park. The first of these was the Sixth Avenue Elevated railway, which opened in 1878. The city's first subway line, now part of the 42nd Street Shuttle, was opened in 1904 by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and ran directly under 42nd Street. In the 1910s, the Hudson Manhattan Railroad also planned to extend their Uptown Hudson Tubes from Herald Square to Grand Central Terminal, with intermediate stations near Bryant Park's northeast and southwest corners, though this plan was never realized.The Catskill Aqueduct water tunnel was built under Bryant Park in the early 1910s. Once the work was complete, the affected sections of Bryant Park were restored. During World War I, Bryant Park was frequently used for patriotic rallies, and a war garden and a recreation building for Allied soldiers was erected in the park. After the end of the war in 1920, an experimental garden was placed in the park and the recreation building was destroyed. During construction of the IRT Flushing Line in the 1920s, the northern segment of Bryant Park was partly closed for four years while the subway line was constructed directly underneath. The subway tunnel ran 35 feet below ground level with a station at the eastern edge of the park, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. During construction, workers took precautions to avoid interrupting the flow of traffic above ground and interfering with preexisting tunnels. The Fifth Avenue station opened in 1926, while the tunnel under Bryant Park to Times Square opened the following year. In January 1927, after the section of the Flushing Line under Bryant Park was complete, plans were announced for a restoration of the park's northern section.  1930s restoration  By the 1930s, Bryant Park was suffering from neglect and was considered disreputable, as the Sixth Avenue elevated literally overshadowed the park.: 236 Over a period of 10 years, about 100 separate plans for Bryant Park's renovation were proposed, but never enacted. In an attempt to revitalize the park, the George Washington Bicentennial Planning Committee and Sears filed plans for a replica of lower Manhattan's Federal Hall in early 1932. During the construction of the replica, part of the park was fenced off. The Dr. Marion Sims and Washington Irving statues were removed; the statues were later found under the Williamsburg Bridge. The replica was opened to the public in May 1932, charging an admission fee for entry. That November, Manhattan parks commissioner Walter R. Herrick formally notified Sears that the replica had to be torn down, because he did not approve of its proposed conversion into a Great Depression relief center. By the next year, the Bicentennial Committee's funds had been exhausted. The replica was torn down in mid 1933.In an attempt to engage unemployed architects, the Architects' Emergency Committee held a competition for the redesign of Bryant Park in 1933. The winning design was submitted by Lusby Simpson, of Queens.: 2 : 236 However, due to a lack of funding, the winning design was not implemented immediately. In February 1934, under the leadership of newly appointed parks commissioner Robert Moses, work was started on Simpson's plan. The renovated park featured a great lawn, as well as hedges and later an iron fence that separated the park from the surrounding city streets. Two entrances each were added from 40th and 42nd Streets.: 2 As part of the project, 270 trees were placed around the park. Moses also placed the park's statues along 40th and 42nd Streets so as to block sight lines from these streets. To save money, the project hired workers from the Civil Works Administration, an unemployment relief program. The renovation was complete by late 1934, and after a short postponement, the park reopened that September 15.: 2 Parts of the park were closed in the late 1930s due to transit changes on Sixth Avenue; the elevated was torn down in 1938, and the construction of the underground Sixth Avenue subway line occurred around the same time. The Sixth Avenue subway opened in 1940. A New Yorker article remarked in 1936 that during the prior 14 years, Bryant Park has been closed to the public ... for half that time.  Mid 20th century  Public events in Bryant Park were held through the mid 20th century. For instance, in 1944 during World War II, an aircraft demonstration was held in the park. Outdoor summer concerts in Bryant Park were started in 1948 by Philip Lieson Miller, a musicologist at the New York Public Library. These concerts took place from 12 to 2 pm on weekdays from July through September. On October 15, 1969, forty thousand people attended a rally in Bryant Park as part of the nationwide Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Another large event, the Big Apple Circus, was proposed to be held in Bryant Park in 1978, but parks commissioner Gordon Davis denied the circus permission to host a show there, since it would have closed off Bryant Park to the public.Plans to build parking garages under Bryant Park also surfaced in the mid 20th century, as a means of relieving parking shortages in Midtown Manhattan. The first such plan was made in 1946 when the city conducted a survey to determine the feasibility of such a garage. Parks commissioner Moses opposed the plan. A parking garage was proposed again in 1958, with plans for 1,200 spaces, though Moses also opposed this proposal. This proposal was backed by the Avenue of the Americas Association. However, though Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. supported the proposal, the New York City Planning Commission voted against it in November 1961.By the 1960s, Bryant Park had entered a state of deterioration, due to a lack of maintenance and its location in a business district with few nighttime activities. In an attempt to deter crime, new lighting was installed in Bryant Park in 1962. Nevertheless, in 1966, parks commissioner Thomas Hoving called a meeting to restore the park, noting its degraded condition. By the 1970s, Bryant Park had been taken over by drug dealers and the homeless, and was considered a no go area by ordinary citizens and visitors. The condition of the park was so bad that in 1973, parks commissioner Richard M. Clurman threatened to close Bryant Park and clear it of everybody until we can get together and make it a place that New Yorkers want it to be. After a man was murdered at the park in 1976, the New York Times noted that gambling and drinking were commonplace at the park. In an opinion piece in the New York Daily News, Jerome Gartner, a coordinator for the Bryant Park Steering Committee, stated that the mugging of a Union Carbide executive in Bryant Park had been quoted as a reason for the company's moving out of New York City.An initial attempt at cleanup was commenced by the Bryant Park Community Fund in the mid 1970s. Free concerts were added in the hope that it would keep out criminals. The initiative was largely unsuccessful, though, and its funding was nearly depleted by 1977. Another initiative, the Bryant Park Steering Committee, was created in 1977 as a partnership between local businesses and the City University of New York. More New York City Police Department officers were added, and District Attorney Robert Morgenthau agreed to process arrests in Bryant Park more quickly. By 1978, public perception of Bryant Park's safety was slightly better than in previous years, though drug dealers still frequented the park after office workers had gone back to work following their lunch breaks. Furthermore, NYPD officers initially declined to arrest drug users who were nonviolent. Starting in 1979, a coordinated program of amenities, including book and flower markets, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council. Though the Parks Council's activities became popular, drug use and small crimes were still common within the park through the early 1980s. After a group of undercover NYPD officers were stationed in the park starting in 1980, they had made 400 drug related arrests within six months.  Late 20th century to present   Formation of corporations  The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation was founded in 1980 by Dan Biederman, along with Andrew Heiskell, chairman of Time Inc. and the New York Public Library. The BPRC immediately brought significant changes to remake the park into a place that people wanted to visit, and instituted a rigorous program to clean the park, remove graffiti, and repair physical damage. The BPRC also created a private security staff to confront unlawful behavior. In addition, the BPRC started an outdoor concert series in the summers. By 1982, arrests had decreased significantly compared to two years prior.Another agency the Bryant Park Management Corporation, composed of several nearby businesses was tasked with maintaining the park, spending 525,000 per year to do so. NYC Parks spent an additional 250,000 a year on maintenance, the same amount as when the city had sole control over the park's management. In 1983, HBO's president, Frank Biondi, gave Heiskell a 100,000 check just before the company moved into new headquarters at 1100 Avenue of the Americas, adjacent to the park. At the time, that was the largest donation toward Bryant Park by a private corporation.  Renovation  In 1983, in an attempt to draw crowds to the park and raise money for continued maintenance, the BPRC proposed leasing Bryant Park from the city, renovating it, and building a caf in the park. The 18 million renovation was to be executed by an alliance between the BPRC, NYPL, and NYC Parks. Restaurateur Warner LeRoy was to operate the eatery, and he planned to build an 80 foot tall , 10,500 square foot glass caf on the park's east side adjacent to the library. In addition, the park would include four smaller food kiosks, a reflecting pool and water fountain, and a dedicated security team. In 1984, the state passed legislation to allow the BPRC to lease space for such an eatery. The City Planning Commission also approved the structure the following year. However, the proposed caf was met with opposition from the public, as it would obscure the library's rear facade. Several park advocates who opposed it argued that the proposed eatery would turn over part of a public park to a private entity. LeRoy withdrew from the project in 1986 due to this opposition, saying that he feared that the constant reviews of the plan would bring the proposed structure to mediocrity .The renovation was approved by the City Art Commission in January 1987, though the restaurant plan had not yet been approved. Following LeRoy's withdrawal from the proposed Bryant Park caf , the BPRC created a new plan with multiple smaller restaurant spaces. The spaces would be composed of two smaller pavilions, each 20 feet tall with an area of 5,250 square feet , flanking the Bryant memorial next to the library. In September 1987, the plans went to another vote before the City Art Commission, with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission taking an advisory role. The redesigned restaurant spaces were also approved by the City Art Commission that December, though the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission registered no official position on the matter. A concessionaire for one of the spaces was found in 1988, and the same year, the city turned over duties of Bryant Park's land to BPRC. Subsequently, the park redesign was drafted by Hanna Olin Ltd. and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates; the design preserved many elements of Simpson's design in the 1930s.: 236 The park was closed for renovations on July 11, 1988. The four year project to rebuild Bryant Park entailed new entrances, repairs to paths and lighting,: 237 238 and a redesign of the park's garden by Lynden Miller. Biederman worked with William H. Whyte, a sociologist whose influence led them to implement two decisions.: 237 238 One was the placement of 2,000 movable chairs in the park. The other was to lower the park itself, because Bryant Park had been elevated from the street and isolated by tall hedges prior to the 1988 redesign.: 237 238 The 1988 renovation lowered the park to nearly street level and tore out the hedges, though much of the park was still slightly elevated. The park's restrooms, which had been closed for 35 years, were renovated, as well. The BPRC also found that several of the sculptures would need to be repaired, and called on William Cullen Bryant's descendants and other entities to provide funding for the restoration of these sculptures. Landscape architect Laurie Olin of Hanna Olin recalls that the design process focused on the different abilities of people who use these spaces...as well as making spaces that people are comfortable being with each other in. The restoration cost 8.9 million, which included 5.7 million of city funding and 3.2 million of private funding.The renovation took place at the same time as the NYPL's expansion of the main branch's stacks underneath Bryant Park. The project was originally estimated to cost 21.6 million and was to be the largest expansion project in the main branch's history; it entailed building 84 miles of stacks, which could hold 3.2 million books. Construction on the stacks started after the park was closed. The park was excavated and the Great Lawn was rebuilt above it. Once the underground facilities were completed, Bryant Park was completely rebuilt, with 2.5 to 6 feet of earth between the park surface and the storage facility's ceiling.  Reopening and critical acclaim  Bryant Park was initially supposed to reopen in late 1990 or early 1991. The reopening date was pushed back due to delays caused by the construction of the library's stacks. In June 1991, the city and BPRC reached an agreement to reopen the western section of Bryant Park on summer weekdays. The park was soft reopened on April 21, 1992, with the official reopening set for nearly a month later.The new design received widespread acclaim. Deemed a triumph for many by New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger, the renovation was lauded not only for its architectural excellence, but also for adhering to Whyte's vision. According to Goldberger, Biederman understood that the problem of Bryant Park was its perception as an enclosure cut off from the city; he knew that, paradoxically, people feel safer when not cut off from the city, and that they feel safer in the kind of public space they think they have some control over. The renovation was lauded as The Best Example of Urban Renewal by New York magazine, and was described by Time as a small miracle .: 34 Many awards followed, including a Design Merit Award from Landscape Architecture Magazine,: 34 and the 1996 Award for Excellence from the Urban Land Institute . The park has been extolled for its relative calmness and cleanness. Even through the 21st century, Bryant Park remains a model of civic renewal that mayors of other cities, such as Jorge Elorza of Providence, Rhode Island, sometimes hold up as a model to emulate.Bryant Park was described in the media as an example of New York City's 1990s revival. A New York Times article in 1995 referred to the park as the Town Square of Midtown and an office oasis frequented by midtown office workers. Further improvements included the installation of two newsstands in 1992, one each at Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Open air concerts in the summers, which drew thousands of people, were commenced. To lessen infestations of pigeons eating the plants, the BPC started scattering corn kernels that contained the drug azacosterol, which resulted in many pigeons becoming infertile without any other side effects. Meanwhile, financing for a restaurant in Bryant Park next to the library was finally secured in 1993. The restaurant opened in 1995.  Subsequent developments  With security largely under the purview of the BPC, corporate control of the park has meant that Bryant Park received passive recreation amenities, while excluding active sports that might cater to a broader urban public. The BPC added a custom built carousel in 2002 and revived the tradition of an open air library, the Reading Room, in 2003. In July 2002, the park launched a public wireless network, making the park the first in New York City to formally offer free Wi Fi access to visitors. The Wi Fi system was subsequently upgraded in 2008. Furthermore, the Pond, a free admission ice skating rink, opened in the park in 2005. The park's public restrooms were renovated in 2006 and in 2017.The dramatic rise in real estate values in the area around Bryant Park, as well as new construction in adjacent areas, was a consequence of the park's improvements. By 1993, the surrounding region had become a highly desirable office area, and formerly vacant office space around the park was being filled quickly. By the first decade of the 21st century, nearby buildings and businesses were also using names that referred to the park. This was shown by the then new Bank of America Tower skyscraper at the park's northeast corner using the address One Bryant Park , as well as the growing trend of Bryant Park vanity addresses, including 3, 4, 5, and 7 Bryant Park. National Public Radio, located just south of the park, also named a now defunct talk show the Bryant Park Project upon the show's 2007 launch. Such enthusiasm to use the Bryant Park name would have been nonexistent in the 1980s, when the area was described as the Wild West .New real estate developments were also built in the park's vicinity starting in the 21st century, which together added over 13,000 new workers to the area immediately surrounding Bryant Park. These included the Bank of America Tower; an expansion to 1095 Avenue of the Americas immediately to the south; Eleven Times Square a block west of Bryant Park; and 505 Fifth Avenue at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Several hotels were also built, including a conversion of 485 Fifth Avenue at 41st Street, a Residence Inn by Marriott at Sixth Avenue and 39th Street. By the early 2010s, investors were purchasing buildings around Bryant Park south of 42nd Street as part of a small real estate boom. Rents per square foot in buildings south of 42nd Street had historically been lower than rents in buildings north of 42nd Street. Conversely, 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 452 Fifth Avenue were able to attract comparatively high rental rates despite both being south of 42nd Street. Later in the decade, the area around Bryant Park started growing into a residential neighborhood, with the construction of new developments in the area. Within a two block radius of the park, or roughly 500 feet , units routinely sold for millions of dollars.  Description Bryant Park is located between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 40th and 42nd Street, and covers 9.6 acres . Although technically the main branch of the New York Public Library is located within the park, in design it forms the eastern boundary of the park's green space, making Sixth Avenue the park's primary entrance. Bryant Park is used mostly as a passive recreation space, and lacks active sports facilities. Bryant Park is several steps above the surrounding streets, enclosed by a retaining wall. Granite stairs at several locations provide access from the surrounding sidewalks.: 2 The surrounding area contains numerous structures, including the Bank of America Tower and 1095 Avenue of the Americas to the northwest;: 270 271 the Bryant Park Studios, American Radiator Building, Engineers' Club Building, and 452 Fifth Avenue to the south;: 268 270 461 Fifth Avenue and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library to the southeast;: 269 and 500 Fifth Avenue, the Aeolian Building, and the W.R. Grace Building to the north.: 271 One of the park's largest features is a large lawn located slightly below the level of the surrounding walkways.: 2 Besides serving as a lunchroom for office workers, the lawn serves as the seating area for some of the park's major events, such as Bryant Park Movie Nights, Broadway in Bryant Park, and Square Dance. The lawn's season runs from February until October, when it is closed to make way for Bank of America Winter Village.Numerous walkways surround the central lawn. The northern and southern sides are each flanked by two flagstone walkways. Each of these walkways is bordered by London plane trees , which contribute to the park's European feel. In addition, numerous statues are scattered throughout the park.: 2 A raised terrace on the eastern side of the lawn, which dates to the construction of the library's main branch, is paved with gray flagstones and red brick. Its centerpiece is the William Cullen Bryant Memorial, which is raised on a pedestal of its own.: 4 A restroom structure is located at the northern border of the park along 42nd Street. A carousel, installed in 2002, is located at the park's southern border. The park is served by the New York City Subway's 7, 7 , B, D, F, F , and M trains at 42nd Street Bryant Park Fifth Avenue station, entrances to which are located on the northern and western borders of the park, as well as MTA Regional Bus Operations' M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M42, M55 and Q32 routes.  Art and monuments   Sculptures  Notable sculptures in the park include or have included: Statue of William E. Dodge , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's northern border Statue of J. Marion Sims , removed in the 1930s Washington Irving , removed in the 1930s William Cullen Bryant Memorial , a standing figure located on a canopied pedestal at the park's eastern border Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain , located at the park's western border; the fountain collects about 3,000 to 4,000 in coins each year, from dozens of countries Bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , a bust located at the park's southern border Statue of Jos Bonif cio de Andrada , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's southwestern corner Statue of Gertrude Stein , a sitting figure located at the park's southeastern corner Statue of Benito Ju rez , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's northwestern corner  Other memorials  The northwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, contains the Heiskell Plaza, a stairway and entrance plaza paved with flagstones. It was placed in 1993 in honor of Andrew Heiskell, a cofounder of the BPC.The southwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 40th Street, is known as Nikola Tesla Corner. Tesla, an inventor, lived in the nearby New Yorker Hotel in his later years, and would feed pigeons in the park. The placement of the sign was due to the efforts of the Croatian Club of New York in cooperation with New York City officials, and Dr. Ljubo Vujovic of the Tesla Memorial Society of New York.  Carousel  Bryant Park contains a carousel called Le Carrousel Magique, located in the southern section of the park. The carousel was designed by Marvin Sylvor, created by the Fabricon Carousel Company, and installed in 2002. The company was selected after a carousel installation in Bryant Park was approved in 1997. The carousel has a diameter of 22 feet , weighs 12,000 pounds , and contains 14 animal casts, of which 12 are capable of moving vertically. In keeping with the French theme of the park, it plays French music. It underwent a restoration in 2009. The carousel also has a ticket booth, measuring 7 feet tall and 4 feet wide, which was constructed in 1928 and was relocated from Paragon Park in Hull, Massachusetts.  Restrooms  Bryant Park contains a Beaux Arts granite restroom structure on the northern border, along 42nd Street. There are two facilities, one for men and women, both of which are 315 square feet . These were built in 1911 along with the NYPL Main Branch, but due to the park's landmark status, they cannot be expanded. The exterior of each building contains a frieze with garland motifs.: 5 After being closed in the mid 1960s, they were restored by Kupiec Koutsomitis and reopened in 1992. The restrooms have been described as being among the city's best. A subsequent renovation in 2006 solidified their status as, in the words of then New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, the gold standard for park comfort stations. The restrooms were renovated again in 2017. Following the 2017 renovation, the restrooms contained rotating artworks selected from a collection of 225 works, as well as fresh flowers, classical music, attendants, and automatic toilets and faucets.  Reading room  The original Reading Room was founded in August 1935 to entertain unemployed workers during the Great Depression. Started as an initiative by the New York Public Library, the Reading Room provided the jobless with a place to interact and share ideas without having to pay money or show identification. Despite this, the library was well used, being used by 50,000 people by its first anniversary. Theft was low, with only 34 publications being lost in the library's first year. By its third year, 400 books and 1,000 magazines were in circulation and were being perused by 70,000 people per year. Books from the NYPL, and donations of magazines and trade publications from publishers, contributed to the success of the open air library. The tradition of Reading Rooms halted in 1944 due to a staff shortage during World War II.The Reading Room tradition was revived in 2003 with HSBC as its first sponsor. Oxford University Press, Scholastic Corporation, Mitchell's NY, Cond Nast Publications, Time Inc., Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., and Rodale, Inc. were among the companies who donated books and publications. In addition to the complimentary reading materials, in 2004 programming was added to Reading Room's content. The Reading Room features readings and book sales by contemporary writers and poets, plus book related special events such as book clubs, writers workshops and storytelling for kids.  Bank of America Winter Village  Modeled on Europe's Christkindlmarkt, in 2002 Bryant Park introduced the Holiday Shops in an effort to liven up the park space during the winter. Initially slow to gain traction, the Holiday Shops became a fixture of the Manhattan holiday scene in 2005 by expanding into an all encompassing seasonal destination with the addition of New York's only free admission ice skating rink. The Shops also include a Norway Spruce tree, as well as a standalone dining and event space.Sponsored by Bank of America, Winter Village can be set up within two weeks. It has transformed the park into a year round destination. In September 2016, Bryant Park Corporation announced market makers Urbanspace as the new operator for the Holiday Shops, which grew from 80 boutiques in 2002 to over 170 in 2018. In 2018, Urbanspace also took over management of the rinkside eatery, rebranding it as The Lodge.  Private operation  The Bryant Park Corporation , formerly the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation , manages the park. BPC also oversees the Bryant Park Management Corporation , which was created to manage the Bryant Park business improvement district.Although Bryant Park is a public park, BPC accepts no public funds. It was initially supported by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but now receives funding through tax assessments on surrounding property within the business improvement district, fees from concessionaires, and revenues generated by public events. To acquire accurate data about park usage, BPC counts the number of patrons in Bryant Park twice per day, at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. The number of events at the park grew significantly after its reopening, causing some consternation by people who feared that the park would be dominated by private entities, thus would be inaccessible to the public. As a result, BPC makes most events free and open to the public. One exception was the New York Fashion Week shows that formerly took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. BPC cofounder Dan Biederman often publicly expressed his frustration that the fashion shows were not under BPC's control. They pay us a million dollars. It's a million dollars I would happily do without, he told the Los Angeles Times. BPC was particularly frustrated that the fashion shows dominated the park during two crucial times: in late summer, when the weather is perfect for park visitors; and in early February, necessitating the early closure of the park's popular free admission ice skating rink.  Programming Numerous events are hosted on the lawn at Bryant Park. Bryant Park Movie Nights, begun in the early 1990s, take place on Monday evenings during the summer. Various free musical performances are sponsored by corporations during months with warm weather, including Broadway in Bryant Park, sponsored by iHeartMedia and featuring performers from current Broadway musicals, integrated with content provided by event sponsors.The park has various activity areas open all day long, including board games, chess and backgammon, a putting green and Kubb area, an Art Cart, ping pong tables, and Petanque courts. The parks also offer free classes in juggling, yoga, tai chi, and knitting. In the 40th Street plaza of the park, there is a station called Bryant Park Games where visitors can borrow an array of games, including Chinese chess and quoits. In addition, chess and table tennis can also be played at Bryant Park.Food and drink are served at four park operated concessionary kiosks. There are two additional kiosks on Fifth Avenue, bringing the total of concessionaires near Bryant Park to six.  Former programming  Formerly, Bryant Park hosted New York Fashion Week shows, which took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. NYFW, which moved to Bryant Park in 1993, was forced to set fees for its shows after Manhattan Community Board 5 disapproved of a free fashion show on the grounds that three fourths of profits would go to BPC and only one fourth to NYC Parks. Dan Biederman of the BPC had called the profits from NYFW a million dollars I would happily do without, and lamented the fact that NYFW took over the park at two high traffic periods: late summer and late winter. NYFW moved from Bryant Park in 2010 after disagreements with the BPC.  Landmark designations Bryant Park and the New York Public Library Main Branch were jointly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Its listing on the NRHP is distinct from the New York Public Library on the same day, which covered just the main branch building. In addition, in 1974, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the park as an official scenic landmark.

            "text": "A cable protection system protects subsea power cables against various factors that could reduce the cable's lifetime, when entering an offshore structure. When a subsea power cable is laid, there is an area where the cable can be subjected to increased dynamic forces the cable is not necessarily designed to withstand over its lifetime. Cable protection systems allow the specification, and thus cost, of a subsea power cable to be reduced by removing the need for additional armoring. Cables can be produced more cheaply, whilst still providing the 20 plus year lifetime required. Offshore windfarm developers have widely adopted cable protection systems due to the dynamic areas where the cable leaves from the seabed and enters the monopile J tube, in part due to the potential for localised scouring to occur near the structure. A CPS generally consists of three sections: a Centraliser or Monopile interface, a protection system for the dynamic area, and a protection system for the static area. The installation of J Tubes for offshore renewable monopiles was viewed as a costly approach, and a 'latching' type of cable protection system which penetrates the outer wall of the monopile, via a specifically designed angled aperture enables the simplification of monopile design, and removes the need for additional works post pile driving which usually involved the use of divers. This approach has become an industry standard in monopile design, assisting developers to reduce their costs for construction.  History Articulated half pipe Cable protections systems have traditionally been used for the protection of cables at shore landings, and other areas where cable damage could be envisaged, and burial was not practical. Patents for variations of articulated pipe cable protections date back to 1929. The system was described as a cable armor shield adapted to protect the cable from damage and wear occasioned by rubbing on rocks, contacting with ships, anchors or other objects, and has for its object to provide a practical flexible armor shield of this class which can be readily applied to the cable at any point along its length. From their outset cable protection systems were designed to be simple, effective, and easy to assemble. The systems consisted of a series of half shells which had a convex flange at one end and a larger socket flange at the other allowing the sections to form a flexible universal joint connection between them. Due to the intended use of heavy cast or forged metals they also had the added advantage of increasing the weight of the cable being installed, thus reducing movement on the seabed. Over the years innovations have occurred improving the articulation of the joints with modern articulated pipes being more akin to ball joints, and some manufacturers providing 'boltless' articulated pipes, thus saving assembly time.Changes in the metallurgy have also happened, leading to most half shell articulated pipe now being made from ductile iron, due to its improved strength and elasticity characteristics.Today these articulated pipes are also utilised for their bend restriction properties, allowing them to be utilised as bend restrictors for the protected cable.  Design considerations Cable protection systems are predominantly designed to protect the system from damage throughout the lifetime of the cable caused by fatigue, overbending of the cable, and to provide protection of the cable until it reaches an area of burial.  Design life  The cable protection system will be designed to provide protection for a specific lifetime, the 'design life' of the system, which may vary dependent upon the conditions encountered.  Overbending of cable  Overbending of the cable occurs when the cable is bent in a radius of less than the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Although the cable may initially survive the overbending, this can lead to subsequent fatigue within the cable ultimately leading to cable failure. The CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius.  Fatigue of CPS cable within  Subsea cable protection systems can encounter wear due to movement, and general changes in composition due to being submerged for a prolonged period of time, such as corrosion or changes in polymer based compounds. Consideration should be given to the induced effects on the CPS resulting from the dynamic elements in the environment. Simple changes such as changes in temperature, current or salinity can result in changes in the ability of the CPS to offer protection for the life of the cable. It is advisable to carefully assess the potential effects of movement of the CPS, relating to the dynamic abilities of the cable. The CPS may withstand the worst conditions seen over a 100yr period, but would the cable inside the CPS survive these movements. In some instances, such as shore ends for fibre optic cables where rocky outcrops are present, dynamic influences can be reduced by securing the articulated pipe to the seabed rock, thus reducing the degree of movement remaining. Some manufacturers have performed independent empirical testing, utilising the DMZC facility at the university of Exeter in the UK, to provide a simulated 25yr life cycle of the dynamic forces applicable to their product in order to provide customers with improved confidence in the survivability of the system.Another cause for failure of subsea power cables is caused by overheating, which can occur where a cable is contained within a CPS without adequate ability to dissipate the heat produced by the cable. These lead to early fatigue of the cable insulation, necessitating the replacement of the cable. Subsea cable incidents account for around 77 of the total global cost of wind farm losses. Since 2007 this percentage, which has varied between 70 and 80 , is statistically reported year after year.  Seabed stability  Seabed stability is an important factor associated with cable protection systems. Should the cable protection system be too buoyant, it is less likely to remain in contact with the seabed, thus the CPS is more likely to require additional remedial stability measures, such as installation of concrete mattresses, rockbags, or rockdumping.  Suspension strength  When a CPS is being installed to interface with a monopile structure, there is likely to be seabed scouring to some degree. Should the scouring become excessive, the CPS may be suspended within a scour hole, and needs to be capable of supporting its own weight, and that of the cable within. Failure to sustain this loading scenario will lead to failure of the CPS, which will in turn allow the forces to act upon the cable within, ultimately leading to cable damage.  Installation  Within the renewables market in particular, installation of CPS's are preferred to be completely diverless, as this reduces the developers cost, and removes risk to human life through diving in a hazardous area.  Removal Reinstallation  A final consideration for CPS is that of removal of the cable should a failure occur. Some designs require diver intervention to recover the cable with the CPS. Due consideration should also be given to the removal of a CPS should the CPS itself fail. The costs associated with CPS replacement during the operational lifetime of an offshore wind farm are not insignificant, as the cable will most likely require repair replacement as part of the process.  Bend restrictors Various innovative systems have been developed to provide restriction of bending, including ductile iron articulated pipe, and polymer or metal based vertebrae systems. Vertebrae bend restrictors are available in both metal and polymer based forms. Some cable protection systems include a polymer based vertebrae system which restricts the bend radius to a maximum of a few degrees per segment. These systems are lighter than their metal equivalents and often more expensive to produce but must be carefully assessed for longevity in the proposed application. Due to the use of polymers these systems tend to be of a larger diameter than their metal counterparts, which presents a larger surface area for drag induced forces caused by currents.  Bend stiffeners Bend stiffeners are conically shaped polymer mouldings designed to add local stiffness to the product contained within, limiting bending stresses and curvature to acceptable levels. Bend stiffeners are generally suitable for water depths of 35 metres or less, and their suitability is highly dependent on currents and seabed conditions at site. Extreme care must be taken when selecting a stiffener, especially relating to the lifespan of the system as these themselves can become fatigued fragile. As the stiffness of these products are dependent upon the nature of the plastic used, careful testing and QA of plastics should be carefully considered as flaws introduced during material manufacture, processing, machining and molding.  Other systems Various other polymer based systems have been developed which provide a flexible 'tube' which can be attached to the structure in advance of the cable being installed, although these are relatively new to the industry, and considered by some as unproven.  Applicable Standards Although there are no specific standards for cable protections systems, DNVGL RP 0360 Subsea power cables in shallow water includes a section on Cable Protection at the interface to a structure .  Offshore Wind CPS Issues The use of CPS systems to protect offshore wind power cables has suffered from various CPS failures, resulting in costly repair of CPS systems and the power cables they were to protect. The exact extent, cost and frequency of occurrence of these failures is generally not disclosed, however there have been exceptions including announcements from developer operator companies such as Orsted of the extent and anticipated repair costs of these.

            "text": "Camille Papin Tissot was a French naval officer and pioneer of wireless telegraphy who established the first French operational radio connections at sea.  Life Camille Papin Tissot was the second child of Pierre Tissot and Adeline Alexandrine G rardin, born on 15 October 1868. Their third child, Esther Ad le Tissot, was born on 1 April 1872. The two surviving children, Camille and Esther, were primarily raised by their mother, as their father was often at sea. Recommended by his father, Camille Tissot entered the naval college at Brest in 1884 when he was 16 years old. He studied navigation on the school ship Le Borda until 1886, and was then posted to the port of Brest. In the first years of his career in the navy, he was successively posted to various school ships and warships, finally to the cruiser Coetlogon . He then turned to shore duty as of 23 January 1891. He agreed to temporarily occupy one of the teaching positions in physics and chemistry of the naval school. He stayed on for 21 years as a professor in cole Navale. The passion of sciences having been transmitted to him by his father, he obtained the degree of Bachelor of the Physical sciences. It was as a professor in cole Navale that he became devoted to the study of the electric oscillations and their application in the maritime field. Tissot acquired ranks during his various assignments: 1 August 1886: Aspirant of second class 5 October 1887: Aspirant of first class 5 October 1889: Enseigne de vaisseau 22 August 1896: Lieutenant de vaisseau 19 April 1912: Capitaine de fr gateThis last promotion was exceptional for a sailor who practically never sailed. It was due to the importance of the work undertaken by Tissot for the Navy. In 1894, Camille Tissot met and married Jeanne Emma Stapfer, a 20 year old woman of an Alsacienne family who moved to Brest in 1870. He nominally converted to the Catholic religion at the request of his father in law, although his own beliefs were socialist and atheist. Among the guests at his wedding were Albert Turpain and Marcel Cachin, very committed members of Parliament and future founder of French Communist Party in 1920. They had one daughter, Camille.  Work  In 1896, when the work of Lodge and of Marconi concerning wireless telegraphy was still little known, Tissot undertook parallel and independent research. He built apparatus for radio experiments with the assistance of E. Branly and of the manufacturer Eugene Ducretet for whom later he will develop apparatus. On 3 August 1898, Tissot demonstrates the first French operational radio connection at sea, covering 800 meters between BORDERED and an on shore semaphore station. Convinced, the Minister of Marine on 6 August agrees to finance purchase of material to allow him to continue his tests. With this apparatus Camille Tissot in 1899 organized a large trial run and demonstrates communications by radio, initially between various points of the roads of Brest and the Saint Martin church, then to the islands Vierge and Stiff . In 1898 he also established radio contact to the island of Ouessant. This station will become Ushant radio station, with call sign FFU , which is active there until 1943. In 1899, Tissot published a report describing his work and experiments through the roads of Brest. In 1900, Tissot equipped the French Navy with its first radio apparatus.In 1902, the station Ushant TSF is established with a radio operator, receiver with coherer, and an arc transmitter. This station had a radio telegraphy range of 80 kilometers with a fleet of 14 ships at sea and with Brest. In 1904 the Ouessant radio station with call sign FFU carried out radiotelegraphic connections on 600 meters with a fleet of passenger ships. From 1905, Tissot made very thorough studies on the detection of radio signals. Following these tests, Tissot showed the possibility of using radio to transmit a time signal and to regulate the chronometers of the ships at sea. The Bureau des Longitudes started daily time signal service starting in May 1910. In 1907, Tissot conceived, with F Pellin, a Crystal radio without tiresome adjustment to receive signals aboard ships. In 1911, his technical expertise was required by a committee of French industrialists carried out by E Girardeau, during the series of lawsuits between the Marconi Company and French radio companies. With the occasion of these lawsuits, Tissot and F rri in particular sought to show certain faults of patent 77777 of Marconi, but also the priority of experiments of certain French scientists, like Eugene Ducretet. Marconi won the lawsuit, but the decision of the court, which gave the Marconi the right to replace the French material by material made by Marconi, will never be applied in France. During the First World War, Tissot made several stays at Bizerte, to equip ships with radio and to work on detection of underwater sound. Commander Tissot died in October 1917 of pulmonary tuberculosis and influenza. He was buried in the military square of the cemetery of Arcachon. He was an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and Officer of the State education.  Publications  He wrote three detailed works: M moire de th se de Doctorat sur la r sonance des antennes . Memory of thesis of Doctorate on the resonance of the antennas. Trait sur les oscillations lectriques Treaty on the electric oscillations. Manuel de TSF th orique et pratique , Handbook of theoretical and practical TSF , republished until 1932 . books written by Camille Tissot.He was also the author of many articles of popularization of radio in international scientific reviews, and gave very many conferences on the subject. Although not a member, he intervened regularly in front of the Academy of the Sciences. He received several prizes and rewards of the Academy.

            "text": "Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss ; Latin: Carolus Fridericus Gauss; 30 April 1777 23 February 1855 was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in mathematics and science. Sometimes referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum and the greatest mathematician since antiquity , Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields of mathematics and science, and is ranked among history's most influential mathematicians.  Biography   Early years  Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick , in the Duchy of Brunswick Wolfenb ttel , to poor, working class parents. His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the Feast of the Ascension . Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years. He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended as a child.Gauss was a child prodigy. In his memorial on Gauss, Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen wrote that when Gauss was barely three years old he corrected a math error his father made; and that when he was seven, solved an arithmetic series problem faster than anyone else in his class of 100 pupils. There are many versions of this story, with various details regarding the nature of the series the most frequent being the classical problem of adding together all the integers from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first groundbreaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed his magnum opus, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, in 1798, at the age of 21, and it was published in 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day. Gauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the Duke of Brunswick, who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum , which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the University of G ttingen from 1795 to 1798. While at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems. His breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that a regular polygon can be constructed by compass and straightedge if the number of its sides is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a power of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career. Gauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular heptadecagon be inscribed on his tombstone. The stonemason declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.The year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March. He further advanced modular arithmetic, greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the quadratic reciprocity law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The prime number theorem, conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the prime numbers are distributed among the integers. Gauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three triangular numbers on 10 July and then jotted down in his diary the note:  ! num    . On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which 150 years later led to the Weil conjectures.  Later years and death  Gauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while having gout and suffering general unhappiness. For example, at the age of 62, he taught himself Russian.In 1840, Gauss published his influential Dioptrische Untersuchungen, in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a paraxial approximation . Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its cardinal points and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.In 1845, he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.In 1854, Gauss selected the topic for Bernhard Riemann's inaugural lecture ber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen . On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1853. On 23 February 1855, Gauss died of a heart attack in G ttingen ; he is interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Two people gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son in law Heinrich Ewald, and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. Gauss's brain was preserved and was studied by Rudolf Wagner, who found its mass to be slightly above average, at 1,492 grams , and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimetres . Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation of his genius.  Religious views  Gauss was nominally a member of the St. Albans Evangelical Lutheran church in G ttingen. One of his biographers, G. Waldo Dunnington, has described Gauss's religious views as follows: For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength, it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life, it brought him confidence. Gauss's God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report the truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research. Apart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss's personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with B hler and others considering him a deist with very unorthodox views, while Dunnington points out that he was, at least, a nominal Lutheran. In connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between Rudolf Wagner and Gauss, in which they discussed William Whewell's book Of the Plurality of Worlds. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he envied those who were able to easily believe. This later led them to discuss the topic of faith, and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister Paul Gerhardt than by Moses. Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, Johann Peter S ssmilch, and the New Testament. Two religious works which Gauss read frequently were Braubach's Seelenlehre and S ssmilch's Gottliche ; he also devoted considerable time to the New Testament in the original Greek. Dunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing: Gauss's religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all. Gauss believed in an omniscient source of creation however he claimed that belief or a lack of it did not affect his mathematics.Though he was not a church goer, Gauss strongly upheld religious tolerance, believing that one is not justified in disturbing another's religious belief, in which they find consolation for earthly sorrows in time of trouble. When his son Eugene announced that he wanted to become a Christian missionary, Gauss approved of this, saying that regardless of the problems within religious organizations, missionary work was a highly honorable task.  Family  On 9 October 1805, Gauss married Johanna Osthoff , and had two sons and a daughter with her. Johanna died on 11 October 1809, and her youngest child, Louis, died the following year. Gauss plunged into a depression from which he never fully recovered. He then married Minna Waldeck on 4 August 1810, and had three more children. Gauss was never quite the same without his first wife, and just like his father, grew to dominate his children. Minna Waldeck died on 12 September 1831.Gauss had six children. With Johanna , his children were Joseph , Wilhelmina and Louis . With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene , Wilhelm and Therese . Eugene shared a good measure of Gauss's talent in languages and computation. After his second wife's death in 1831 Therese took over the household and cared for Gauss for the rest of his life. His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.Gauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for fear of lowering the family name , as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements. Gauss wanted Eugene to become a lawyer, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, for which Gauss refused to pay. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to Missouri and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in St. Louis. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein on 3 September 1912.  Personality  Gauss was an ardent perfectionist and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto pauca sed matura . His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Scottish American mathematician and writer Eric Temple Bell said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.Though he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in Berlin in 1828. Several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them Richard Dedekind and Bernhard Riemann. On Gauss's recommendation, Friedrich Bessel was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from G ttingen in March 1811. Around that time, the two men engaged in a correspondence. However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are unknown.Before she died, Sophie Germain was recommended by Gauss to receive an honorary degree; she never received it.Gauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs he preferred them to appear out of thin air and erased all traces of how he discovered them. This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, where he states that all analysis must be suppressed for sake of brevity. Gauss supported the monarchy and opposed Napoleon, whom he saw as an outgrowth of revolution. Gauss summarized his views on the pursuit of knowledge in a letter to Farkas Bolyai dated 2 September 1808 as follows: It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.  Career and achievements   Algebra  In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree, Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non constant single variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the Jordan curve theorem. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way. Gauss also made important contributions to number theory with his 1801 book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , which, among other things, introduced the triple bar symbol for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of modular arithmetic, contained the first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, developed the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms, stated the class number problem for them, and showed that a regular heptadecagon can be constructed with straightedge and compass. It appears that Gauss already knew the class number formula in 1801.In addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems: Fermat polygonal number theorem for n 3 Fermat's Last Theorem for n 5 Descartes's rule of signs Kepler conjecture for regular arrangementsHe also explained the pentagramma mirificum developed an algorithm for determining the date of Easter invented the Cooley Tukey FFT algorithm for calculating the discrete Fourier transforms 160 years before Cooley and Tukey  Astronomy  On 1 January 1801, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres. Piazzi could track Ceres for only somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data three degrees represent less than 1 of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801 just about a year after its first sighting and this turned out to be accurate within a half degree when it was rediscovered by Franz Xaver von Zach on 31 December at Gotha, and one day later by Heinrich Olbers in Bremen. This confirmation eventually led to the classification of Ceres as minor planet designation 1 Ceres: the first asteroid ever discovered.Gauss's method involved determining a conic section in space, given one focus and the conic's intersection with three given lines and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines . This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.One such method was the fast Fourier transform. While this method is attributed to a 1965 paper by James Cooley and John Tukey, Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper, Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata, was published only posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates the first presentation by Joseph Fourier on the subject in 1807.Zach noted that without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again . Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical observatory in G ttingen, a post he held for the remainder of his life. The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum . In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation. It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant, and contained an influential treatment of the method of least squares, a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of measurement error. Gauss proved the method under the assumption of normally distributed errors . The method had been described earlier by Adrien Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795. In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.  Geodetic survey  In 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover , linking up with previous Danish surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the heliotrope, an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions. In 1828, when studying differences in latitude, Gauss first defined a physical approximation for the figure of the Earth as the surface everywhere perpendicular to the direction of gravity , later called the geoid.  Non Euclidean geometries  Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of non Euclidean geometries but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non contradictory. Research on these geometries led to, among other things, Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non Euclidean. His friend Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai with whom Gauss had sworn brotherhood and the banner of truth as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry. Bolyai's son, J nos Bolyai, discovered non Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work ... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty five years. This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was stealing his idea.Letters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. Waldo Dunnington, a biographer of Gauss, argues in Gauss, Titan of Science that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non Euclidean geometry long before it was published by Bolyai, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.  Theorema Egregium  The geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade, fueled Gauss's interest in differential geometry and topology, fields of mathematics dealing with curves and surfaces. Among other things, he came up with the notion of Gaussian curvature. This led in 1828 to an important theorem, the Theorema Egregium , establishing an important property of the notion of curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface. That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3 dimensional space or 2 dimensional space. In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Gauss was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.  Magnetism  In 1831, Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber, leading to new knowledge in magnetism and the discovery of Kirchhoff's circuit laws in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake law. They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in G ttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the Magnetischer Verein , which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer sources of Earth's magnetic field.  Appraisal The British mathematician Henry John Stephen Smith gave the following appraisal of Gauss: If we except the great name of Newton it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied. It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty. Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of Euler's, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss's claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.  Anecdotes There are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.Another story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. B ttner, gave him a task: add a list of integers in arithmetic progression; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant Martin Bartels. Gauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1 100 101, 2 99 101, 3 98 101, and so on, for a total sum of 50 101 5050. However, the details of the story are at best uncertain , and some authors, such as Joseph J. Rotman in his book A First Course in Abstract Algebra , question whether it ever happened.He referred to mathematics as the queen of sciences and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first class mathematician.  Commemorations  From 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a normal distribution curve and some prominent G ttingen buildings were featured on the German ten mark banknote. The reverse featured the approach for Hanover. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss. One appeared in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two others, nos. 1246 and 1811, in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth. Daniel Kehlmann's 2005 novel Die Vermessung der Welt, translated into English as Measuring the World , explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting them with those of the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt. A film version directed by Detlev Buck was released in 2012.In 2007 a bust of Gauss was placed in the Walhalla temple.The numerous things named in honor of Gauss include: the normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, the most common bell curve in statistics; the Gauss Prize, one of the highest honors in mathematics; Gaussian units, the most common of the several electromagnetic unit systems based on CGS units. gauss, CGS unit for magnetic field.In 1929 the Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski, who helped to solve the German Enigma cipher machine in December 1932, began studying actuarial statistics at G ttingen. At the request of his Pozna University professor, Zdzis aw Krygowski, on arriving at G ttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.On 30 April 2018, Google honored Gauss on his would be 241st birthday with a Google Doodle showcased in Europe, Russia, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, parts of Southern and Central America and the United States.Carl Friedrich Gauss, who also introduced the so called Gaussian logarithms, sometimes gets confused with Friedrich Gustav Gauss , a German geologist, who also published some well known logarithm tables used up into the early 1980s.

            "text": "The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. It is at 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, between West 110th Street and West 113th Street. The cathedral is an unfinished building, with only two thirds of the proposed building completed, due to several major stylistic changes and work interruptions. The original design, in the Byzantine Revival and Romanesque Revival styles, began construction in 1892. After the opening of the crossing in 1909, the overall plan was changed to a Gothic Revival design. The completion of the nave was delayed until 1941 due to various funding shortfalls, and little progress has occurred since then, except for an addition to the tower at the nave's southwest corner. After a large fire damaged part of the cathedral in 2001, it was renovated and rededicated in 2008. The towers above the western elevation of the facade, as well as the southern transept and a proposed steeple above the crossing, have not been completed. Despite being incomplete, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine is the world's sixth largest church by area and either the largest or second largest Anglican cathedral. The floor area of St. John's is 121,000 sq ft , spanning a length of 601 feet , while the roof height of the nave is 177 feet . Since the cathedral's interior is so large, it has been used for hundreds of events and art exhibitions. In addition, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has been involved in various advocacy initiatives throughout its history. The cathedral close includes numerous buildings: the Leake Watts Orphan Asylum Building, the cathedral proper, the St. Faith's House, the Choir School, the Deanery, and the Bishop's House. The buildings are designed in several different styles and were built over prolonged periods of construction, with the Leake Watts Orphan Asylum predating the cathedral itself. The cathedral close was collectively designated an official city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2017.  History   Context   Site  The neighborhood of Morningside Heights was thinly settled in the 17th century by the Dutch, then by the British. It remained rural through the mid 19th century, with two exceptions. The first was the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, no longer extant, which opened on the site of the Columbia University campus near 116th Street in 1821. The other was Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum, bounded by 110th Street to the south and 113th Street to the north, which later became the current cathedral site. The Leake and Watts asylum was incorporated in 1831 under act of the New York State Legislature, and three years later, 25 acres land at the corner of Bloomingdale Road and 110th Street was purchased from the Bloomingdale Asylum. The initial plans for the asylum were drawn up by Ithiel Town, but were revised several times to keep the costs within the asylum's budget. The cornerstone of the asylum was laid in 1838, and it was completed in 1843.  Need for a cathedral  Meanwhile, the Episcopal Diocese of New York started to grow in the early 19th century: there were 26 Episcopal parishes in the city by 1800, and a decade later, that number had nearly doubled to 50. In 1828, the first proposal for a grand cathedral for the diocese was made by Bishop John Henry Hobart, who proposed a site near Washington Square Park. The church would be called the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, or St. John's Cathedral for short, after the Revelation by John of Patmos . The plans were canceled because of objections over erecting such a large building for the diocese, a derivative of the Church of England, even as many New Yorkers still harbored resentment over the American Revolutionary War.In 1873, a cathedral board of trustees was established under Bishop Horatio Potter. The board decided on property just south of Central Park, bounded by 59th Street to the north and 57th Street to the south. However, the purchase was canceled after the would be donors lost their savings in the Panic of 1873. Yet another plot of land, at Eighth Avenue and 74th Street, was offered to the church in 1882, but rejected due to the high cost of acquisition. By 1890, there were 40,000 Episcopalians in Manhattan, and Episcopalians made up the largest bloc of Protestants in the borough. Furthermore, many imposing institutions were being built in New York City, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall, Metropolitan Opera House, and the American Museum of Natural History.  Planning   Site selection  When Henry C. Potter, Horatio Potter's nephew, became the Diocese of New York's assistant bishop in 1883, he convened the trustees to look for an alternate site. On June 1, 1887, Henry Potter publicly announced his intention to build St. John's, though the exact location was still to be determined. Potter described the planned cathedral as an American Westminster Abbey that would rival the Catholic St. Patrick's Cathedral in Midtown Manhattan. In his announcement, Potter called on New Yorkers to give funds toward the new cathedral, which was expected to cost 10 million. The plans for the cathedral were well received by both Protestants and non Protestants, as well as the media and other denominational leaders. The donors included the wealthy Astor, Vanderbilt, and Belmont families. Additionally, the Barberini family's tapestries were gifted to the cathedral in 1891.Numerous sites in Manhattan were examined for the new cathedral's location, and by 1889, the Leake and Watts Asylum between 110th and 113th Streets had been chosen as the site for the future site of St. John's. News media such as The New York Times and Uptown Visitor praised the decision, as the site was located on a high point overlooking Central and Morningside Parks. The committee had wanted to build slightly further north, on a more elevated plot between 116th Street to the south and 119th Street to the north. However, that plot would be too difficult to acquire, as ownership of that tract was divided among several entities; by contrast, the Leake and Watts Asylum had full control over their entire city block. The 11.5 acre asylum site was deeded to the cathedral in October 1891, and the asylum moved to Westchester County, New York. The asylum site was then acquired for 850,000. At the time, Morningside Heights was quickly being developed as a residential neighborhood surrounded by numerous higher education institutions. The proposed cathedral's elevated location would have been visible from New Jersey, across the Hudson River to the west, as well as from the New York Bay to the south.  Architecture competition  Simultaneously, there was also debate over the new cathedral's style; because of the larger plot and more remote location from Midtown Manhattan it was expected to be more elaborate than St. Patrick's. The trustees had formed a Committee on Architecture in conjunction with William Robert Ware, a Columbia architecture professor, which held a design competition for St. John that involved several prominent architectural firms. Though everyone was free to enter the competition, fourteen firms and architects were paid 500 each to create designs for the cathedral. The deadline for each plan was January 1889.That May, the board of trustees formed a committee to review the more than 60 designs that had been submitted. Many of the competitors were American, though only four were experienced in cathedral construction. The board members then discussed the designs privately; some architects expressed concerns about the secret consultations, since the trustees generally did not have knowledge of architectural design. The competition was narrowed down to four finalists. Namely, these were Gerona by William A. Potter and R. H. Robertson; Three Arabesque Scrolls within a Circle by George L. Heins and Christopher Grant LaFarge with William Winthrop Kent; AMDG by George M. Huss and J. H. Buck; and Jerusalem the Golden by William Halsey Wood. Gerona used the Gothic style based on Spanish cathedrals; AMDG and Jerusalem the Golden were in a regular Gothic style, and Three Arabesque Scrolls was mainly Byzantine.Potter and Robertson were the only one of the four finalists who had significant experience at the time, and the trustees had agreed not to release any designs without the consent of all competitors, although some contestants broke the agreement anyway by revealing their designs to the media. The finalists were given more than a year to refine the details of their plans: the original deadline was set for February 1890, but was later extended to November after a failed proposal to host the World's Columbian Exposition in Morningside Park. The submissions were placed in public view in April 1891. By then, the public was losing interest in the competition, and the finalist designs mainly received negative criticism.  Plan selected  In July 1891, the plan selection committee chose Heins LaFarge's plan as the winning proposal. The design had been the trustees' second choice; although the trustees liked Potter and Robertson's plan more, W. A. Potter was the bishop's half brother and the trustees did not want to be accused of nepotism. To Kent's consternation, he was initially not recognized as a co collaborator, and would not be acknowledged as such until the following year. The group's blueprints called for chapels and end sections with apses; a crossing containing four round arches as well as a dome topped by a massive tower; and transepts with round edges. The interior was based upon Boston's Trinity Church, and the crossing was based upon Istanbul's Hagia Sophia, Venice's St. Mark's Basilica, and the P rigueux Cathedral. The exotic design was seen as an example of the unusual architecture that was prevalent at that time. It was also Heins LaFarge's first major commission: the firm later designed structures such as the Astor Court buildings at the Bronx Zoo, as well as the early stations of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the first operator of the present day New York City Subway.That October, the trustees directed the firm to revise their design further. The following month, it was announced that work would begin in early 1892, provided that Heins LaFarge submitted their revised plans that April. The original plans were then substantially revised because the board of trustees wanted a Gothic style appearance. The western towers were modified to remove the spires and enlarge the windows, and various Gothic details were placed on the facade. The nave was realigned from north south to east west so that the apse would face east, in the direction of the sunrise, to represent the resurrection of Jesus as per Episcopal tradition. Heins LaFarge objected to the realignment because it would result in the cathedral being hidden behind other buildings. In the final plan, Three Arabesque Scrolls incorporated both Byzantine and Romanesque influences, with Gothic detailing on the exterior. Outwardly, the design resembled the AMDG plan from Huss Buck. By April 1892, the trustees had raised much of the 850,000 required for land acquisition, though there still remained a deficit of 175,000.  Construction and early years  Construction on the Cathedral of St. John the Divine was begun with the cornerstone laying ceremony on December 27, 1892, St. John's Day. One thousand tickets for seats at the ceremony were distributed, though the actual attendance was 1,100. The cornerstone contained various objects such as a Bible and church papers. Potter hit the stone three times with a mallet and said Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid which is Jesus Christ. The following month, the remaining 175,000 for land acquisition had been secured, and the trustees moved to take title to the land, including the cathedral close around the cathedral's main building, in April. Unlike the main building, the cathedral close was not designed under a single master plan, and during the 1890s and 1900s, several proposals would be made for the site.  Initial construction  Actual work on St. John's began in early 1893. The trustees initially expected that work would proceed quickly because much of the Morningside Heights plateau was made of shallow bedrock. However, in September 1893, builders unexpectedly hit pockets of soft shale and an underground spring at several locations about 40 feet below ground. One of these pockets was located directly below the site for one of the four piers that were to support the cathedral's massive 445 foot stone tower. The trustees briefly considered moving the entire cathedral slightly southward. They ultimately decided against moving the cathedral, believing it to be inauspicious if the cornerstone were to be moved. Instead, builders drilled several deep shafts until they hit the bedrock, then poured concrete pits within each shaft. The pits would then accommodate the construction of the tower's piers. The pits were completed in late 1895 at a significantly higher cost than originally estimated.By 1898, St. John's had cost an estimated 750,000, and as per an 1896 estimate, the cathedral was projected to cost at least 5 million when complete. As a temporary measure, the Tiffany Chapel was purchased in mid 1898 so that services could be held there. The chapel was placed in the crypt, within the basement. The first services were held in January 1899 within the Tiffany Chapel. The crossing arches, located in the cathedral plot's eastern portion, were completed the following year, though three of the arches were temporarily sealed off until the transepts and nave could be completed. By then, some 2 million had already been spent, even though little appeared to have been completed. Despite large donations from prominent figures such as financiers John Jacob Astor IV and William Waldorf Astor, governor Levi P. Morton, banker J. P. Morgan, and businessman Cornelius Vanderbilt, the trustees continued to raise funds.In March 1903, the trustees announced that the next stage of St. John's construction would require 500,000 for building the choir and 200,000 for completing the loft, and that eight massive granite columns would need to be procured to support the roof over the choir. Furthermore, the trustees would build three arches to support the rest of the roof. The choir columns, sourced from Vinalhaven, Maine, were each 54 feet tall with a 6 foot diameter. At the time, they were the world's second largest stone columns, but because of their size, three of the columns were cracked while being turned. The columns were then transported using a specially constructed barge towed by the large steam tug Clara Clarita. When the columns arrived at Manhattan in July and August 1903, they were rolled onto flatbed trucks and brought to the cathedral's site. Since the builders did not have a derrick that was strong enough to lift the column pieces, they placed another order for wood to build a strong enough derrick. The columns were finally lifted in July 1904, more than a year after the initial announcement. The walls could not be placed until after the columns had been installed. Work also began in 1903 on the crossing ceiling, which was to contain Guastavino tiles designed by Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino.The board of trustees implemented a new charter in early 1904, which provided for greater representation of laypeople on the board. By 1905, with 800,000 available for construction, the trustees anticipated that the cathedral would be completed within a decade. The church's great organ was ordered from Skinner the following year at a cost of 50,000, following a gift by the Morton family. It was almost completed by 1911 with nearly 7,000 pipes; the cost of the organ had risen to 70,000. Work also continued on the exterior walls of the choir and the seven surrounding chapels in the apse, which required 100,000 short tons of granite. Builders estimated that 300,000 short tons of stone would have been used for the walls once work was completed. Gutzon Borglum was commissioned for some of the initial sculptural elements on St. John's, though his relation with the trustees was strained: he destroyed two angels after criticism of his work and threatened to quit in 1906. Because of the delays in construction, members of the public began to question the necessity of constructing such a large cathedral. With little progress to show for, public sentiment began to turn against the cathedral. Even the trustees started to have doubts about certain aspects of the plan, criticizing Heins LaFarge's small staff, their simultaneous involvement in many other projects, slow construction, and cost overruns.  Crossing opening and change in design  Although Heins died in 1907, LaFarge continued to design the crossing, choir, and apse of St. John's. By then, the architectural preferences of the public were shifting away from the original design. Additionally, communication between LaFarge and the trustees were deteriorating, with several trustees calling for LaFarge's removal. The choir was covered in 1908, and the crossing was installed the next year. The choir was nearly complete by October 1909, but there were insufficient funds to complete its construction, delaying its opening by at least six months. At that time, St. John's was earning about 24,000 per year and had a 500,000 endowment, while at least 1 million was needed to complete construction. In March 1911, trustees finally confirmed an opening date of April 19, 1911. The first service in the choir and crossing, the consecration of the choir, occurred as scheduled on that day. The completed portions of the cathedral were widely praised, though few newspapers devoted extensive coverage to the event, except the New York Herald.A month after the choir's consecration, the trustees suddenly fired LaFarge, commissioning Ralph Adams Cram to take LaFarge's place as lead architect of St. John's. The trustees had exercised a clause in their contract with Heins LaFarge, enabling them to hire another architect if either partner were to die. LaFarge was not made aware of the matter beforehand, and was only notified via a cable sent by his partner Benjamin Wistar Morris. The original Byzantine Romanesque design was changed to a Gothic design, and Cram was asked to convert many existing features to Gothic style. The move was criticized in the local media, who claimed that the trustees and Cram had been conspiring to eject LaFarge from the lead architect position. However, The New York Sun reported that Cram had only reluctantly accepted the commission because the trustees had threatened to hire a foreign architect otherwise.Cram presented a master plan for the cathedral close's buildings in October 1911, and his revised designs for the main structure were completed in 1913. Regardless, there was still not enough money to complete the cathedral's construction, as the New York Episcopal Diocese Cathedral League had mentioned in 1912 that 5.5 million was still needed. The diocese was able to construct several structures to the south of the main building , as part of a plan that had been approved by the trustees in late 1911. These structures included the St. Faith's House , Synod House , Cathedral School , and Cathedral House .  Nave and north transept  By January 1916, Bishop David H. Greer announced that the diocese would construct St. John's nave and narthex, along with a pair of towers on the western elevation of the facade above the narthex. The project would cost 1.5 million, even though St, John's only had about 200,000 on hand as of June 1915. A groundbreaking ceremony for the nave was held on May 8, 1916. That November, construction stopped due to material and funding shortages during World War I, and the trustees had decided against raising funds until after the war. Cram edited his plans in the interim. In February 1919, the trustees approved Cram's revised plan to incorporate a memorial for soldiers. The new plans required 5 6 million, but would make St. John's the third or fourth largest worldwide. The cathedral did not yet have the money to build the nave, and furthermore, in 1920 the trustees decided not to hold fundraising drives for said purpose. Because of an unstable economy, work did not resume for another four years, though both Greer and Bishop Charles Sumner Burch supported the project.In 1923, Burch's successor William T. Manning announced a 15 million capital campaign to raise money for this project. The New York campaign committee, headed by then governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, campaigned from 1923 to 1925 to raise 6 million . By May 1924, Manning announced that 2.5 million had been donated within the previous three months, and that work on the nave would soon begin if that rate of donation were to continue. St. John's was seeking price estimates for the nave's construction by that November, and the baptistery was donated the same year. Some 7.7 million had been raised by February 1925, and the laying of the nave's cornerstone occurred on November 9, 1925. Manning wanted the cathedral to be an interdenominational place of worship, but was still reluctant to add other denominations' members to the board of trustees. Notably, Manning rejected a request from John D. Rockefeller Jr., a Baptist, despite the latter's 500,000 donation toward the cathedral's building fund.In January 1927, Manning announced that the trustees had approved Cram's proposal for a square tower above the crossing; the tower would replace the dome, which did not conform to the Gothic style. With sides of 60 feet , the tower would be half as wide as the arches below it. Cram's blueprint revisions, published in 1929, entailed building the 300 foot tall square tower over the crossing, and adding two portals to the western elevation. Additionally, St. John's northern transept began construction in December 1927. Since the funds for that transept were donated solely by women, it was called the Women's Transept. Work on the Women's Transept was halted in October 1930 due to a lack of funds. Construction at St. John's was otherwise unaffected by the Great Depression. During this duration, work was concentrated mainly on the western elevation.When construction of the Women's Transept resumed in 1934, the nave and the western elevation were nearly complete except for the two towers above the western facade, but work on the crossing tower and south transept had yet to commence. By 1938, the nave was completed, but the temporary construction wall between the nave and crossing was still in place because the Byzantine Romanesque crossing's design had yet to be harmonized with the Gothic nave. As such, Cram subsequently replaced the portions of the ceiling above the choir and the apse's eastern section. Additionally, the nave started to be used for services, even though it had not yet been dedicated. The 1939 WPA Guide to New York City stated that 20 million had been spent on the cathedral by then.  Full length opening and expansion  The full 601 foot length of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine was opened for the first time on November 30, 1941. At that time, St. John's was only three fifths completed, yet it was the second largest Christian church in the world by area, behind only St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The event was commemorated with a week long celebration. The last day of the celebrations, Sunday December 7, 1941, coincided with the Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. With the consequent entry of the United States into World War II, work on the cathedral stopped. The southern transept and tower had yet to start, while the northern transept remained one third complete. The western towers, planned to be 266 feet , reached only to the roof of the nave. Cram revised his plans yet again just before his 1942 death, this time with shorter western towers and a slim spire in place of the square tower over the crossing.  Halt in construction  Following the end of World War II, St. John's did not experience any more new construction for three decades. In 1945, Manning had attempted to start a fundraising drive for 10 million so that the remaining funds could be raised for the cathedral's completion. However, during the late 1940s, his successor Bishop Charles Kendall Gilbert turned efforts toward alleviating social issues in the vicinity of the cathedral. Rather than being focused on expansion, the cathedral became more involved in the surrounding community. By that time, a total of 19 million had been spent on construction . By the 1950s, there was debate over whether to complete St. John's in the Gothic fashion of the nave; a more contemporary style; or the original Byzantine Romanesque style. Several plans were proposed through the early 1960s, but none were examined in depth.In 1966, it was announced that work at St. John's would resume. The trustees had approved a smaller version of the western towers and the crossing, with a modern multicolored dome to be built atop the crossing. The project did not proceed, as Bishop Horace W. B. Donegan said that such work would not occur during his administration; rather, he wanted the construction money to instead go toward helping the poor. In the 1970s, the cathedral's activities turned toward improving quality of life in Morningside Heights; helping the elderly, young, and the environment; and participating in the civil rights movement and the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. However, when the Very Reverend James Parks Morton was installed as St. John's dean in 1973, he said that construction at St. John's would start again. Morton said he wanted St. John's to become a holy place for the whole city . St. John's had become overcrowded because of its increasing focus on community activities, and even though the cathedral was losing 500,000 each year, Morton believed that an expansion would help make space for these extra activities.  Resumption of work  Morton announced in December 1978 that construction would soon begin on constructing the two western towers, extending their height by 150 feet and bringing their total height to 291 feet . The job was expected to cost 20 million and take five years. However, by then, there was a shortage of qualified stone carvers in the area. James R. Bambridge, who was hired as the stonemason, planned to employ unskilled younger workers from the surrounding community. Bambridge hired Nicholas G. Fairplay, an English stonemason, as master carver. The architect was Hoyle, Doran and Berry, the successor to Cram's architecture firm. The expansions would be based primarily on Cram's revised designs, published before his death. The north transept would be completed, but would remain separate from the main building.Work on the western facade's towers was restarted with the opening of St. John's stone yard, the Cathedral Stoneworks, which received its first several Indiana limestone blocks in June 1979. Construction started first on the south tower, named for Saint Paul, which began to rise in 1982. However, the project continued to be delayed due to a shortage of funds, and due to slow development of the towers' designs. Work also progressed slowly because the stonemasons were carving a myriad of minute details on the south tower. By 1984, St. John's was projected to be complete in 2000. Under the leadership of master stone carvers Nicholas Fairplay, Simon Verity, and Jean Claude Marchionni, work on the statuary of the central portal of the cathedral's western elevation was started in 1988 and completed in 1997. During this era, the cathedral expanded its cultural programming, hosting some 140 shows and performances in the 1987 1988 season, some of which drew up to 3,000 observers.By 1992, the construction budget had been depleted; work was halted, and the stone yard was closed. By then, another 50 feet of height had been added to the south tower. While some of the scaffolding was removed, other portions remained, rusting away for fifteen years. The Very Reverend Harry H. Pritchett Jr., who succeeded Morton in 1997, decided against further expansion of St. John's, especially since the existing facilities needed 20 40 million in repairs.  21st century  On December 18, 2001, a fire swept through the unfinished north transept, destroying the gift shop and damaging tapestries. Despite the damage sustained, St. John's reopened two weeks later. Though the pipe organ was not damaged, all its pipes and other component parts were removed and restored. Valuable tapestries and other items in the cathedral were damaged by the smoke. In January 2005, the cathedral began a major restoration to not only remove smoke damage resulting from the 2001 fire, but also clean the 80 years of dirt accumulation in the nave. The renovations temporarily depleted St. John's funds: the unaffected portions of the cathedral started to deteriorate, staff salary raises were deferred, and several staff positions were eliminated. The scaffolding around the south tower was removed in 2007, and the cathedral was rededicated on November 30, 2008.The cathedral's main building was made a city landmark in June 2003, but the designation was overturned that October, since it did not cover the entire cathedral close. At the same time, St. John's officials wanted to lease out the lots at the northern and southern borders of the cathedral close for further development, a move that preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to prevent. Ultimately, two residential buildings were erected on these lots: Avalon Morningside Park on the southern lot and the Enclave on the northern lot. In 2017, the cathedral close was re designated a city landmark, except for the two new residential buildings. The next year, the first phase of the north transept's renovation was finally completed, and work began on a renovation of the crypt.On April 14, 2019, a small fire occurred in the crypt; except for smoke damage, the cathedral building was mostly unaffected. Many artworks stored in the crypt were reportedly damaged or destroyed in the fire. An initial cleaning removed smoke damage from the bottom 10 feet of the interior of the cathedral. A cleaning of the rest of the interior was also ongoing. Also in 2019, Ennead Architects proposed erecting a copper dome above the crossing so that the crossing's tiles could be rehabilitated. On December 13, 2020, following the end of a choir performance outside the cathedral, a man fired guns at the crowd and was fatally shot by police; nobody else was injured.  Main structure  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is located at 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, between West 110th Street to the south and 113th Street to the north. The cathedral's main entrance on the west is along the same axis as 112th Street. Adjacent sites include Mount Sinai Morningside to the north, Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus to the north and west, and Morningside Park to the east. One of the key reasons for St. John's location is that the land under it was described as the highest point in Manhattan . One author wrote that the view from outside tells much about St. John's inner spirit , saying that the southeastern elevation of the facade gives an impression of incompleteness, while the great western elevation was vitalized by its incipience .St. John's is oriented west east relative to the street grid and was originally supposed to have a cruciform plan, with transepts extending to the north and south of the crossing near the eastern end of the cathedral. The entire structure measures 601 feet long. From west to east, the cathedral contains a narthex measuring 50 feet long by 207 feet wide; a nave of 248 by 146 feet ; a crossing of 100 by 100 feet ; a choir of 145 by 56 feet ; and the Chapel of St. Savior in the apse, measuring 58 feet with an ambulatory 14 feet wide. The cathedral's western elevation is 207 feet wide; if the transepts had been completed, they would have measured 330 feet from end to end. The cathedral has an interior floor area of 121,000 square feet and can host 8,600 people. As of 2017, these dimensions make St. John's the sixth largest Christian cathedral in the world, and puts it in competition with Liverpool Cathedral as being the world's largest Anglican cathedral.The original design for the cathedral was created by Heins LaFarge. Despite being primarily Byzantine and Romanesque in influence, the last version of Heins LaFarge's design contained a significantly Gothic style appearance. The original plan at St. John's called for tiled arch domes and barrel vaults. The crossing was to be held up by four round arches under a dome, with a tower on top. The completed cathedral was supposed to have been 520 feet long and 290 feet wide between transepts, while the tower would have been 450 feet tall.The modern plan for the building, as it appeared upon its official opening in 1941, conforms primarily to the second design campaign from the prolific Gothic Revival architect Ralph Adams Cram. The plans are based on the French Gothic style, with English Gothic accents. Cram had initially wanted to use English Gothic models, which typically placed less emphasis on vertical elements and height, and which contrasted with the extant parts of the cathedral. Cram's plan originally called for three main entrances; two 500 foot spires set back from the western facade; two smaller spires on the western facade. Inside were ten full height aisles, with a triforium and clerestory rising to the ceiling, as well as large chapels along each side of the nave. The design provides a transition between the nave and the crossing, because the nave was to be 50 feet wide, about half the width of the crossing. Cram, described as a brilliant perfectionist , frequently revised his proposal and later spoke of Heins LaFarge's plans as better than his own. One major change, published in 1926, called for a 300 foot tall , square tower above the crossing and five portals on the western elevation. Another revision was published just before he died in 1942, and called for a spire above the crossing. Cram's designs were not fully built, either. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine remains only two thirds complete and is often nicknamed St. John the Unfinished.  Narthex and western facade   Narthex  The narthex, in the westernmost portion of the cathedral facing Amsterdam Avenue, was designed by Cram. His original plans did not include a narthex, instead showing the nave continuing as far as the western facade. Inside the narthex is a large vestibule, which serves as an entrance to the nave on the east. The vestibule measures 180 feet along the north south axis and 85 feet along the west east axis. The southern part of the narthex contains the cathedral's gift shop.Above the narthex are two towers: one named for Saint Peter to the north and the other named for Saint Paul to the south. The north tower reaches to the roof of the nave, which is 177 feet above ground level; the south tower is about 50 feet taller, with the additional height having been built between 1982 and 1992. If the towers had been completed, they would have been about 266 feet tall. The towers protrude slightly from the northern and southern elevations of the facade but are flush with the western elevation. On the northern and southern facades of the narthex, at the base of the towers, are stained glass windows, one on each side.  Western facade  The narthex abuts the unfinished western elevation of the facade facing Amsterdam Avenue; this facade is 207 feet wide and consists of five architectural bays. The bays are separated by large arched buttresses with finials at their tops, and they contain niches for the possible future installation of statues. The western elevation is divided into four vertical tiers. From bottom to top, they are the ground level portals, on the first tier; the gallery level, on the second tier; the large rose window and several smaller grisaille and lancet windows, on the third tier; and the top of the south tower and the gable above the center bay, on the fourth tier.At ground level, there are five portals under arched openings. The largest of those is the center portal, called the Portal of Paradise, which contains carvings of the transfiguration of Jesus as well as St. John and 32 biblical characters; these were carved in 1988 under Simon Verity's leadership. St. John is depicted on the trumeau, or vertical pier, between the two pairs of doors within the center portal. The center portal also contains depictions of New York City skyscrapers being destroyed in an apocalypse. The center, northernmost, and southernmost portals are set within large, gabled structures with several archivolts, or arched moldings, surrounding each portal under the gables; porches overhang the portals above the gables. The other two portals are located under simple rectangular canopy structures, located underneath grisaille windows looking into the nave. Lights salvaged from the former Pennsylvania Station illuminate the steps in front of the portals.Above the center portal, between the towers, is a rose window installed by stained glass artist Charles Connick and constructed out of 10,000 pieces of glass. With a diameter of 40 feet , the rose window is the largest rose window in the U.S. Flanking the rose window on either side are two grisaille windows, each with two lancet windows under a smaller rose. The seven archangels are depicted in the north grisaille, while the seven churches of Asia are depicted in the south grisaille. Connick had designed the grisailles as well. On the gable above the large rose window, there are lancets as well as a medallion in the middle. The two pairs of great west doors on the western elevation, set beneath the elaborate center portal, were designed between 1927 and 1931 by the designer Henry Wilson. The bronze doors include a sequence of 60 relief panels, which presents scenes from the Old and New Testaments and the Apocalypse. The doors open three times per year: Easter; St. Francis's feast day in October; and the blessing of the bicycles in the spring. They comprise one of four bronze door commissions designed by Wilson before his death. St. John's great west doors were the last of the four commissions, each pair measuring some 18 by 12 feet . The remaining doors on the western elevation are composed of Burmese teak with wrought iron decoration.  Nave  The nave was designed by Cram, though the final plan is slightly modified from the original. It is oriented from west to east, measuring 248 feet long by 146 feet wide. The ceiling is 124 feet above ground level, but the ridge of the roof is 174 feet high. These dimensions are about the same as in the original plans, which called for floor dimensions of 260 by 150 feet . a 175 foot roof, and a 125 foot ceiling.On the northern and southern elevations, there are four vertical double bays , each with two columns of windows. Large arched buttresses, with two piers each, separate the different double bays; smaller buttresses, containing a single pier, divide each double bay into smaller sub bays . This alternation of large and small buttresses gives the appearance of four double bays with two sub bays each, rather than eight singular rectangular bays. At the arcade level, each of the sub bays contains an arrangement of stained glass with two lancet windows under a rose window. The sub bays also contain another stained glass arrangement at clerestory level, each with two lancet windows and one rose window. The clerestory arrangements each measure 45 feet long by 12 feet wide. Carved parapets, as well as gables with dormers, run along the copper roof.Inside, there are six north south rows of piers, three to either side of the nave. These piers divide the nave into five aisles running west to east, with the center aisle located on the same axis as 112th Street. There are four smaller aisles, two to either side of the center aisle. Additionally, the interior contains several flying buttresses, concealed by bridges that carry them over the outermost aisles.There are sixteen sub bays in the nave, eight on each side; the easternmost sub bays on either side contain doorways. Each of the bays are named after some aspect of humanity. From west to east, the sub bays along the northern side of the nave are named the Sports, Arts, Crusaders, Education, Lawyers, Ecclesiastical Origins , and Historical and Patriotic Societies' , and Fatherhood bays. The sub bays on the southern side are named the All Souls', Missionary, Labor, Press , Medical, Religious Life , Armed Forces , and Motherhood bays. Each of the sub bays contain carved parapets atop their mono pitched roofs. The sub bays are used for various exhibits. The iconography of the stained glass windows in the arcade and clerestory is related to the theme of each respective sub bay. In each sub bay, between the lower windows and the clerestory windows, is the triforium level, which contains two west east corridors with numerous windowless rooms and office spaces.  Apse  The apse, located at St. John's eastern end, is made up of numerous components. The center of the apse contains the choir, located below the great organ. Two ambulatory passages run adjacent to the choir, one to the north and the other to the south. Seven chapels, a baptistery, and a columbarium are also located in the northwestern part of the apse. The apse contains two sets of clerestory windows: the large ambulatory clerestories with multiple panels, as well as a smaller sanctuary clerestory window above each of the ambulatory clerestories. The apse's walls are supported by gabled buttresses, which are taller than the height of the walls, and contain niches with statues.  Choir  The choir was consecrated in 1911. It consists of two sets of wooden stalls facing each other, with three rows in each stall. The stalls were made by the Philadelphia based John Barber Company. The westernmost unit in the southern row of choir stalls is called the Dean's Stall . The roof above the choir is supported by eight columns, each 54 feet tall with a 6 foot diameter and a weight of 130 short tons . The columns' foundations descend as much as 130 feet into the bedrock below them.The parapets behind the two sections of the choir were originally installed in 1922 with twenty niches for statues of the spiritual heroes of the twenty centuries since the birth of Christ. For example, the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries are respectively represented by statues of William Shakespeare, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. The niche for the 20th century was left blank through the end of that century. In 2001 the choir parapet was completed with carvings of Martin Luther King Jr., Albert Einstein, Susan B. Anthony. and Mohandas Gandhi. In addition, the finials on both rows of stalls were carved by Otto Jahnsen and depict church music composers and performers.On the floor are tiles designed by the Grueby Faience Company, with geometric patterns and imagery reminiscent of the iconography in other cathedrals. A compass rose, the official icon of the Anglican Communion , is located on the floor between the two stalls, in the center of the choir.  Great Organ  The Great Organ was built by Ernest M. Skinner in 1906 1910. It is located above the choir on the north and south sides, and consists of four manual keyboards with several pedals. In 1954, it was enlarged by the Aeolian Skinner Organ Company, Opus 150 A, under the tonal direction of G. Donald Harrison. The organ contains 8,514 pipes, though it previously included 8,035. While most of the pipes are located above the choir stalls, the Great Organ also controls the State Trumpet, located beneath the rose window about 500 feet to the west.The 2001 fire in the north transept resulted in heavy smoke damage to the organ, and it was subsequently restored by Quimby Pipe Organs, Inc., of Warrensburg, Missouri. After two years of extensive and detailed refurbishment work, including a reorganization of many pipes and a rebuilding of the console, the organ finally returned to service in 2008 as part of an overall 41 million cleaning and repair to the cathedral. The Great Organ was damaged again in the April 2019 crypt fire, and was indefinitely placed out of service pending a thorough cleaning. While the Great Organ was being restored, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine used an electric organ.The organists have included: Walter Henry Hall Miles Farrow Norman Coke Jephcott John Upham  Alec Wyton David Pizzaro Paul Halley Dorothy Papadakos Timothy Brumfield Bruce Neswick Kent Tritle   Sanctuary  Behind the choir, to its east, is the sanctuary , a raised platform. The chancel includes the high altar, which is made of white Vermont marble. The Magna Carta Pedestal named as such because it is located atop three stones from the Bury St Edmunds Abbey in England is located to the right, while the sedilia for the bishop and other clergy is to the left. The sanctuary also contains the cathedra , donated by Olivia Egleston Phelps Stokes in memory of her sister Caroline Phelps Stokes. The bishop's pulpit is made of Tennessee marble, with five niches, each of which contain reliefs that depict scenes from the life of Christ. A presbytery, which houses the officiating clergy of St. John's, is located between the chancel and the choir. The reredos behind the sanctuary depicts four scenes from the Old Testament on the left , and four from the New Testament on the right .Behind the altar is a wrought iron enclosure. The space contains the English Gothic style tomb of the man who originally conceived and founded the cathedral, the Right Reverend Horatio Potter, which was dedicated in 1921.  Ambulatory and chapels  An ambulatory, measuring 250 feet long and 14 feet wide, surrounds the choir to the north, east, and south, making a rough U shape with the two ends of the U facing west. The floor is covered with red clay colored tiles that contain green serpentine borders. There are 30 foot tall wrought steel gates at either end of the ambulatory. Numerous plaques are present in the ambulatory, paying homage to large donors and other notable individuals in St. John's history. A poetry wall and several Madonna paintings are also located in the ambulatory, particularly in the southern part of the ambulatory.Extending outward from the ambulatory are seven chapels. These chapels are known as the Chapels of the Tongues , and all were donated by prominent individuals and families. The chapels were designed by four different architects and firms: Heins LaFarge designed two of the chapels, while Cram designed a third. The Chapels of the Tongues were devoted to seven of the city's largest immigrant groups when the apse was completed: the southernmost three chapels represent Latin races and the northernmost three chapels represent Germanic races . All of the chapels, except for St. Ansgar's, were donated by individuals or families. Clockwise from north, they are devoted to: St. Ansgar, patron of Denmark; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1918. St. Ansgar Chapel has its own organ. St. Boniface, apostle of the Germans; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1916. St. Columba, patron of Ireland and Scotland; designed by Heins LaFarge, dedicated 1911. St. Savior , devoted to immigrants from Africa and Asia; designed by Heins LaFarge, dedicated 1911. St. Savior was the first chapel to be complete, hosting its first services in 1904. It contains a bronze three paneled altar with gold leaf decoration, designed by Keith Haring just before his death. St. Martin of Tours, patron of the French; designed by Cram Ferguson, dedicated 1918. St. Ambrose, patron of Milan; designed by Carr re and Hastings, dedicated 1914. St. James, patron of Spain; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1916. St. James Chapel is the largest apsidal chapel, with a seating capacity of 25 people, and is frequently utilized for small funerals, weddings, or worship services. The chapel has its own choir and 857 pipe organ.The northwest corner of the apse, adjacent to the St. Ansgar Chapel, includes the octagonal baptistery. The baptistery was donated by three Stuyvesant family siblings in 1924. The space measures 31 feet in diameter with a ceiling 43 feet tall. The baptistery's iconography depicts the Stuyvesant family history; icons of New Amsterdam, New York, and Dutch history; and the 12 apostles.The columbarium, established in the 1970s, is in a room directly west of the baptistery. It contains marble vaults, which store the remains of people from all religions.  Crossing  Between the nave to the west and the apse to the east is the crossing, designed by Rafael Guastavino. The interior of the crossing includes four massive granite arches, which in the original Heins LaFarge design were originally intended to support the massive 445 foot tower above it. When completed in 1900, the arches were described as the crowning glory of Morningside Heights. During the time that the nave remained incomplete, temporary walls were placed within the arches so that services could be held in the crossing.Above the crossing is a domed roof, which was meant as a temporary covering until the tower above the crossing was built. It was completed within fifteen weeks between May and August 1909. The dome is shaped like a saucer, and consists of several overlapping layers of Guastavino tile, which support themselves around the dome's center upon their own weight. The pendentives, or triangular areas between the circular dome and the corners of the arches, are 1 inch thick; the thickness of the dome itself ranges from 4 inches on top to 7.5 inches at the bottom. Compared to conventional ceilings, the tiles saved money because they did not require temporary supports when they were installed. For added strength, metal rods were included in the dome's shell.The dome was originally intended to be temporary. Cram had proposed three plans for the structure above the crossing: a steeple, a square tower rising 500 feet above the crossing floor, and then a slim spire. None of these plans were realized. In 2019, Ennead Architects proposed to build a copper dome over the crossing so that the ceiling tiles could be renovated.  Basement  Directly below the crossing is the basement, which contains the crypt, now used as a storage area. The items stored in the crypt include artifacts such as pieces of the destroyed Pennsylvania Station and World Trade Center, as well as wooden angels, plaster gargoyles, leadlights, antique furniture, and a single file line of saints. The crypt also includes objects such as a large fossil and a massive crystal of quartz, both of which were relocated to the crypt after the 2001 fire. Along either side the basement are rooms, each named after the chapels that they are located under. In the 1980s, the crypt was also home to the Cathedral Works Company, which sold textiles.The crypt also formerly contained the Tiffany Chapel, created by jewelry designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. Originally exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, it was then acquired by Celia Whipple Wallace and moved to the cathedral in 1898. Services at the cathedral were hosted at the Tiffany Chapel from 1899 to 1911, and the chapel was reacquired by Tiffany in 1916. The chapel has been in the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida, since 1999.  Cathedral close  The cathedral close, surrounding the main cathedral, consists of several buildings on a 11.5 acre site, including the former Leake Watts asylum building, which predates the land's acquisition by the Episcopal Diocese of New York. The other structures were built later.The former asylum is located immediately south of the crossing. The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine is located on the eastern boundary of the site, just south of the apse. A Biblical garden is located between the school and the asylum building. To the southwest is a pulpit green, situated between the nave to the north and the Synod Hall and Diocesan House to the south. The Cathedral House is located south of the Biblical garden and east of the pulpit green. The Synod Hall and Diocesan House are located on the southern boundary. Various paths, gardens, play areas, and furniture are located on the cathedral close, as are numerous artworks and several commemorative or religious objects.The initial plans for the cathedral close, put forth in the 1890s, varied widely. The included a 1892 plan for buildings on Morningside Drive and Cathedral Parkway; various proposals for an Episcopal residence somewhere along the close; and an 1898 1899 plan for a deaconesses' training school. Two other plans were proposed in 1902 and 1903, but after objections to the 1903 plan from St. Luke's Hospital, a new plan was presented in 1906. The Training School for Deaconesses was completed in 1909, independently of the plan. Cram presented to the trustees an extensive plan for all the structures on the grounds in October 1911, and the trustees approved the choir school the same month. The following month, the trustees certified plans for the Synod Hall, bishop's house, and deanery, as well as the never built diocesan offices and canons' residences. A heating plant at the southwestern corner of the cathedral close , and two structures planned for the western boundary and approved in 1920, were not built.  Ithiel Town Building  The former Leake and Watts Asylum building, designed by Ithiel Town and completed in 1843, is located south of the crossing, where the south transept would have been located. The building, designed in the Greek Revival style, was originally composed of five parts. There was a central pavilion with Ionic style porticos to the south and north. The front entrance, located within the south portico, was approached by a wide granite staircase. The only decorative element was at the south portico's pediment, which was supported by six stucco covered brick columns, topped by capitals made of wood. Brick wings flanked the central pavilion to each side, and originally contained wooden porches along their facades, replaced with iron balconies in 1888. Originally, there were common areas and staff rooms within the central pavilion, and dormitories for 300 children in the wings. When the Episcopal Diocese of New York acquired the site, the former asylum building served several functions for the cathedral. Between 1892 and 1899, it was used as an employee dormitory and construction offices, while the parlor hosted worship services. Afterward, the former asylum's west wing was used by the day school for the cathedral's choirboys between 1901 and 1913. Cathedral leaders had proposed demolishing parts of the asylum building, since it was in the way of the proposed southern transept, though these demolitions did not happen. Subsequently, the west wing was used by the Diocese offices, and the east wing by Cathedral offices until 1949. The building then became the Exhibit Hall and the top stories were removed sometime afterward. The structure was renovated in 2004 2012, becoming the Ithiel Town Building .The Ithiel Town Building houses a textile laboratory that conserves the cathedral's textiles, including the Barberini tapestries to cartoons by Raphael. The laboratory also conserves tapestries, needlepoint, upholstery, costumes, and other textiles for its clients. The building has also housed the Museum of Religious Art, as well as offices, shops, choir rehearsal quarters, sacristies, and the Cathedral Community Cares program.  Diocesan House  The Diocesan House, also known as St. Faith's House, is the only building on the cathedral close to be designed by Heins LaFarge before they were fired. The structure, designed in the Tudor Gothic style, is located on the southern side of the cathedral close, close to Cathedral Parkway . It is a 3 1 2 story H shaped building with a brick facade, a base of Indiana limestone, and gable roofs above the pavilions on the western end. The southern elevation also contains an additional basement story. Its main entrance, on the eastern portion of the northern elevation, is a recessed arched portal with an oriel window on the third story. As of 2017, the Diocesan House is used by the diocese's offices and archives; the cathedral's library; and apartments.The Diocesan House was originally built for the New York Training School for Deaconesses, which was established in 1890 and had been searching for new locations since 1898 or 1899. Funds to build the structure were finally received in 1907 after Archdeacon Charles Comfort Tiffany included 125,000 for the deaconesses' school in his will. The building was originally supposed to be on the northern side of the cathedral close, but was moved due to objections from St. Luke's Hospital. Construction started in May 1910 and the school opened by that October. All work was finished in February 1911, and the building was used as a deaconesses' school until May 1948, and it was converted to office use the following year.  Synod Hall  The Synod Hall houses the cathedral's synod or council, but is also used for various events and other functions. It was completed in 1913 and was the first of four structures on the cathedral close to be designed by Cram, and was designed to be the most beautiful thing in New York . It is located at the southwestern corner of the cathedral close. The main entrance, an arched portal facing Amsterdam Avenue, contains carvings of Christian figures, which flank oak double doors. A carving of George Washington is located between the doors, and six smaller figures are located on the tympanum above the doors. The exterior is made of pink Kingwood sandstone. Inside is a hall that can seat over a thousand people, with gallery seating above the main level. There are grisaille windows to the north and south, and wooden trusses on the ceiling, supporting the gable roof. The Synod Hall also contains a three manual Skinner pipe organ.Plans for a diocesan building were considered as early as 1903. The current Synod Hall was announced in 1911, in preparation for the 1913 General Convention of the Episcopal Church. Cram's firm submitted plans for Synod Hall in March 1912, and it opened in October 1913 with the start of the convention. However, the hall was not completed until early 1914. After Bayard Cutting and J. P. Morgan made large donations toward the Synod Hall, the cathedral had to return some of the previous donations, as the two men had given more than enough funds to pay for the building.  School  The choir school building, now the Cathedral School of St. John the Divine, is located on the cathedral close's eastern border. The building is in the Collegiate Gothic style and is 4 1 2 stories tall. The exterior contains gray schist cladding and limestone trim, with architectural features such as a gabled roof, dormers protruding from the roof, and Tudor style arched openings. Inside, the building contained classrooms; gathering space for reception, dining; music rooms; a library; a gymnasium; a dormitory; and masters' and service rooms.The choir school was created in 1901 within the Town Building. A separate structure was first proposed in Walter Cook Winthrop A. Welch's 1906 plan for the campus. In January 1910, Mary Eliza Blodgett donated 25,000 toward the new school building's projected 150,000 cost, as a gift to honor her father John H. Sherwood. Blodgett later covered the rest of the choir school building's cost after no one else donated, while former choirboy Frederick G. Bourne provided a 500,000 endowment in 1914. Cram approved Cook Welch's plan in January 1912 and filed construction plans that July, with work beginning that October. The school building was finished in September 1913. The choir school consisted of day school for 20 adult men and a boarding school for 40 choirboys who paid no tuition. It was turned into a boys' day school in 1964 and a coeducational day school for grades K 8 in 1972.  Bishop's house and deanery  The Episcopal Residence, consisting of the bishop's house and deanery , were the final buildings that Cram designed within the cathedral close. The structures were intentionally built close together to evoke a feeling of coziness. According to Cram, the Chateauesque style buildings were inspired by later domestic buildings in the French Gothic style. The bishop's house is west of the deanery, on slightly higher ground; the deanery is thus hidden behind the bishop's house. A small garden is located at the northeast corner of the buildings.As built, the two structures contained a myriad of living space inside. The bishop's house contained eight rooms with seven bathrooms, while the deanery contained 20 rooms with five bathrooms. The deanery is three stories tall; like the choir school, it has gray schist cladding and limestone trim. It contains several pavilions with dormers and gabled roofs, as well as a loggia and an oriel window on the southern elevation. The bishop's house is four stories tall and is largely in the same design, but part of the northern elevation is made of exposed brick, marking the location where it would have connected to the unbuilt southern transept. The ornamentation of the bishop's house contains symbols of the diocesan offices, such as bishops; by contrast, the deanery has simpler decorations, such as depictions of flowers and cats. A private chapel between the two buildings was not built.An episcopal residence had been announced in 1897 and Heins LaFarge drew up plans for such a structure in 1902. The Deanery was donated by Helen Slade Ogilvie in 1911 in memory of her late husband Clinton, while the bishop's house was funded partly by the sale of a previous bishop's house at Gramercy Park. Initially, the site of the two structures was contested because the buildings would have blocked views of the main cathedral from the south. Before the structures' construction started in 1912, the sites for the bishop's house and deanery were relocated eastward. The two buildings' sites were given preliminary approval in May 1912 and were officially approved that October. The bishop's house started in November 1912 and was finished in April 1914. while the deanery was started in February 1913 and completed by that November. Both structures were erected by Leonard Jacob and Frederick T. Youngs. After the 1947 Diocesan Convention, the bishop moved into the upper two floors of the deanery, and the old bishop's house was turned into administration offices.  Residential buildings  In 2008, the cathedral leased the southeast corner of its property, which contained the cathedral's playground and Rose Garden, to the AvalonBay Communities, which built a luxury apartment building called the Avalon Morningside Park. The project includes 295 apartments, of which 20 are affordable housing units, as well as replacement rose garden. The cathedral leased the northeastern edge of its property, formerly a parking lot, in 2012. The lessee was the Brodsky Organization, which built a residential building called the Enclave between 2014 and 2015. The Enclave consists of 428 rental apartments in two 15 story buildings, separated by the passageway leading to the northern transept; an underground gallery connects the two buildings.Both developments leased the land from the cathedral for 99 year terms. The lease on the land under the Enclave pays the Cathedral about 3 million a year; the lease on the Avalon, about 2.5 million.  Art, activities, and exhibitions   Concerts and special events  The cathedral's interior is frequently used for concerts, performances, and other special events.  Recurring events  The cathedral has an annual New Year's Eve Concert for Peace. The Postlude to Act I of Leonard Bernstein's opera Quiet Place received its New York premiere at the 1985 concert. The 1990 concert was a tribute to Bernstein himself, who helped found the event and had died two months earlier on October 14.Paul Winter has given many concerts at the cathedral, and the Paul Winter Consort are the artists in residence. Among the major musical events that takes place every year is a celebration of the feast day of St. Francis, when the Paul Winter Consort participates in a liturgical performance of Winter's Missa Gaia . The musical group also performs at the annual Winter Solstice program.  One time events  The cathedral has also been used for several individual events: Duke Ellington's Second Sacred Concert, of his original sacred music compositions, premiered at the cathedral on January 19, 1968. When construction on the south tower restarted in 1982, French high wire artist Philippe Petit walked on a tightrope stretched across Amsterdam Avenue. Petit was also the artist in residence at St. John's starting in 1982. In 1990, the avant garde musician Diamanda Galas performed Plague Mass, a culmination of her work dedicated to the victims of the AIDS epidemic. Galas's performance consisted of covering her body in cattle blood and reinterpreting biblical texts and classic literature. She said it was a protest against what she saw as the ignorance and condemnation toward people with AIDS from religious and political groups. On December 8, 1994, Mariah Carey hosted a benefit concert for The Fresh Air Fund. The concert helped raise 700,000 to support the Fresh Air Fund and Carey's own Camp Mariah, and an additional 1 million from Carey herself. In November 2017, Aretha Franklin held her last large public concert, a 25th anniversary event for the Elton John AIDS Foundation being hosted at the cathedral.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine has also hosted events with spiritual leaders. Among them are Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, who first visited the cathedral in 1979. In addition, Bishop Desmond Tutu led a service in the cathedral in 1986.  Temporary art exhibitions  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is also used as an art exhibition space: In 1977, a sculpture dedicated to the 12 firemen who died in the 23rd Street Fire of 1966 was unveiled at St. John's. Edwina Sandys's Christa, a sculpture exhibited during Holy Week in 1984, was based upon the feminine divine. Though the sculpture generally received positive acclaim, several pieces of hate mail were addressed to the cathedral, accusing the cathedral of blasphemy with its depiction of Christ on the cross. The statue was displayed again at The Christa Project: Manifesting Divine Bodies exhibition in 2016. The Value of Water, curated by artist activist Fredericka Foster, was exhibited at the cathedral in 2011. Featuring over forty artists, it was the largest ever art exhibition to appear at the cathedral. In 2014, the cathedral housed Phoenix, a sculptural group by Chinese artist Xu Bing. The two sculptures that comprised Phoenix was one of the largest pieces of sculpture ever displayed in the United States, weighing 12 short tons with lengths of 90 and 100 feet .  Poets' Corner  The Poets' Corner, inspired by a similar corner at Westminster Abbey, is located in the Arts Bay, on the nave's northern side. It was dedicated in 1985, with Emily Dickinson, Washington Irving, and Walt Whitman being the first poets to be inducted as part of the tradition. The Poets' Corner consists of a poet in residence, hired for a five year term, who in turn appoints electors on staggered terms. The poets in residence and electors have included 17 United States Poet Laureates. The electors then vote on choices for honorees, whose names are carved into blocks in the Poets' Corner; subsequent honorees have included Edgar Allan Poe, T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and William Carlos Williams. The electors' choices can be overturned, as occurred in 1999, when the Very Reverend Harry Pritchett vetoed Ezra Pound's inclusion because of Pound's anti Semitic statements during World War II.  Permanent works  The pulpit green contains the Peace Fountain, a large bronze work of public art by the cathedral's sculptor in residence, Greg Wyatt. It was commissioned in 1985 and depicts the struggle of good and evil; a battle between the Archangel Michael and Satan; and images of the Sun, the Moon, and several animals.  Advocacy Throughout the years, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has been involved in various initiatives and projects. These programs included youth initiatives, a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, and AIDS outreach. During the Vietnam War, the cathedral was also part of the opposition to United States involvement in the war. The Temple of Understanding, an interfaith organization, was housed at the cathedral for several decades in the late 20th century, moving to Midtown Manhattan in the 1990s.Several programs have been directed toward helping members of the surrounding community. In 1971, the cathedral founded ACT , a program that provided after school activities and summer camp to children in the neighborhood. The program still runs as of 2018 under the name Advancing the Community of Tomorrow . In 1974, in response to a need for housing in New York City, St. John's created a program that became the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board ; by 1987, the program had helped residential tenants in over 500 buildings to renovate and take ownership of their houses. Additionally, a homeless shelter, crisis center, clothes closet, and kitchen are run by in house volunteers.

These tours require paid tickets; there are discounts for seniors and students, as well as for those in tour groups. Admission is also included within several New York City tourist passes. The cathedral is open for tourism between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays, and between 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. on Sundays; it is open for worship between 7:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on all days of the week. Additionally, St. John's offers three types of daily tours , specific tours of different aspects of the cathedral, which cost more than the regular tickets.  Landmark status The Cathedral of St. John the Divine complex had been considered for designation as an official landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966. At the time, St. John's trustees had opposed the move because the structure was incomplete, and a landmark designation would have required the commission to review every proposed major expansion thereafter. The church's trustees were able to prevent designation by claiming the church was not completed, using a stipulation in the landmark's law that stated that potential landmarks had to have been completed for at least 30 years. A subsequent landmark designation was precluded in 1979 for a similar reason.In 2003, the exterior of the cathedral was again considered for landmark status; the interior was ineligible because the commission was legally unable to recognize religious buildings' interiors as landmarks. However, shortly after the commission conferred landmark status on the structure, the designation was unanimously overturned by the New York City Council, some of whose members favored landmark status for the entire cathedral close instead of just the main building. Councilman Bill Perkins proposed that the protective status should also be extended to the cathedral's grounds in order to control development there. The lack of an official city landmark designation meant that the cathedral site could potentially be redeveloped, and as such, two residential buildings were built on the same block as the cathedral. In 2017, the cathedral and six other buildings on the grounds were re designated a New York City Landmark; the designation excludes the two new structures.

            "text": "Certified Software Development Professional is a vendor neutral professional certification in software engineering developed by the IEEE Computer Society for experienced software engineering professionals. This certification was offered globally since 2001 through Dec. 2014. The certification program constituted an element of the Computer Society's major efforts in the area of Software engineering professionalism, along with the IEEE CS and ACM Software Engineering 2004 Undergraduate Curricula Recommendations, and The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge , completed two years later. As a further development of these elements, to facilitate the global portability of the software engineering certification, since 2005 through 2008 the International Standard ISO IEC 24773:2008 Software engineering Certification of software engineering professionals Comparison framework has been developed. The standard was formulated in such a way, that it allowed to recognize the CSDP certification scheme as basically aligned with it, soon after the standard's release date, 2008 09 01. Several later revisions of the CSDP certification were undertaken with the aim of making the alignment more complete. In 2019, ISO IEC 24773:2008 has been withdrawn and revised . The certification was initially offered by the IEEE Computer Society to experienced software engineering and software development practitioners globally in 2001 in the course of the certification examination beta testing. The CSDP certification program has been officially approved in 2002. After December 2014 this certification program has been discontinued, all issued certificates are recognized as valid forever. A number of new similar certifications were introduced by the IEEE Computer Society, including the Professional Software Engineering Master and Professional Software Engineering Process Master Certifications . To become a Certified Software Development Professional candidates had to have four years of professional software engineering experience, pass a three and half hour, 180 question examination on various knowledge areas of software engineering, and possess at least a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering. The CSDP examination tested candidates' proficiency in internationally accepted, industry standard software engineering principles and practices. CSDP credential holders are also obligated to adhere to the IEEE ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice. As of 2021, the IEEE CS offer which is a successor to CSDP is the Professional Software Engineering Master certification. The exam is three hours, is proctored remotely, and consists of 160 questions over the 11 SWEBOK knowledge areas: Software Requirements, Software Design, Software Construction, Software Testing, Software Maintenance, Software Configuration Management, Software Engineering Management, Software Engineering Process, Software Engineering Models and Methods, Software Quality, Software Engineering Economics. certification, which covers only 4 knowledge areas: software requirements, software design, software construction, and software testing. The similarity of the name of this certification to the CSDP is confusing, it is a reputable credential but NOT an equivalent of CSDP.  History The IEEE Computer Society introduced the CSDP in 2002, and on October 27, 2008, it became the first certification to conform to ISO IEC 24773 standard for software engineering certification.  Determination of eligibility Candidates had to undergo a peer review of their education and professional qualifications in order to receive authorization to take the CSDP examination. Candidates therefore had to submit an application to the IEEE Computer Society that provided verifiable information regarding their educational background and professional experience. The Certified Software Development Associate certification was available to graduating students and early career software professionals who did not meet the eligibility requirements for the CSDP.  CSDP examination content The CSDP examination content was based on the Guide To The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. The examination covered content from all primary knowledge areas in the SWEBOK Guide Version 3. Below is a list of the topics tested in terms of their proportion of the total examination.

            "text": "Charles Augustin de Coulomb was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulomb's law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. He also did important work on friction. The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1880.  Life Charles Augustin de Coulomb was born in Angoul me, Angoumois county, France, to Henry Coulomb, an inspector of the royal demesne originally from Montpellier, and Catherine Bajet. He was baptised at the parish church of St. Andr . The family moved to Paris early in his childhood, and he studied at Coll ge Mazarin. His studies included philosophy, language and literature. He also received a good education in mathematics, astronomy, chemistry and botany. When his father suffered a financial setback, he was forced to leave Paris, and went to Montpellier. Coulomb submitted his first publication to the Society of Sciences in Montpellier during this time. He went back to Paris and passed the exams for the cole royale du g nie de M zi res in 1760. He graduated in 1761 and joined the French army as an engineer with the rank of lieutenant. Over the next twenty years, he was posted to a variety of locations where he was involved in engineering: structural, fortifications, soil mechanics, as well as other fields of engineering. His first posting was to Brest but in February 1764 he was sent to Martinique, in the West Indies, where he was put in charge of building the new Fort Bourbon and this task occupied him until June 1772. His health suffered setbacks during the three years he spent in Martinique that would affect him for the rest of his life. On his return to France, Coulomb was sent to Bouchain. However, he now began to write important works on applied mechanics and he presented his first work to the Acad mie des Sciences in Paris in 1773. In 1779 Coulomb was sent to Rochefort to collaborate with the Marquis de Montalembert in constructing a fort made entirely from wood near le d'Aix. During his period at Rochefort, Coulomb carried on his research into mechanics, in particular using the shipyards in Rochefort as laboratories for his experiments. Also in 1779 he published an important investigation of the laws of friction , which was followed twenty years later by a memoir on fluid resistance.Upon his return to France, with the rank of captain, he was employed at La Rochelle, the Isle of Aix and Cherbourg. He discovered first an inverse relationship of the force between electric charges and the square of its distance and then the same relationship between magnetic poles. Later these relationships were named after him as Coulomb's law. In 1781, he was stationed at Paris. In 1787 with Tenon he visited the Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse and they were impressed by the revolutionary pavilion design and recommended it to the French government. On the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he resigned his appointment as intendant des eaux et fontaines and retired to a small estate which he possessed at Blois.He was recalled to Paris for a time in order to take part in the new determination of weights and measures, which had been decreed by the Revolutionary government. He became one of the first members of the French National Institute and was appointed inspector of public instruction in 1802. His health was already very feeble and four years later he died in Paris. Coulomb leaves a legacy as a pioneer in the field of geotechnical engineering for his contribution to retaining wall design. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.   Research In 1784, his memoir Recherches th oriques et exp rimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l' lasticit des fils de metal appeared. This memoir contained the results of Coulomb's experiments on the torsional force for metal wires, specifically within a torsion balance. His general result is: the moment of the torque is, for wires of the same metal, proportional to the torsional angle, the fourth power of the diameter and the inverse of the length of the wire. In 1785, Coulomb presented his first three reports on electricity and magnetism: Premier M moire sur l lectricit et le Magn tisme . In this publication, Coulomb describes How to construct and use an electric balance based on the property of the metal wires of having a reaction torsion force proportional to the torsion angle. Coulomb also experimentally determined the law that explains how two bodies electrified of the same kind of Electricity exert on each other. On page 574 he states:Il r sulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action r pulsive que les deux balles lectrif es de la m me nature d' lectricit exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison inverse du carr des distances. Translation: It follows therefore from these three tests, that the repulsive force that the two balls which were electrified with the same kind of electricity exert on each other, follows the inverse proportion of the square of the distance. Second M moire sur l lectricit et le Magn tisme . In this publication, Coulomb carries out the determination according to which laws both the Magnetic and the Electric fluids act, either by repulsion or by attraction. On page 579, he states that the attractive force between two oppositely charged spheres is proportional to the product of the quantities of charge on the spheres and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the spheres. Troisi me M moire sur l lectricit et le Magn tisme . On the quantity of Electricity that an isolated body loses in a certain time period, either by contact with less humid air or in the supports more or less idio electric. Four subsequent reports were published in the following years: Quatri me M moire Where two principal properties of the electric fluid are demonstrated: first, that this fluid does not expand into any object according to a chemical affinity or by an elective attraction, but that it divides itself between different objects brought into contact; second, that in conducting objects, the fluid, having achieved a state of stability, expands on the surface of the body and does not penetrate into the interior.  Cinqui me M moire On the manner in which the electric fluid divides itself between conducting objects brought into contact and the distribution of this fluid on the different parts of the surface of this object.  Sixi me M moire Continuation of research into the distribution of the electric fluid between several conductors. Determination of electric density at different points on the surface of these bodies.  Septi me M moire On magnetism Coulomb explained the laws of attraction and repulsion between electric charges and magnetic poles, although he did not find any relationship between the two phenomena. He thought that the attraction and repulsion were due to different kinds of fluids. Coulomb also made a significant contribution to the field of tribology. He completed the most comprehensive study of friction undertaken in the eighteenth century and was named as one of the 23 Men of Tribology by Duncan Dowson.

            "text": "Charles Grafton Page was an American scientist who developed several electrical devices for which he obtained United States patents. He was also a physician, patent examiner, and college professor of chemistry. Like contemporaries Joseph Henry and Michael Faraday, Page began his career as a naturally curious investigator who conducted original research through direct observation and experimentation. Through his experimentation, Page helped develop a scientific understanding of the principles of electromagnetism. Page served as a patent examiner at the United States Patent Office, where his knowledge of electromagnetism was useful in the innovation process and in his own desire to develop electromagnetic locomotion. His work had a lasting impact on telegraphy and in the practice and politics of patenting scientific innovation. Page's views of patenting innovations challenged a commonly held belief at the time that maintained that scientists do not patent their inventions. Through his investigations of inductive coils, Page developed a device which he called the dynamic multiplier. In this device, an electrical impulse is provided to the inductive coil, resulting in a high voltage. In certain configurations of Page's device that involve an electromagnet, the impulse provided to the device results in an audio tone. Page called this galvanic music . Alexander Graham Bell and others developed telephone technology based on this peculiar electro acoustic phenomenon. Page advocated the use of electroconvulsive therapy as a medical treatment. He believed that electrical voltages higher than the typical low voltage of batteries would result in medical benefits.  Early family life Charles Grafton Page was born to Captain Jere Lee Page and Lucy Lang Page on January 25, 1812, in Salem, Massachusetts. He was a descendant of John Page who had come from England in 1630 and settled in Massachusetts. Having eight siblings, four of each gender, he was the only one of five sons to pursue a career into mature adulthood. One of his brothers died in infancy. His brother George died from typhoid at age sixteen, his brother Jery perished on a sea expedition to the Caribbean at age twenty five, and Henry, afflicted by poliomyelitis, was not able to support himself. In writing to Page during his final ill fated voyage Jery expressed the family's hope for his success.Page's curiosity about electricity was evident from childhood. At age nine, he climbed on top of his parents' house with a fire shovel in an attempt to catch electricity during a thunderstorm. At age ten, he built an electrostatic machine that he used to give his friends electric shocks. At sixteen, Page developed the portable electrophorus, which served as the foundation for his first published article in American Journal of Science . Page's other early interests included botany, entomology, and floriculture which contributed to his scientific training and later hobbies and pastimes.  Mid life and education Page prepared for college in the Salem Grammar School under the charge of Theodore Eames. He entered Harvard College in 1828 when he was 16 years old graduating in 1832, studying medicine with A. L. Peirson at Harvard Medical School. In 1836, he received the degree for being a Medical Doctor. At Harvard College he studied chemistry under John White Webster. Henry Wheatland, a classmate at Salem Latin School who also attended college and medical school with him, described Page as popular, fun loving, athletic, a fine singer and a loved companion . Page participated in organizing a college chemical club where he demonstrated electricity and other phenomena. While pursuing a medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1836, he gave lectures in chemistry to college students.Page continued to reside in his parents' Salem home in Virginia from 1838 and opened a small medical practice after graduating becoming a medical doctor for two years. In a well stocked lab that he set up there, he experimented with electricity, demonstrated effects that no one had observed before, and constructed original electromagnetic mechanisms that intensified these effects. In 1838, his father retired from a successful career as a sea captain in trade with East India. In 1840, he relocated his entire family to Fairfax County in rural Virginia some five miles from Washington, D.C., where he purchased a half section of land containing 320 acres .In 1840 he took a position in the US Patent Office as an examiner. Page continued his experimental research and set up a medical practice as a country doctor for a few years when he had moved to northern Virginia with his parents. His new career was not very fruitful and in 1840 he was forced to sell off his prized possession, an entomological cabinet insect collection, to support himself. He ran an ad for it in Silliman's Journal, selling it for 400 . Page visited Washington, D.C., often and moved there in 1842. He was Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy from 1844 to 1849 in the Medical Department at Columbian College in Washington, D. C. . He held other public roles also such as that of advising the choice of stone to be used in constructing the Smithsonian Institution and the Washington Monument to the committees in charge of these projects.  Career Page worked in Washington, D.C., as a patent examiner for the U.S. Patent Office from 1853 through 1860. Page was a patent agent in 1853, 1854, and 1855 handling up to 50 successful patents a year. He processed patents for Eben Norton Horsford, a Harvard professor; Walter Hunt, inventor of the safety pin and sewing machine; Birdsill Holly, various mechanical devices; Theodore Weed, sewing machine mechanisms; Thomson Newbury, machine tool attachments; John North, paper folding machines; Lysander Button, fire engine hydraulic paraphernalia with Robert Blake, who together created in 1860 the firm 'Button and Blake' that dominated the fire engine business in the United States for several years. Page was a patent counselor to friends like Ari Davis, who constructed mechanical apparatus and electrical devices for others and their inventions.The American Civil War affected the Patent Office as much as the new administration of Abraham Lincoln did. The number of patent applications in 1860 was 7,653. In 1861, this dropped some 3,000 to about 4,600 applications. The office was required by law to be self supporting but the commissioner under Lincoln throughout the war had a wake of dismissals. Sixteen examiners were authorized, however less than half that were filled by him. In addition in governing the department he demoted the examiners and paid them the salary for assistants. The amount of applications increased as the war went on and by 1864 was within 800 of the pre war high and was over 10,000 in 1865. The examiners of the short staff had to handle three times that processed in the 1850s. Mindful accurate examinations were out of the question and a lackadaisical attitude came about to process the applications. Page passed nearly every application given to him to process, even without correcting the wording of the claim if wrong. Congress in time authorized a supplementary appropriation and the number of examiners was increased to twelve. However the examiners on staff were not paid any more and Page struggled to provide for his nearly dozen dependents on a monthly income of 150 .The time of the civil war was not a lucrative time for Page and in addition the Patent Office was partly converted to an army hospital so the environment around him was daunting. The war wreaked a further devastating impact on Page's scientific work and legacy. In 1863, Union soldiers stationed in the area of Page's home, broke into his laboratory as a random, unprovoked act of violence. His equipment, inventions and laboratory notebooks were destroyed. Some other inventions by Page which he had donated to the Smithsonian Institution were destroyed by a fire there in 1865. As a result of these destructive events, very few of Page's handmade devices exist today.Page figured as a key witness in the Morse v. O'Reilly telegraph lawsuit of 1848. However, when Morse sought an extension of his patent on telegraph apparatus twelve years later, Page refuted Morse's role as inventor and was perhaps influential in the extensions' denial. Throughout his life, Page published more than one hundred articles over the course of three distinct periods: the late 1830s, the mid 1840s, and the early 1850s. The first period was especially crucial in developing his analytic skills. Over 40 of his articles appeared in American Journal of Science edited by Benjamin Silliman; some of these were reprinted at the time in William Sturgeon s Annals of Electricity, Magnetism printed in Great Britain. The Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers records many of Page's papers, however this listing is incomplete.  Scientific accomplishments   Self inductive coil  While still a medical student at Harvard, Page conducted a ground breaking experiment which demonstrated the presence of electricity in an arrangement of a spiral conductor that no one had tried before. His experiment was a response to a short paper by Joseph Henry, announcing that a strong electric shock was obtained from a ribbon strip of copper, spiralled up between fabric insulation, at the moment when battery current stopped running in this conductor. These strong shocks manifested the electrical property of self inductance which Faraday had identified in researches published prior to Henry's publication, building on his own landmark discovery of electromagnetic induction. Page was not aware of Faraday's research on electricity that had inspired Henry to write his paper. He did his own experimentation to come to his own conclusions.Page's innovation was to construct a spiral conductor having cups filled with mercury as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length. He then connected a contact post from an electrochemical battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other battery contact point into some other cup of the spiral. The direct battery current flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct battery current went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct battery current passed. He used acupuncture needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock.Page advocated the use of this shocking therapy device as a medical treatment known as galvanism, an early form of electrotherapy. His interest lay in heightening of electrical tension, or voltage above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors. Page went on to improve the inductive coil building a particularly effective instrument and giving it the name 'Dynamic Multiplier'. In order for Page's instrument to produce the shock, the battery current had to be stopped. In order to experience another shock, the battery had to be started again, and then stopped. This technique led Page to invent the first interrupters to provide a repeatable means of connecting and disconnecting the circuit. In these devices, electrical flow is started and stopped as a rocking or rotary motion lifts electrical contacts out of a mercury pool. An electric motor effect is responsible for the continued operation of the switch. Crucial to Page's research with the spiral conductor was his capacity to do innovating experimenting with good results. Page did not provide an explanation for what he found, yet he extended and amplified the apparatus and its unexpected behaviors. Page's publication about his spiral instrument was well received in the American science community and in England, putting him into the upper ranks of American science at the time.British experimenter William Sturgeon reprinted Page's article in his journal Annals of Electricity. Sturgeon provided an analysis of the electromagnetic effect involved; Page drew on and expanded Sturgeon's analysis in his own later work. Sturgeon devised coils that were adaptations of Page's instrument, where battery current flowed through one, inner, segment of a coil, and electrical shock was taken from the entire length of a secondary coil.Through the input from Sturgeon, as well as his own continuing researches, Page developed coil instruments that were the foundation for the eventual induction coil. These instruments had two wires. One wire, termed the primary, carried battery current; a shock was taken at the ends of the other much longer wire, termed the secondary . The primary wire was wound side by side one layer thick over an iron core; the secondary wire was wound over that several layers thick. Page developed a deep understanding of the underlying electromagnetic principles. In Page's published account of his coil, he termed it and its contact breaker the 'Compound Electro Magnet and Electrotome'. Page's patent model for this coil is on display at Smithsonian National Museum of America's History. Page invented different electrical current interrupters by mechanical means so that an induction coil would produce a high voltage from a low voltage battery. One was a mechanical vibrating interrupter where a piece of soft iron wire one eighth of an inch in diameter and three inches in length is covered with insulated copper wire. This configured apparatus device is made to vibrate rapidly between the North and South poles of a horseshoe shaped magnet. The wire bar mechanism is suspended in mid air at the edge of the magnet and well balanced. The wired bar is allowed to slightly touch the poles of the magnet giving it a spring effect. The little cups of mercury are sections of glass tubes for the input low voltage to the iron wire and the produced output higher voltage from the copper wire. The vibration regulator is the thumb screw r and can be adjusted to give a rapid vibration to the wire bar.Page put together another similar oscillating interrupter where there were two sets of winding insulated wires coiled in opposite directions around the main soft iron wire. The configuration was mounted on an axis differently than the first configuration at ninety degrees and the bottom end allowed to swing back and forth between the North and South poles of a horseshoe magnet. As it oscillated back and forth a higher voltage was produced from the output second set of wires than the low voltage of the input wires of the first set of wires connected to the battery. In other words, the first set of wires was connected to the positive and negative poles of the battery by way of the interrupter and the second set of wires not connected to anything had an amplified voltage many times that of the battery when the oscillating interrupter was active. It was the make and break of the first set of wires of low voltage that caused an electromagnetic field to be produced and collapse. The magnetic field oscillating like this of coming about and then collapsing caused an electric current to come out of the second set of wires because there is a relationship between magnetism and electricity. The action of one causes a reaction of the other and this law of physics is what Page discovered in his experiments. The voltage of the second set of wires was an amplified high voltage, compared to the low battery voltage that was connected to the first set of wires that was interrupted.  Telephone technology  Page mounted a spiral conductor rigidly between the North and South poles of a suspended horseshoe magnet in a subsequent test trial exercise. When current stopped in the spiral, a ringing tone could be heard from the magnet, which Page termed galvanic music. Two notes were heard, one was the proper natural musical tone of the magnet and the other was an octave higher. It was after studying this phenomenon that Alexander Graham Bell progressed to inventing the telephone decades later. Other electrical engineers cited Page's electro acoustic galvanic music mechanical vibrations as an important precedent for the development of telephone technology. Johann Philipp Reis constructed a telephone that produced a musical note based on Page's technology. Page first observed this ringing sound in 1837 of galvanic music that came from a horseshoe magnet when it was brought close to a coil of wire of electric current that was disconnected and then reconnected. This phenomenon of electromagnetic sound was made the subject of investigation by other scientists worldwide. They concluded that the sound was due to molecular changes produced by the alternate magnetization and demagnetization of the metal and that these sound vibrations were related to the electrical interruptions. This all led to the advancement of the telephone for voice and the musical harmonic telephone. This first electromagnetic device of a horseshoe magnet converting electric power into sound is credited to Page, which the world labeled as the Page effect. M. Froment of Paris in 1846 exhibited an instrument that analysed Page's galvanic music and that was a precursor of German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz's experiment showing an electrical impulse of a certain vibration rate sent down a telegraph wire could cause a tuning fork at a far distance to resonate at that same rhythm.  Electric motor  Page invented many other electromagnetic devices, some of which involved the electromagnetic motor. Many prototypes devised by Page were turned into products manufactured and marketed by Boston instrument maker Daniel Davis, Jr., the first American to practice in magnetic philosophical instruments, scientific instruments. One such prototype is Page's electrical reciprocating motor, with patent 10,480, the model for which is at the Smithsonian Museum. While consulting with Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Lewis Vail on the improvement of the telegraph, Page contributed to the adoption of suspended wires using a ground return and designed a signal receiver magnet. He also tested magneto electricity as a potential source for replacing steam power. He was a person of moderate means and could not devote full time to his scientific work which resulted in slow progress.  Electromagnetic locomotive  Page developed in the 1840s what he termed the Axial Engine. This instrument used an electromagnetic solenoid coil to draw an iron rod into its hollow interior. The rod's displacement opened a switch that stopped current from flowing in the coil; then being unattracted, the rod reverted out of the coil, and this cycle repeated again. The resulting reciprocating motion of the rod back and forth, into and out of the coil, was converted to rotary motion by the mechanism. After demonstrating uses of this engine to run saws and pumps, Page successfully petitioned the U.S. Senate for funds to produce an electromagnetic locomotive, based on this design.With these funds plus personal resources that took him into debt, Page built and tested the first full sized electromagnetic locomotive, preceded only by the 1842 battery powered model sized Galvani of Scottish inventor Robert Davidson. Along the way, Page constructed a series of motors, revisions of the axial engine having different dimensions and mechanical features, which he tested thoroughly. The motor operated on large electrochemical cells, acid batteries having as electrodes zinc and costly platinum, with fragile clay diaphragms between the cells. Page's 1850 American Association for Advancement of Science presentation about his progress impressed Joseph Henry, Benjamin Silliman and other leading scientists. On April 29, 1851, Page had boosted its motors from 8 to 20 HP power with 20,000 furnished by the United States government for development of an electric locomotive. Page conducted a full test, intending to run the 21,000 pound locomotive from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore and back with passengers on board with the train riding on a spur of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad track. With some periods of steady running, the nearly silent engine traveled 5 miles to Bladensburg, Maryland, at a top speed of 19 miles per hour . Prospective passengers were afraid to go on a train traveling at such a high speed.Problems came about on the inaugural trip with high voltage sparks, resulting from effects Page later investigated as problems with the spiral conductor. The sparking broke through the insulation of the electrical coils resulting in short circuits. Page and his mechanic Ari Davis struggled to keep the locomotive operating, making necessary repairs as they went along. They reversed direction once arriving at Bladensburg for what became a troublesome problematic return to Washington, D.C.The railroad vehicle was capable of carrying several passengers in addition to an operating crew. It had a wheel arrangement of 4 2 0 and constructed like an ordinary passenger rail wagon coach with a fifteen foot long arch roof and a six feet wide body. The train superstructure supported the forward truck end of the transport with four ordinary 30 inch steel wheels and the rear end was supported on two five foot high driving wheels. The woodwork of the carrier was constructed by a common house carpenter who had never seen close up a train carriage being built. The driving wheels were assembled by mechanics not used to making mechanisms that complicated so were not put together with precision and were misaligned. As a result of Page's poor engineering for the project his railway train was a shameful result unworthy of the position it was to occupy in history.The power for propelling the first all electric passenger train was furnished by one hundred Grove cell batteries carried under the carriage floor in an oblong trough between the driving wheels where the boiler and firebox were normally located in a typical train engine. The cells were 100 square inches each of a pair of electrode dividers. Many of the fragile battery cell clay dividers cracked and broke down during the jarring and shaking operation of the locomotive engine. In addition the consumption of zinc was immense, so between these two maintenance items the expense of running a battery operated locomotive was prohibitive in a commercial application.The failures of Page's electromagnetic locomotive test run were cautionary to other inventors who eventually found other means than batteries to produce electrically driven locomotion. Before Page began his attempt, work such as that of James Prescott Joule had generated a general consensus among scientists that the battery powered electric engine was an impractical device. Page had disregarded those findings and never gave up believing in the potential of his design of an on board electric source for locomotive power.  Unmasking pseudoscience Comfortable himself in public performance as a popular lecturer and singer, being skilled in ventriloquism as well, Page was astute in detecting the misuse of performative acts in defrauding a gullible public. One class of fraudulent schemes prevalent at the time involved communications with spirits by means of rapping sounds, the motion of a table, or other such signs produced in the vicinity of the perpetrator medium. The sounds and motions were attributed to occult forces and forms of electricity. The Fox sisters, of Rochester New York, made these claims notorious by exhibiting in public and private settings, while collecting money from their audiences. Page's efforts to expose these frauds at their human roots stems in part from his keen concern for furthering the public understanding of science and their proficient use of its findings and benefits. In this undertaking, Page allied with contemporary Michael Faraday and other scientists who have sought to debunk the unscrupulous applications of pseudoscience upon a willing and gullible public.Investigating some of these performers in person, Page produced a book titled Psychomancy: spirit rappings and table tippings exposed that uncovers various means of deception they employed. He described his analysis of these techniques during a sitting with the Fox sisters. Each time a critical observer peered under the table around which the sisters were seated, the spirit rapping ceased; whenever the observer sat upright, the sounds recommenced. Page asked to have the spirit sounds displayed elsewhere than via the table. One sister climbed into a wardrobe closet. Page identified where her long dress contacted the wardrobe. Through his expert knowledge of ventriloquism, Page detected how this performer was misdirecting the viewer's attention away from the actual source of the sound while building expectations to suppose the sound came from elsewhere than the source. However the trick was poorly done and the girl could not control it so as to produce any spirit communication.Going on to reveal other fraudulent practices, Page addressed the relationship at work between performer and audience by which both functioned as perpetrators. He said that the prime movers in all these so called miracles were impostors, and that those who believed them were gullible. While the former was filling their coffers at the expense of the latter, they often indulged in secret amusement at the faith of their supporters. This was particularly true at the consultations of the learned clergy and others upon electricity and magnetism considered the new fluid of the devil's immediate agency as the probable cause of these strange phenomena.  Controversy and impact from politics, war, and patents Page's scientific undertakings brought him into public arenas where politics and controversy held sway. A tension early to arise in his career as patent examiner was that of the conflict of interest between the privileged information he had regarding applicants' patents, and his private consulting with particular inventors on the side. Following his appearance in the 1848 Morse v O'Reilly lawsuit over the telegraph, Page took a more careful stance in his role as patent examiner. Thereafter, he refrained from transmitting such privileged information to rival patent applicants. However, the well paid public post of patent examiner put the occupants continually under scrutiny by politicians, scientists, and aspiring inventors. Both Congress and the executive branch exerted control and influence over policy and practices in the patent office. In the early years of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a patent examiner was expected to be highly trained, knowledgeable in all the sciences, informed on current and past technology. Page was an exemplar of this ideal and became the chief patent examiner. As Page continued in the job of senior examiner he developed a keen eye for detecting fraudulent scientific claims, although he was a patent advocate.The number of patents submitted to the agency in his time at the prestigious job increased sharply, however the number of patents granted was the same or less, and the number of patent examiners was unchanged. Inventors seeking patents, becoming incensed about decisions made against them, coalesced into a lobby with a voice projected through the journal Scientific American. This lobby advocated liberalization more leniency in the granting of patents, giving the inventor the benefit of the doubt and argued against the scientific research being sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution under Joseph Henry.Henry took a hard line, decrying inventors' futile attempts to innovate and improve . The elite professionalized science that Henry was building up through the Smithsonian and other organizations treated as low status the having or seeking of a patent; patents were not considered a contribution to science. While Page set out to show that gaining patents was genuine scientific work, he fell out of favor with the scientific establishment. His friendship with Henry petered out, and Page was no longer held in high regard as part of elite science.Page shifted in his position on the granting of patents. As an examiner of patents, he was scrupulous and fair. Through his own experience as an inventor and association with other inventors, he allied with their concerns. On his resignation from the patent agency, Page used the American Journal of Science as a forum to critique and even lambast the agency and policies which he had upheld for 10 years prior. He had played a role in shaping government customs when inside the patent office and now in reshaping the policies from an outside view.Page found a political ally in Thomas Hart Benton, senator from Missouri. Benton requested funds for Page to develop a warship powered on electromagnetism. This petition met with serious opposition in the Senate. Senator Henry Stuart Foote countered that Page had not proved substantial progress or benefits from his work. Senator Jefferson Finis Davis objected to the appropriation of government funds to one inventor, while other inventors such as Thomas Davenport went unsupported. Both the US Senate and House nixed any further funds for a Page's project.By the 1860s, the induction coil was becoming a prominent instrument of physics research. Instrument makers in America, Great Britain and the European continent contributed in developing the construction and operation of induction coils. Premiere among these instrument makers was Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, who in 1864 received from Emperor Napoleon III the prestigious Volta Prize along with a 50,000 franc award for his introduction of the induction coil. Page maintained that the devices he developed in the 1830s were not markedly different from the induction coil and that other American inventors had filled in with improvements that were better than anything made by Ruhmkorff and alleging that Ruhmkorff had plagiarized the coil of another American instrument maker, Edward Samuel Ritchie.A special act passed by the U.S. House and Senate, and signed by President Andrew Johnson authorized what was later dubbed The Page Patent . Page died a few weeks later, in May 1868. Instead of dying with him, the Page patent went on to play a major role in the politics and economics of the telegraph industry. Page's lawyer and heirs successfully argued that the patent covered the mechanisms involved in all known forms of telegraphy . An interest in the patent was sold to the Western Union Co; together Western Union and the Page heirs reaped lucrative benefits. Page's patent secured a life 'in style' for his widow and heirs. Although he was no longer living, it figured as yet another violation, on his part, of the behavior code under the emerging professionalization of science of the day, under which science was to be conducted for its own sake, without accruing apparent political or financial gain.  Personal life Page in 1843 became engaged to Priscilla Sewall Webster who was the younger sister of the wife of a Washington physician, Harvey Lindsly. Lindsly happened to be among Page's colleagues. Page married Priscilla in 1844 and the couple had a son who died in infancy. They then had three more sons and two daughters that grew to adulthood and outlived him. Their oldest daughter, Emelyn or Emmie, died less than a year after Page's own death. Their youngest son, Harvey Lindsly Page , was named for his uncle and was a famous American architect and inventor of San Antonio, Texas.Page's many contributions have slipped from the view of most historians with little remaining of his experimental work and notes. He suffered debt, terminal illness and isolation from the mainstream scientific community in his last years. Page published anonymously a lengthy, closely researched yet self promoting book titled American Claim to Induction Coil and its electrostatic developments. He died in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1868. Page's wife Priscilla died August 7, 1894.  See also Thomas Hall  References   Sources Barnard, Henry . Our Country's Wealth and Influence. L. Stebbins.

            "text": "Sir Charles Kao Kuen was an electrical engineer and physicist who pioneered the development and use of fiber optics in telecommunications. In the 1960s, Kao created various methods to combine glass fibers with lasers in order to transmit digital data, which laid the groundwork for the evolution of the Internet. Kao was born in Shanghai; his family moved to Hong Kong when he was about 15. He grew up in Taiwan and Hong Kong before moving to London to study electrical engineering. In the 1960s, Kao worked at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories, the research center of Standard Telephones and Cables in Harlow, and it was here in 1966 that he laid the groundwork for fiber optics in communication. Known as the godfather of broadband , the father of fiber optics , and the father of fiber optic communications , he continued his work in Hong Kong at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and in the United States at ITT and Yale University. Kao was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication . In 2010, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for services to fiber optic communications .A permanent resident of Hong Kong, Kao was a citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.  Early life and education Charles Kao was born in Shanghai in 1933,: 1 at that time a separate administrative area. He studied Chinese classics at home with his brother, under a tutor.: 41 He also studied English and French at the Shanghai World School in the Shanghai French Concession that was founded by a number of progressive Chinese educators, including Cai Yuanpei.Kao's family moved to Taiwan and then British Hong Kong in 1948: 1 where he completed his secondary education at St. Joseph's College in 1952. He did his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at Woolwich Polytechnic , obtaining his Bachelor of Engineering degree.: 1 He then pursued research and received his PhD in electrical engineering in 1965 from University of London, under Professor Harold Barlow of University College London as an external student while working at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories in Harlow, England, the research center of Standard Telephones and Cables.  Ancestry and family  Kao's father Kao Chun Hsiang : 13 was a lawyer who obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1925. He was a professor at Soochow University Comparative Law School of China.His grandfather Kao Hsieh was a scholar, poet, artist, and a leading figure of the South Society during the late Qing Dynasty. Several writers including Kao Hs , Yao Kuang , and Kao Tseng were also Kao's close relatives.His father's cousin was astronomer Kao Ping tse . Kao's younger brother Timothy Wu Kao is a civil engineer and Professor Emeritus at the Catholic University of America. His research is in hydrodynamics.Kao met his future wife Gwen May Wan Kao in London after graduation, when they worked together as engineers at Standard Telephones and Cables.: 23 She is British Chinese.: 17 They were married in 1959 in London,: 15 17 and had a son and a daughter, both of whom reside and work in Silicon Valley, California. According to Kao's autobiography, Kao was a Catholic who attended Catholic Church while his wife attended Anglican Communion.: 14 15  Academic career   Fiber optics and communications  In the 1960s at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories based in Harlow, Essex, England, Kao and his coworkers did their pioneering work in creating fiber optics as a telecommunications medium, by demonstrating that the high loss of existing fiber optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself.In 1963, when Kao first joined the optical communications research team he made notes summarising the background situation and available technology at the time, and identifying the key individuals involved. Initially Kao worked in the team of Antoni E. Karbowiak , who was working under Alec Reeves to study optical waveguides for communications. Kao's task was to investigate fiber attenuation, for which he collected samples from different fiber manufacturers and also investigated the properties of bulk glasses carefully. Kao's study primarily convinced him that the impurities in material caused the high light losses of those fibers. Later that year, Kao was appointed head of the electro optics research group at STL. He took over the optical communication program of STL in December 1964, because his supervisor, Karbowiak, left to take the Chair in Communications in the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of New South Wales , Sydney, Australia.Although Kao succeeded Karbowiak as manager of optical communications research, he immediately decided to abandon Karbowiak's plan and overall change research direction with his colleague George Hockham. They not only considered optical physics but also the material properties. The results were first presented by Kao to the IEE in January 1966 in London, and further published in July with George Hockham . This study first theorized and proposed to use glass fibers to implement optical communication, the ideas described are largely the basis of today's optical fiber communications. In 1965, Kao with Hockham concluded that the fundamental limitation for glass light attenuation is below 20 dB km , which is a key threshold value for optical communications. However, at the time of this determination, optical fibers commonly exhibited light loss as high as 1,000 dB km and even more. This conclusion opened the intense race to find low loss materials and suitable fibres for reaching such criteria.Kao, together with his new team , pursued this goal by testing various materials. They precisely measured the attenuation of light with different wavelengths in glasses and other materials. During this period, Kao pointed out that the high purity of fused silica made it an ideal candidate for optical communication. Kao also stated that the impurity of glass material is the main cause for the dramatic decay of light transmission inside glass fiber, rather than fundamental physical effects such as scattering as many physicists thought at that time, and such impurity could be removed. This led to a worldwide study and production of high purity glass fibers. When Kao first proposed that such glass fiber could be used for long distance information transfer and could replace copper wires which were used for telecommunication during that era, his ideas were widely disbelieved; later people realized that Kao's ideas revolutionized the whole communication technology and industry.He also played a leading role in the early stage of engineering and commercial realization of optical communication. In spring 1966, Kao traveled to the U.S. but failed to interest Bell Labs, which was a competitor of STL in communication technology at that time. He subsequently traveled to Japan and gained support. Kao visited many glass and polymer factories, discussed with various people including engineers, scientists, businessmen about the techniques and improvement of glass fiber manufacture. In 1969, Kao with M. W. Jones measured the intrinsic loss of bulk fused silica at 4 dB km, which is the first evidence of ultra transparent glass. Bell Labs started considering fiber optics seriously. As of 2017, fiber optic losses are as low as 0.1419 dB km at the 1.56 m wavelength.Kao developed important techniques and configurations for glass fiber waveguides, and contributed to the development of different fiber types and system devices which met both civil and military application requirements, and peripheral supporting systems for optical fiber communication. In mid 1970s, he did seminal work on glass fiber fatigue strength. When named the first ITT Executive Scientist, Kao launched the Terabit Technology program in addressing the high frequency limits of signal processing, so Kao is also known as the father of the terabit technology concept . Kao has published more than 100 papers and was granted over 30 patents, including the water resistant high strength fibers .At an early stage of developing optic fibers, Kao already strongly preferred single mode for long distance optical communication, instead of using multi mode systems. His vision later was followed and now is applied almost exclusively. Kao was also a visionary of modern submarine communications cables and largely promoted this idea. He predicted in 1983 that world's seas would be littered with fiber optics, five years ahead of the time that such a trans oceanic fiber optic cable first became serviceable.Ali Javan's introduction of a steady helium neon laser and Kao's discovery of fiber light loss properties now are recognized as the two essential milestones for the development of fiber optic communications.  Later work  Kao joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1970 to found the Department of Electronics, which later became the Department of Electronic Engineering. During this period, Kao was the reader and then the chair Professor of Electronics at CUHK; he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programs of electronics and oversaw the graduation of his first students. Under his leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established. He returned to ITT Corporation in 1974 in the United States and worked in Roanoke, Virginia, first as Chief Scientist and later as Director of Engineering. In 1982, he became the first ITT Executive Scientist and was stationed mainly at the Advanced Technology Center in Connecticut. While there, he served as an adjunct professor and Fellow of Trumbull College at Yale University. In 1985, Kao spent one year in West Germany, at the SEL Research Center. In 1986, Kao was the Corporate Director of Research at ITT. He was one of the earliest to study the environmental effects of land reclamation in Hong Kong, and presented one of his first related studies at the conference of the Association of Commonwealth Universities in Edinburgh in 1972.Kao was the vice chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 1987 to 1996. From 1991, Kao was an Independent Non Executive Director and a member of the Audit Committee of the Varitronix International Limited in Hong Kong. From 1993 to 1994, he was the President of the Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning . In 1996, Kao donated to Yale University, and the Charles Kao Fund Research Grants was established to support Yale's studies, research and creative projects in Asia. The fund currently is managed by Yale University Councils on East Asian and Southeast Asian Studies. After his retirement from CUHK in 1996, Kao spent his six month sabbatical leave at the Imperial College London Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering; from 1997 to 2002, he also served as visiting professor in the same department.Kao was chairman and member of the Energy Advisory Committee of Hong Kong for two years, and retired from the position on July 15, 2000. Kao was a Member of the Council of Advisors on Innovation and Technology of Hong Kong, appointed on April 20, 2000. In 2000, Kao co founded the Independent Schools Foundation Academy, which is located in Cyberport, Hong Kong. He was its founding Chairman in 2000, and stepped down from the Board of the ISF in December 2008. Kao was the keynote speaker at IEEE GLOBECOM 2002 in Taipei, Taiwan. In 2003, Kao was named a Chair Professor by special appointment at the Electronics Institute of the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National Taiwan University. Kao then worked as the chairman and CEO of Transtech Services Ltd., a telecommunication consultancy in Hong Kong. He was the founder, chairman and CEO of ITX Services Limited. From 2003 to January 30, 2009, Kao was an independent non executive director and member of the audit committee of Next Media.

The binary output in the graphic spells out 'KAO' when converted to ASCII.  Later life and death Kao's international travels led him to opine that he belonged to the world instead of any country. An open letter published by Kao and his wife in 2010 later clarified that Charles studied in Hong Kong for his high schooling, he has taught here, he was the Vice Chancellor of CUHK and retired here too. So he is a Hong Kong belonger. Pottery making was a hobby of Kao's. Kao also enjoyed reading wuxia novels.Kao suffered from Alzheimer's disease from early 2004 and had speech difficulty, but had no problem recognising people or addresses. His father suffered from the same disease. Beginning in 2008, he resided in Mountain View, California, United States, where he moved from Hong Kong in order to live near his children and grandchild.On October 6, 2009, when Kao was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the study of the transmission of light in optical fibers and for fiber communication, he said, I am absolutely speechless and never expected such an honor. Kao's wife Gwen told the press that the prize will primarily be used for Charles's medical expenses. In 2010 Charles and Gwen Kao founded the Charles K. Kao Foundation for Alzheimer's Disease to raise public awareness about the disease and provide support for the patients. In 2016, Kao lost the ability to maintain his balance. At the end stage of his dementia he was cared for by his wife and intended not to be kept alive with life support or have CPR performed on him. Kao died at Bradbury Hospice in Hong Kong on 23 September 2018 at the age of 84.  Works Optical fiber technology; by Charles K. Kao. IEEE Press, New York, USA; 1981.

            "text": "Charles Proteus Steinmetz was a German born American mathematician and electrical engineer and professor at Union College. He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible the expansion of the electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground breaking discoveries in the understanding of hysteresis that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment, especially electric motors for use in industry.At the time of his death, Steinmetz held over 200 patents. A genius in both mathematics and electronics, he did work that earned him the nicknames Forger of Thunderbolts and The Wizard of Schenectady . Steinmetz's equation, Steinmetz solids, Steinmetz curves, and Steinmetz equivalent circuit are all named after him, as are numerous honors and scholarships, including the IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award, one of the highest technical recognitions given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers professional society.  Early life and education  Steinmetz was born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz on April 9, 1865, in Breslau, Province of Silesia, Prussia the son of Caroline and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz. He was baptized as a Lutheran into the Evangelical Church of Prussia. Steinmetz, who stood only four feet tall as an adult, had dwarfism, hunchback, and hip dysplasia, as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes Gymnasium and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in mathematics and physics. Following the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the University of Breslau to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a socialist university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.  Socialism and technocracy As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to Z rich in 1888 to escape possible arrest. Cornell University Professor Ronald R. Kline, author of Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist, contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland such as being in arrears with his tuition at the university and life at home with his father, stepmother and their daughters being tension filled.Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to Charles in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name Proteus , a wise hunchbacked character from the Odyssey who knew many secrets, after a childhood epithet given by classmates Steinmetz felt suited him.Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office , and because only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today .A member of the original Technical Alliance, which also included Thorstein Veblen and Leland Olds, Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: Some day we make the good things of life for everybody .  Electrical engineering  Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of alternating current systems theory: hysteresis, steady state analysis, and transients.  AC hysteresis theory  Shortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in Yonkers, New York, and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, earning worldwide professional recognition. Eickemeyer's firm developed transformers for use in the transmission of electrical power among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed General Electric Company, where Steinmetz quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.  AC steady state circuit theory  Steinmetz's work revolutionized AC circuit theory and analysis, which had been carried out using complicated, time consuming calculus based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering , presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to a simple problem of algebra . He systematized the use of complex number phasor representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the lower case letter j is used to designate the 90 degree rotation operator in AC system analysis. His seminal books and many other AIEE papers taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena .  AC transient theory  Steinmetz also greatly advanced the understanding of lightning. His systematic experiments resulted in the first laboratory created man made lightning , earning him the nickname the Forger of Thunderbolts . These were conducted in a football field sized laboratory at General Electric, using 120,000 volt generators. He also erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning to study its patterns and effects, which resulted in several theories.  Professional life Steinmetz acted in the following professional capacities: At Union College, as chair of electrical engineering from 1902 to 1913 and as faculty member thereafter until his death in 1923 Board member on the Schenectady Board of Education for six years, including four years as the board's president President of the Common Council of Schenectady President of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1901 to 1902 First vice president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians which later became the International Municipal Signal Association from 1913 until his death in 1923.He was granted an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1901 and a doctorate from Union College in 1903.Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not exclusively about engineering. He was a member and adviser to the fraternity Phi Gamma Delta at Union College, whose chapter house was one of the first electrified residences.While serving as president of the Schenectady Board of Education, Steinmetz introduced numerous progressive reforms, including extended school hours, school meals, school nurses, special classes for the children of immigrants, and the distribution of free textbooks.  Personal life  Steinmetz was affected by kyphosis, as was his father and grandfather. In spite of his love for children and family life, Steinmetz remained unmarried, to prevent his spinal deformity from being passed to any offspring.When Joseph LeRoy Hayden, a loyal and hardworking lab assistant, announced that he would marry and look for his own living quarters, Steinmetz made the unusual proposal of opening his large home, complete with research lab, greenhouse, and office to the Haydens and their prospective family. Hayden favored the idea, but his future wife was wary of the unorthodox arrangement. She agreed after Steinmetz's assurance that she could run the house as she saw fit.After an uneasy start, the arrangement worked well for all parties, especially after three Hayden children were born. Steinmetz legally adopted Joseph Hayden as his son, becoming grandfather to the youngsters, entertaining them with fantastic stories and spectacular scientific demonstrations. The unusual, harmonious living arrangement lasted for the rest of Steinmetz's life.Steinmetz founded America's first glider club, but none of its prototypes could be dignified with the term 'flight' .Steinmetz was a lifelong agnostic. He died on October 26, 1923, and was buried in Vale Cemetery in Schenectady.  Legacy  Steinmetz earned wide recognition among the scientific community and numerous awards and honors both during his life and posthumously. Steinmetz's equation, derived from his experiments, defines the approximate heat energy due to magnetic hysteresis released, per cycle per unit volume of magnetic material. A Steinmetz solid is the solid body generated by the intersection of two or three cylinders of equal radius at right angles. Steinmetz' equivalent circuit is still widely used for the design and testing of induction machines.One of the highest technical recognitions given by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the IEEE Charles Proteus Steinmetz Award , is given for major contributions to standardization within the field of electrical and electronics engineering. Other awards include the Certificate of Merit of Franklin Institute, 1908; the Elliott Cresson Medal, 1913; and the Cedergren Medal, 1914.The Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture series was begun in his honor in 1925, sponsored by the Schenectady branch of the IEEE. Through 2017 seventy three gatherings have taken place, held almost exclusively at Union College, featuring notable figures such as Nobel laureate experimental physicist Robert A. Millikan, helicopter inventor Igor Sikorsky, nuclear submarine pioneer Admiral Hyman G. Rickover , Nobel winning semiconductor inventor William Shockley, and Internet founding father Leonard Kleinrock.Steinmetz's connection to Union is further celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium, a day long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the Union College computer center, is named after him. The Charles P. Steinmetz Scholarship is awarded annually by the college, underwritten since its inception in 1923 by the General Electric Company. An additional Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Scholarship was later established at Union by Marjorie Hayden, daughter of Joseph and Corrine Hayden, and is awarded to students majoring in engineering or physics.A 1914 Duplex Drive Brougham Detroit Electric automobile that once belonged to Steinmetz was purchased by Union College in 1971, and restored for use in campus ceremonies. The Steinmetz car is permanent displayed in the first floor corridor between the Wold Center and F.W. Olin building.A Chicago public high school, Steinmetz College Prep, is named for him, as well as a Schenectady public school, the Steinmetz Career and Leadership Academy. A public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.In 1983, the US Post Office included Steinmetz in a series of postage stamps commemorating American inventors.In May 2015, a life size bronze statue of Charles Steinmetz meeting Thomas Edison by sculptor and caster Dexter Benedict was unveiled on a plaza on the corner of Erie Boulevards and South Ferry Street in Schenectady.  In popular culture Steinmetz is featured in John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy in one of the biographies. He also serves as a major character in Starling Lawrence's The Lightning Keeper.Steinmetz is a major character in the novel Electric City by Elizabeth Rosner. Moe sarcastically refers to Curly as a Steinmetz in the 1944 Three Stooges short Busy Buddies.Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the actor Rod Steiger in the CBS television anthology series, The Joseph Cotten Show. The episode focused on his socialist activities in Germany.A famous anecdote about Steinmetz concerns a troubleshooting consultation at Henry Ford's River Rouge Plant. A humorous aspect of the story is the itemized bill he submitted for the work performed.

            "text": "Charles University , also known as Charles University in Prague or historically as the University of Prague , is the oldest and largest university in the Czech Republic. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe in continuous operation. Today, the university consists of 17 faculties located in Prague, Hradec Kr lov , and Plze . Charles University belongs among the top three universities in Central and Eastern Europe. It is ranked around 200 300 in the world.  History   Medieval university  The establishment of a medieval university in Prague was inspired by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. He asked his friend and ally, Pope Clement VI, to do so. On 26 January 1347 the pope issued the bull establishing a university in Prague, modeled on the University of Paris, with the full number of faculties, that is including a theological faculty. On 7 April 1348 Charles, the king of Bohemia, gave to the established university privileges and immunities from the secular power in a Golden Bull and on 14 January 1349 he repeated that as the King of the Romans. Most Czech sources since the 19th century encyclopedias, general histories, materials of the university itself prefer to give 1348 as the year of the founding of the university, rather than 1347 or 1349. This was caused by an anticlerical shift in the 19th century, shared by both Czechs and Germans. The university was opened in 1349. The university was sectioned into parts called nations: the Bohemian, Bavarian, Polish and Saxon. The Bohemian natio included Bohemians, Moravians, southern Slavs, and Hungarians; the Bavarian included Austrians, Swabians, natives of Franconia and of the Rhine provinces; the Polish included Silesians, Poles, Ruthenians; the Saxon included inhabitants of the Margravate of Meissen, Thuringia, Upper and Lower Saxony, Denmark, and Sweden. Ethnically Czech students made 16 20 of all students. Archbishop Arno t of Pardubice took an active part in the foundation by obliging the clergy to contribute and became a chancellor of the university . The first graduate was promoted in 1359. The lectures were held in the colleges, of which the oldest was named for the king the Carolinum, established in 1366. In 1372 the Faculty of Law became an independent university.In 1402 Jerome of Prague in Oxford copied out the Dialogus and Trialogus of John Wycliffe. The dean of the philosophical faculty, Jan Hus, translated Trialogus into the Czech language. In 1403 the university forbade its members to follow the teachings of Wycliffe, but his doctrine continued to gain in popularity. In the Western Schism, the Bohemian natio took the side of king Wenceslaus and supported the Council of Pisa . The other nationes of the university declared their support for the side of Pope Gregory XII, thus the vote was 1:3 against the Bohemians. Hus and other Bohemians, though, took advantage of Wenceslaus' opposition to Gregory. By the Decree of Kutn Hora on 18 January 1409, the king subverted the university constitution by granting the Bohemian masters three votes. Only a single vote was left for all other three nationes combined, compared to one vote per each natio before. The result of this coup was the emigration of foreign professors and students, founding the University of Leipzig in May 1409. Before that, in 1408, the university had about 200 doctors and magisters, 500 bachelors, and 30,000 students; it now lost a large part of this number, accounts of the loss varying from 5000 to 20,000 including 46 professors.In the autumn of 1409, Hus was elected rector of the now Czech dominated rump university. The standing of the university declined, and it became merely a regional institution with a very low status. Soon, in 1419, the faculties of theology and law disappeared, and only the faculty of arts remained in existence.  Protestant academy  The faculty of arts became a centre of the Hussite movement, and the chief doctrinal authority of the Utraquists. No degrees were given in the years 1417 30; at times there were only eight or nine professors. Emperor Sigismund, son of Charles IV, took what was left into his personal property and some progress was made. The emperor Ferdinand I called the Jesuits to Prague and in 1562 they opened an academy the Clementinum. From 1541 till 1558 the Czech humanist Mattheus Collinus was a professor of Greek language. Some progress was made again when the emperor Rudolph II took up residence in Prague. In 1609 the obligatory celibacy of the professors was abolished. In 1616 the Jesuit Academy became a university. Jesuits were expelled 1618 1621 during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War, which was started in Prague by anti Catholic and anti Imperial Bohemians. By 1622, the Jesuits had a predominant influence over the emperor. An Imperial decree of 19 September 1622 gave the Jesuits supreme control over the entire school system of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. The last four professors at the Carolinum resigned, and all of the Carolinum and nine colleges went to the Jesuits. The right of handing out degrees, of holding chancellorships, and of appointing the secular professors was also granted to the Jesuits.  Charles Ferdinand University  Cardinal Ernst Adalbert von Harrach actively opposed the union of the university with another institution, the withdrawal of the archiepiscopal right to the chancellorship, and prevented the drawing up of the Golden Bull for the confirmation of the grant to Jesuits. Cardinal Ernst funded the Collegium Adalbertinum, and in 1638, Emperor Ferdinand III limited the teaching monopoly enjoyed by the Jesuits. He took from them the rights, properties and archives of the Carolinum making the university once more independent under an imperial protector. During the last years of the Thirty Years' War the Charles Bridge in Prague was courageously defended by students of the Carolinum and Clementinum. Since 1650, those who received any degrees took an oath to maintain the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, which has been renewed annually. On 23 February 1654 emperor Ferdinand III merged Carolinum and Clementinum and created a single university with four faculties Charles Ferdinand University. Carolinum had at that time only the faculty of arts, as the only faculty surviving the period of the Hussite Wars. Starting at this time, the university designated itself Charles Ferdinand University . The dilapidated Carolinum was rebuilt in 1718 at the expense of the state. The rebuilding and the bureaucratic reforms of universities in the Habsburg monarchy in 1752 and 1754 deprived the university of many of its former privileges. In 1757 a Dominican and an Augustinian were appointed to give theological instruction. However, there was a gradual introduction of enlightened reforms, and this process culminated at the end of the century when even non Catholics were granted the right to study. On 29 July 1784, German replaced Latin as the language of instruction. For the first time Protestants were allowed, and soon after Jews. The university acknowledged the need for a Czech language and literature chair. Emperor Leopold II established it by a courtly decree on 28 October 1791. On 15 May 1792, scholar and historian Franz Martin Pelzel was named the professor of the chair. He started his lectures on 13 March 1793.In the revolution of 1848, German and Czech students fought for the addition of the Czech language at the Charles Ferdinand University as a language of lectures. Due to the demographic changes of the 19th century, Prague ceased to have a German language majority around 1860. By 1863, 22 lecture courses were held in Czech, the remainder in German. In 1864, Germans suggested the creation of a separate Czech university. Czech professors rejected this because they did not wish to lose the continuity of university traditions.  Split into Czech and German universities  It soon became clear that neither the German speaking Bohemians nor the Czechs were satisfied with the bilingual arrangement that the university arranged after the revolutions of 1848. The Czechs also refused to support the idea of the reinstitution of the 1349 student nations, instead declaring their support for the idea of keeping the university together, but dividing it into separate colleges, one German and one Czech. This would allow both Germans and Czechs to retain the collective traditions of the university. German speakers, however, quickly vetoed this proposal, preferring a pure German university: they proposed to split Charles Ferdinand University into two separate institutions. After long negotiations, Charles Ferdinand was divided into a German Charles Ferdinand University and a Czech Charles Ferdinand University by an act of the Cisleithanian Imperial Council, which Emperor Franz Joseph sanctioned on 28 February 1882. Each section was entirely independent of the other, and enjoyed equal status. The two universities shared medical and scientific institutes, the old insignia, aula, library, and botanical garden, but common facilities were administrated by the German University. The first rector of the Czech University became V clav Vladivoj Tomek. In 1890, the Royal and Imperial Czech Charles Ferdinand University had 112 teachers and 2,191 students and the Royal and Imperial German Charles Ferdinand University had 146 teachers and 1,483 students. Both universities had three faculties; the Theological Faculty remained the common until 1891, when it was divided as well. In the winter semester of 1909 10 the German Charles Ferdinand University had 1,778 students; these were divided into: 58 theological students, for both the secular priesthood and religious orders; 755 law students; 376 medical; 589 philosophical. Among the students were about 80 women. The professors were divided as follows: theology, 7 regular professors, 1 assistant professor, 1 docent; law, 12 regular professors, 2 assistant professors, 4 docents; medicine, 15 regular professors, 19 assistant, 30 docents; philosophy, 30 regular professors, 8 assistant, 19 docents, 7 lecturers. The Czech Charles Ferdinand University in the winter semester of 1909 10 included 4,319 students; of these 131 were theological students belonging both to the secular and regular clergy; 1,962 law students; 687 medical; 1,539 philosophical; 256 students were women. The professors were divided as follows: theological faculty, 8 regular professors, 2 docents; law, 12 regular, 7 assistant professors, 12 docents; medicine, 16 regular professors, 22 assistant, 24 docents; philosophy, 29 regular, 16 assistant, 35 docents, 11 lecturers.The high point of the German University was the era preceding the First World War, when it was home to world renowned scientists such as physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach, Moritz Winternitz and Albert Einstein. In addition, the German language students included prominent individuals such as future writers Max Brod, Franz Kafka, and Johannes Urzidil. The Lese und Redehalle der deutschen Studenten in Prag , founded in 1848, was an important social and scientific centre. Their library contained in 1885 more than 23,519 books and offered 248 scientific journals, 19 daily newspapers, 49 periodicals and 34 papers of entertainment. Regular lectures were held to scientific and political themes. Even before the Austro Hungarian Empire was abolished in late 1918, to be succeeded by Czechoslovakia, Czech politicians demanded that the insignia of 1348 were exclusively to be kept by the Czech university. The Act No. 197 1919 Sb. z. a n. established the Protestant Theological Faculty, but not as a part of the Charles University. In 1920, the so called Lex Mare was issued, named for its initiator, professor of physiology Franti ek Mare , which determined that the Czech university was to be the successor to the original university. Dropping the Habsburg name Ferdinand, it designated itself Charles University, while the German university was not named in the document, and then became officially called the German University in Prague .In 1921 the German speaking Bohemians considered moving their university to Liberec , in northern Bohemia. In 1930, about 42,000 inhabitants of Prague spoke German as their native language, while millions lived in northern, southern and western Bohemia, in Czech Silesia and parts of Moravia near the borders with Austria and Germany. In October 1932, after Naegle's death, the Czechs started again a controversy over the insignia. Ethnic tensions intensified, although some professors of the German University were members of the Czechoslovak government. Any agreement to use the insignia for both the universities was rejected. On 21 November 1934, the German University had to hand over the insigniae to the Czechs. The German University senate sent a delegation to Minister of Education Kr m to protest the writ. At noon on 24 November 1934, several thousand students of the Czech University protested in front of the German university building. The Czech rector Karel Domin gave a speech urging the crowd to attack, while the outnumbered German students tried to resist. Under the threat of violence, on 25 November 1934 rector Otto Grosser handed over the insigniae. These troubles of 1934 harmed relations between the two universities and nationalities. The tide turned in 1938 when, following the Munich Agreement, German troops entered the border areas of Czechoslovakia , as did Polish and Hungarian troops elsewhere. On 15 March 1939 Germans forced Czecho Slovakia to split apart and the Czech lands were occupied by Nazis as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Reichsprotektor Konstantin von Neurath handed the historical insigniae to the German University, which was officially renamed Deutsche Karls Universit t in Prag. On 1 September 1939 the German University was subordinated to the Reich Ministry of Education in Berlin and on 4 November 1939 it was proclaimed to be Reichsuniversit t.On 28 October 1939, during a demonstration, Jan Opletal was shot. His burial on 15 November 1939 became another demonstration. On 17 November 1939 the Czech University and all other Czech institutions of higher learning were closed, remaining closed until the end of the War. Nine student leaders were executed and about 1,200 Czech students were interned in Sachsenhausen and not released until 1943. About 20 or 35 interned students died in the camp. On 8 May 1940 the Czech University was officially renamed Czech Charles University by government regulation 188 1940 Coll. World War II marks the end of the coexistence of the two universities in Prague. In 1945 the insignia of the university were stolen by the Nazis. None of these historical objects have been found to this day.  Present day university  Although the university began to recover rapidly after 1945, it did not enjoy academic freedom for long. After the communist coup in 1948, the new regime started to arrange purges and repress all forms of disagreement with the official ideology, and continued to do so for the next four decades, with the second wave of purges during the normalization period in the beginning of the 1970s. Only in the late 1980s did the situation start to improve; students organized various activities and several peaceful demonstrations in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989 abroad. This initiated the Velvet Revolution in 1989, in which both students and faculty of the university played a large role. V clav Havel, a writer, dramatist and philosopher, was recruited from the independent academic community and appointed president of the republic in December 1989.  Location Charles University does not have one joint campus. The academic facilities occupy many locations throughout the city of Prague and three of the faculties are located in other cities . The historical main building from the 14th century called Carolinum is situated in the Old Town of Prague and constitutes the university's center. It is the seat of the rector and of the Academic Senate of Charles university. Carolinum is also the venue for official academic ceremonies such as matriculations or graduations. Its academic publishing house is Karolinum Press and the university also operates several museums. The Botanical Garden of Charles University, maintained by its Faculty of Science, is located in the New Town.  Organisation   Faculties  Among the four original faculties of Charles University were: the faculty of law, medicine, art and theology .

            "text": "Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS FRSE DCL LLD , was an English scientist and inventor of many scientific breakthroughs of the Victorian era, including the English concertina, the stereoscope , and the Playfair cipher . However, Wheatstone is best known for his contributions in the development of the Wheatstone bridge, originally invented by Samuel Hunter Christie, which is used to measure an unknown electrical resistance, and as a major figure in the development of telegraphy.  Life Charles Wheatstone was born in Barnwood, Gloucestershire. His father, W. Wheatstone, was a music seller in the town, who moved to 128 Pall Mall, London, four years later, becoming a teacher of the flute. Charles, the second son, went to a village school, near Gloucester, and afterwards to several institutions in London. One of them was in Kennington, and kept by a Mrs. Castlemaine, who was astonished at his rapid progress. From another he ran away, but was captured at Windsor, not far from the theatre of his practical telegraph. As a boy he was very shy and sensitive, liking well to retire into an attic, without any other company than his own thoughts. When he was about fourteen years old he was apprenticed to his uncle and namesake, a maker and seller of musical instruments at 436 Strand, London; but he showed little taste for handicraft or business, and loved better to study books. His father encouraged him in this, and finally took him out of the uncle's charge. At the age of fifteen, Wheatstone translated French poetry, and wrote two songs, one of which was given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew's composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. He often visited an old book stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science. One day, to the surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he could buy a dictionary. Then he began to read the volume, and, with the help of his elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home made battery, in the scullery behind his father's house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, 'We must use the pennies themselves,' said he, and the battery was soon complete. At Christchurch, Marylebone, on 12 February 1847, Wheatstone was married to Emma West. She was the daughter of a Taunton tradesman, and of handsome appearance. She died in 1866, leaving a family of five young children to his care. His domestic life was quiet and uneventful. Though silent and reserved in public, Wheatstone was a clear and voluble talker in private, if taken on his favourite studies, and his small but active person, his plain but intelligent countenance, was full of animation. Sir Henry Taylor tells us that he once observed Wheatstone at an evening party in Oxford earnestly holding forth to Lord Palmerston on the capabilities of his telegraph. 'You don't say so!' exclaimed the statesman. 'I must get you to tell that to the Lord Chancellor.' And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape. A reminiscence of this interview may have prompted Palmerston to remark that a time was coming when a minister might be asked in Parliament if war had broken out in India, and would reply, 'Wait a minute; I'll just telegraph to the Governor General, and let you know.' Wheatstone was knighted in 1868, after his completion of the automatic telegraph. He had previously been made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Some thirty four distinctions and diplomas of home or foreign societies bore witness to his scientific reputation. Since 1836 he had been a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1859 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1873 a Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences. The same year he was awarded the Ampere Medal by the French Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. In 1875 he was created an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was a D.C.L. of Oxford and an LL.D. of Cambridge. While on a visit to Paris during the autumn of 1875, and engaged in perfecting his receiving instrument for submarine cables, he caught a cold, which produced inflammation of the lungs, an illness from which he died in Paris, on 19 October 1875 aged 73. A memorial service was held in the Anglican Chapel, Paris, and attended by a deputation of the Academy. His remains were taken to his home in Park Crescent, London, and buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.  Music instruments and acoustics In September 1821, Wheatstone brought himself into public notice by exhibiting the 'Enchanted Lyre,' or 'Acoucryptophone,' at a music shop at Pall Mall and in the Adelaide Gallery. It consisted of a mimic lyre hung from the ceiling by a cord, and emitting the strains of several instruments the piano, harp, and dulcimer. In reality it was a mere sounding box, and the cord was a steel rod that conveyed the vibrations of the music from the several instruments which were played out of sight and ear shot. At this period Wheatstone made numerous experiments on sound and its transmission. Some of his results are preserved in Thomson's Annals of Philosophy for 1823. He recognised that sound is propagated by waves or oscillations of the atmosphere, as light was then believed to be by undulations of the luminiferous ether. Water, and solid bodies, such as glass, or metal, or sonorous wood, convey the modulations with high velocity, and he conceived the plan of transmitting sound signals, music, or speech to long distances by this means. He estimated that sound would travel 200 miles per second through solid rods, and proposed to telegraph from London to Edinburgh in this way. He even called his arrangement a 'telephone.' A writer in the Repository of Arts for 1 September 1821, in referring to the 'Enchanted Lyre,' beholds the prospect of an opera being performed at the King's Theatre, and enjoyed at the Hanover Square Rooms, or even at the Horns Tavern, Kennington. The vibrations are to travel through underground conductors, like to gas in pipes. And if music be capable of being thus conducted,' he observes, 'perhaps the words of speech may be susceptible of the same means of propagation. The eloquence of counsel, the debates of Parliament, instead of being read the next day only, But we shall lose ourselves in the pursuit of this curious subject.Besides transmitting sounds to a distance, Wheatstone devised a simple instrument for augmenting feeble sounds, to which he gave the name of 'Microphone.' It consisted of two slender rods, which conveyed the mechanical vibrations to both ears, and is quite different from the electrical microphone of Professor Hughes. In 1823, his uncle, the musical instrument maker, died, and Wheatstone, with his elder brother, William, took over the business. Charles had no great liking for the commercial part, but his ingenuity found a vent in making improvements on the existing instruments, and in devising philosophical toys. He also invented instruments of his own. One of the most famous was the Wheatstone concertina. It was a six sided instrument with 64 keys. These keys provided for simple chromatic fingerings. The English Concertina became increasingly famous throughout his lifetime, however it didn't reach its peak of popularity until the early 20th century. In 1827, Wheatstone introduced his 'kaleidophone', a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It consists of a metal rod, carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a 'spot' of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in the air, like a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines. In 1828, Wheatstone improved the German wind instrument, called the Mundharmonika, until it became the popular concertina, patented on 19 December 1829. The portable harmonium is another of his inventions, which gained a prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He also improved the speaking machine of De Kempelen, and endorsed the opinion of Sir David Brewster, that before the end of this century a singing and talking apparatus would be among the conquests of science. In 1834, Wheatstone, who had won a name for himself, was appointed to the Chair of Experimental Physics in King's College London. His first course of lectures on sound were a complete failure, due to his abhorrence of public speaking. In the rostrum he was tongue tied and incapable, sometimes turning his back on the audience and mumbling to the diagrams on the wall. In the laboratory he felt himself at home, and ever after confined his duties mostly to demonstration.  Velocity of electricity He achieved renown by a great experiment made in 1834 the measurement of the velocity of electricity in a wire. He cut the wire at the middle, to form a gap which a spark might leap across, and connected its ends to the poles of a Leyden jar filled with electricity. Three sparks were thus produced, one at each end of the wire, and another at the middle. He mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch, so that it revolved at a high velocity, and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it. The points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous, their reflections would appear in one straight line; but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others, because it was an instant later. The electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle. This time was found by measuring the amount of lag, and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror. Having got the time, he had only to compare that with the length of half the wire, and he could find the velocity of electricity. His results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second, i.e. faster than what we now know to be the speed of light , but were nonetheless an interesting approximation. It was already appreciated by some scientists that the velocity of electricity was dependent on the properties of the conductor and its surroundings. Francis Ronalds had observed signal retardation in his buried electric telegraph cable in 1816 and outlined its cause to be induction. Wheatstone witnessed these experiments as a youth, which were apparently a stimulus for his own research in telegraphy. Decades later, after the telegraph had been commercialised, Michael Faraday described how the velocity of an electric field in a submarine wire, coated with insulator and surrounded with water, is only 144,000 miles per second , or still less. Wheatstone's device of the revolving mirror was afterwards employed by L on Foucault and Hippolyte Fizeau to measure the velocity of light.  Spectroscopy Wheatstone and others also contributed to early spectroscopy through the discovery and exploitation of spectral emission lines.As John Munro wrote in 1891, In 1835, at the Dublin meeting of the British Association, Wheatstone showed that when metals were volatilised in the electric spark, their light, examined through a prism, revealed certain rays which were characteristic of them. Thus the kind of metals which formed the sparking points could be determined by analysing the light of the spark. This suggestion has been of great service in spectrum analysis, and as applied by Robert Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, and others, has led to the discovery of several new elements, such as rubidium and thallium, as well as increasing our knowledge of the heavenly bodies.  Telegraph Wheatstone abandoned his idea of transmitting intelligence by the mechanical vibration of rods, and took up the electric telegraph. In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from Mr William Fothergill Cooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future.  Cooperation with Cooke  Mr. Cooke was an officer in the Madras Army, who, being home on leave, was attending some lectures on anatomy at the University of Heidelberg, where, on 6 March 1836, he witnessed a demonstration with the telegraph of professor Georg Wilhelm Munke, and was so impressed with its importance, that he forsook his medical studies and devoted all his efforts to the work of introducing the telegraph. He returned to London soon after, and was able to exhibit a telegraph with three needles in January 1837. Feeling his want of scientific knowledge, he consulted Michael Faraday and Peter Mark Roget , the latter of whom sent him to Wheatstone. At a second interview, Mr. Cooke told Wheatstone of his intention to bring out a working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object was to make a fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a needle into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork. The five needle telegraph, which was mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, was similar to that of Schilling, and based on the principle enunciated by Andr Marie Amp re that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon it in such a way that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.  Early installations  An experimental line, with a sixth return wire, was run between the Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance was only one and a half mile , but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It was late in the evening before the trial took place. Mr Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Mr Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied, and 'never' said Wheatstone, 'did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.' In spite of this trial, however, the directors of the railway treated the 'new fangled' invention with indifference, and requested its removal. In July 1839, however, it was favoured by the Great Western Railway, and a line erected from the Paddington station terminus to West Drayton railway station, a distance of thirteen miles . Part of the wire was laid underground at first, but subsequently all of it was raised on posts along the line. Their circuit was eventually extended to Slough in 1841, and was publicly exhibited at Paddington as a marvel of science, which could transmit fifty signals a distance of 280,000 miles per minute . The price of admission was a shilling , and in 1844 one fascinated observer recorded the following: It is perfect from the terminus of the Great Western as far as Slough that is, eighteen miles; the wires being in some places underground in tubes, and in others high up in the air, which last, he says, is by far the best plan. We asked if the weather did not affect the wires, but he said not; a violent thunderstorm might ring a bell, but no more. We were taken into a small room where were several wooden cases containing different sorts of telegraphs. In one sort every word was spelt, and as each letter was placed in turn in a particular position, the machinery caused the electric fluid to run down the line, where it made the letter show itself at Slough, by what machinery he could not undertake to explain. After each word came a sign from Slough, signifying I understand , coming certainly in less than one second from the end of the word......Another prints the messages it brings, so that if no one attended to the bell,....the message would not be lost. This is effected by the electrical fluid causing a little hammer to strike the letter which presents itself, the letter which is raised hits some manifold writing paper , by which means the impression is left on white paper beneath. This was the most ingenious of all, and apparently Mr. Wheatstone's favourite; he was very good natured in explaining but understands it so well himself that he cannot feel how little we know about it, and goes too fast for such ignorant folk to follow him in everything. Mrs Drummond told me he is wonderful for the rapidity with which he thinks and his power of invention; he invents so many things that he cannot put half his ideas into execution, but leaves them to be picked up and used by others, who get the credit of them.  Public attention and success  The public took to the new invention after the capture of the murderer John Tawell, who in 1845, had become the first person to be arrested as the result of telecommunications technology. In the same year, Wheatstone introduced two improved forms of the apparatus, namely, the 'single' and the 'double' needle instruments, in which the signals were made by the successive deflections of the needles. Of these, the single needle instrument, requiring only one wire, is still in use.The development of the telegraph may be gathered from two facts. In 1855, the death of the Emperor Nicholas at St. Petersburg, about one o'clock in the afternoon, was announced in the House of Lords a few hours later. The result of The Oaks of 1890 was received in New York fifteen seconds after the horses passed the winning post.  Differences with Cooke  In 1841 a difference arose between Cooke and Wheatstone as to the share of each in the honour of inventing the telegraph. The question was submitted to the arbitration of the famous engineer, Marc Isambard Brunel, on behalf of Cooke, and Professor Daniell, of King's College, the inventor of the Daniell battery, on the part of Wheatstone. They awarded to Cooke the credit of having introduced the telegraph as a useful undertaking which promised to be of national importance, and to Wheatstone that of having by his researches prepared the public to receive it. They concluded with the words: 'It is to the united labours of two gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance that we must attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has made during five years since they have been associated.' The decision, however vague, pronounces the needle telegraph a joint production. If it had mainly been invented by Wheatstone, it was chiefly introduced by Cooke. Their respective shares in the undertaking might be compared to that of an author and his publisher, but for the fact that Cooke himself had a share in the actual work of invention.  Further work on telegraphs  From 1836 7 Wheatstone had thought a good deal about submarine telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, with the assistance of Mr. J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of insulated wire in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of gutta percha for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel. In 1840 Wheatstone had patented an alphabetical telegraph, or, 'Wheatstone A B C instrument,' which moved with a step by step motion, and showed the letters of the message upon a dial. The same principle was used in his type printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper. The introduction of the telegraph had so far advanced that, on 2 September 1845, the Electric Telegraph Company was registered, and Wheatstone, by his deed of partnership with Cooke, received a sum of 33,000 for the use of their joint inventions. In 1859 Wheatstone was appointed by the Board of Trade to report on the subject of the Atlantic cables, and in 1864 he was one of the experts who advised the Atlantic Telegraph Company on the construction of the successful lines of 1865 and 1866. In 1870 the electric telegraph lines of the United Kingdom, worked by different companies, were transferred to the Post Office, and placed under Government control. Wheatstone further invented the automatic transmitter, in which the signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper , which is then passed through the sending key, and controls the signal currents. By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, he was able to telegraph about 100 words a minute, or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute, and even of 400 words a minute between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Mr. Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin's le Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Mr. Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system is often referred to as the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market ticker tape.  Optics  Stereopsis was first described by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses. The 'pseudoscope' was introduced in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust appears to be a mask, and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing inside the room. Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.  Measuring time In 1840, Wheatstone introduced his chronoscope, for measuring minute intervals of time, which was used in determining the speed of a bullet or the passage of a star. In this apparatus an electric current actuated an electro magnet, which noted the instant of an occurrence by means of a pencil on a moving paper. It is said to have been capable of distinguishing 1 7300 part of a second , and the time a body took to fall from a height of one inch . On 26 November 1840, he exhibited his electro magnetic clock in the library of the Royal Society, and propounded a plan for distributing the correct time from a standard clock to a number of local timepieces. The circuits of these were to be electrified by a key or contact maker actuated by the arbour of the standard, and their hands corrected by electro magnetism. The following January Alexander Bain took out a patent for an electro magnetic clock, and he subsequently charged Wheatstone with appropriating his ideas. It appears that Bain worked as a mechanist to Wheatstone from August to December 1840, and he asserted that he had communicated the idea of an electric clock to Wheatstone during that period; but Wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during May. Bain further accused Wheatstone of stealing his idea of the electro magnetic printing telegraph; but Wheatstone showed that the instrument was only a modification of his own electro magnetic telegraph. In 1840, Alexander Bain mentioned to the Mechanics Magazine editor his financial problems. The editor introduced him to Sir Charles Wheatstone. Bain demonstrated his models to Wheatstone, who, when asked for his opinion, said Oh, I shouldn't bother to develop these things any further! There's no future in them. Three months later Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his own invention. However, Bain had already applied for a patent for it. Wheatstone tried to block Bain's patents, but failed. When Wheatstone organised an Act of Parliament to set up the Electric Telegraph Company, the House of Lords summoned Bain to give evidence, and eventually compelled the company to pay Bain 10,000 and give him a job as manager, causing Wheatstone to resign.  Polar clock  One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' exhibited at the meeting of the British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole that is, parallel to the Earth's axis and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875 1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.  Wheatstone bridge In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an important paper to the Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still goes by the name of Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice.His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains , and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.  Cryptography Wheatstone's remarkable ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of ciphers. He was responsible for the then unusual Playfair cipher, named after his friend Lord Playfair. It was used by the militaries of several nations through at least World War I, and is known to have been used during World War II by British intelligence services.It was initially resistant to cryptanalysis, but methods were eventually developed to break it. He also became involved in the interpretation of cipher manuscripts in the British Museum. He devised a cryptograph or machine for turning a message into cipher which could only be interpreted by putting the cipher into a corresponding machine adjusted to decrypt it. As an amateur mathematician, Wheatstone published a mathematical proof in 1854 .  Electrical generators In 1840, Wheatstone brought out his magneto electric machine for generating continuous currents. On 4 February 1867, he published the principle of reaction in the dynamo electric machine by a paper to the Royal Society; but Mr. C. W. Siemens had communicated the identical discovery ten days earlier, and both papers were read on the same day. It afterwards appeared that Werner von Siemens, Samuel Alfred Varley, and Wheatstone had independently arrived at the principle within a few months of each other. Varley patented it on 24 December 1866; Siemens called attention to it on 17 January 1867; and Wheatstone exhibited it in action at the Royal Society on the above date.  Disputes over invention Wheatstone was involved in various disputes with other scientists throughout his life regarding his role in different technologies and appeared at times to take more credit than he was due. As well as William Fothergill Cooke, Alexander Bain and David Brewster, mentioned above, these also included Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory. Wheatstone was erroneously believed by many to have created the atmospheric electricity observing apparatus that Ronalds invented and developed at the observatory in the 1840s and also to have installed the first automatic recording meteorological instruments there .  Personal life  Wheatstone married Emma West, spinster, a daughter of John Hooke West, deceased, at Christ Church, Marylebone, on 12 February 1847. The marriage was by licence.

            "text": "Chicago shih KAH goh, locally also shih KAW goh is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Illinois and the third most populous in the United States, after New York City and Los Angeles. With a population of 2,746,388 in the 2020 census, it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United States. As the seat of Cook County , the city is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area, one of the largest in the world. On the shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed. It grew rapidly in the mid 19th century; by 1860, Chicago was the youngest U.S. city to exceed a population of 100,000. The Great Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, but Chicago's population continued to grow to 503,000 by 1880 and then doubled to more than a million within the decade. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after the fire, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world. Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new construction styles .Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of Trade, which today is part of the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world, generating 20 of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone. O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked among the world's top six busiest airports according to tracked data by the Airports Council International. The region also has the largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad hub. The Chicago area has one of the highest gross domestic products in the world, generating 689 billion in 2018. The economy of Chicago is diverse, with no single industry employing more than 14 of the workforce. It is home to several Fortune 500 companies, including Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie, Allstate, Archer Daniels Midland, Conagra Brands, Exelon, JLL, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Mondelez International, Motorola Solutions, Sears, United Airlines Holdings, and US Foods, although the city has experienced an exodus of large corporations since 2020.Chicago's 58 million tourist visitors in 2018 set a new record. Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, the Willis Tower, Grant Park, the Museum of Science and Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. Chicago is also home to the Barack Obama Presidential Center being built in Hyde Park on the city's South Side. Chicago's culture includes the visual arts, literature, film, theater, comedy , food, dance , and music . Chicago is also the location of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Of the area's colleges and universities, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago are classified as highest research doctoral universities. Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues, including two Major League Baseball teams.  Etymology and nicknames  The name Chicago is derived from a French rendering of the indigenous Miami Illinois word shikaakwa for a wild relative of the onion; it is known to botanists as Allium tricoccum and known more commonly as ramps . The first known reference to the site of the current city of Chicago as Checagou was by Robert de LaSalle around 1679 in a memoir. Henri Joutel, in his journal of 1688, noted that the eponymous wild garlic grew abundantly in the area. According to his diary of late September 1687: ... when we arrived at the said place called Chicagou which, according to what we were able to learn of it, has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region. The city has had several nicknames throughout its history, such as the Windy City, Chi Town, Second City, and City of the Big Shoulders.  History   Beginnings  In the mid 18th century, the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi, a Native American tribe who had succeeded the Miami and Sauk and Fox peoples in this region.The first known non indigenous permanent settler in Chicago was trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. Du Sable was of African descent, perhaps born in the French colony of Saint Domingue , and established the settlement in the 1780s. He is commonly known as the Founder of Chicago .In 1795, following the victory of the new United States in the Northwest Indian War, an area that was to be part of Chicago was turned over to the US for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the Treaty of Greenville. In 1803, the U.S. Army constructed Fort Dearborn, which was destroyed during the War of 1812 in the Battle of Fort Dearborn by the Potawatomi before being later rebuilt.After the War of 1812, the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the United States in the 1816 Treaty of St. Louis. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the 1833 Treaty of Chicago and sent west of the Mississippi River as part of the federal policy of Indian removal.  19th century  On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a population of about 200. Within seven years it grew to more than 6,000 people. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales began with Edmund Dick Taylor as Receiver of Public Monies. The City of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837, and for several decades was the world's fastest growing city.As the site of the Chicago Portage, the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western United States. Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, and the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. The canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the Mississippi River.A flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad. Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant, influencing the American economy. The Chicago Board of Trade listed the first ever standardized exchange traded forward contracts, which were called futures contracts.In the 1850s, Chicago gained national political prominence as the home of Senator Stephen Douglas, the champion of the Kansas Nebraska Act and the popular sovereignty approach to the issue of the spread of slavery. These issues also helped propel another Illinoisan, Abraham Lincoln, to the national stage. Lincoln was nominated in Chicago for US president at the 1860 Republican National Convention, which was held in a purpose built auditorium called, the Wigwam. He defeated Douglas in the general election, and this set the stage for the American Civil War. To accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation, the city improved its infrastructure. In February 1856, Chicago's Common Council approved Chesbrough's plan to build the United States' first comprehensive sewerage system. The project raised much of central Chicago to a new grade with the use of jackscrews for raising buildings. While elevating Chicago, and at first improving the city's health, the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the Chicago River, and subsequently into Lake Michigan, polluting the city's primary freshwater source. The city responded by tunneling two miles out into Lake Michigan to newly built water cribs. In 1900, the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the Mississippi River. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed an area about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide, a large section of the city at the time. Much of the city, including railroads and stockyards, survived intact, and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone. These set a precedent for worldwide construction. During its rebuilding period, Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using steel skeleton construction.The city grew significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city, including the Hyde Park Township, which now comprises most of the South Side of Chicago and the far southeast of Chicago, and the Jefferson Township, which now makes up most of Chicago's Northwest Side. The desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents. Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States. Of the total population in 1900, more than 77 were either foreign born or born in the United States of foreign parentage. Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes, and Czechs made up nearly two thirds of the foreign born population .Labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the Pullman Strike. Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions. Concern for social problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr to found Hull House in 1889. Programs that were developed there became a model for the new field of social work. During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later, state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever were both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states.The city established many large, well landscaped municipal parks, which also included public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving public health in Chicago was Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D. Rauch established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.In the 1800s, Chicago became the nation's railroad hub, and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. In 1883, Chicago's railway managers needed a general time convention, so they developed the standardized system of North American time zones. This system for telling time spread throughout the continent. In 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition on former marshland at the present location of Jackson Park. The Exposition drew 27.5 million visitors, and is considered the most influential world's fair in history. The University of Chicago, formerly at another location, moved to the same South Side location in 1892. The term midway for a fair or carnival referred originally to the Midway Plaisance, a strip of park land that still runs through the University of Chicago campus and connects the Washington and Jackson Parks.  20th and 21st centuries   1900 to 1939  During World War I and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from the Southern United States. Between 1910 and 1930, the African American population of Chicago increased dramatically, from 44,103 to 233,903. This Great Migration had an immense cultural impact, called the Chicago Black Renaissance, part of the New Negro Movement, in art, literature, and music. Continuing racial tensions and violence, such as the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, also occurred.The ratification of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of a rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.Chicago was the first American city to have a homosexual rights organization. The organization, formed in 1924, was called the Society for Human Rights. It produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. Police and political pressure caused the organization to disband.The Great Depression brought unprecedented suffering to Chicago, in no small part due to the city's heavy reliance on heavy industry. Notably, industrial areas on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the Chicago River were devastated; by 1933 over 50 of industrial jobs in the city had been lost, and unemployment rates amongst blacks and Mexicans in the city were over 40 . The Republican political machine in Chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis, and every mayor since 1931 has been a Democrat. From 1928 to 1933, the city witnessed a tax revolt, and the city was unable to meet payroll or provide relief efforts. The fiscal crisis was resolved by 1933, and at the same time, federal relief funding began to flow into Chicago. Chicago was also a hotbed of labor activism, with Unemployed Councils contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity for the poor and demand relief, these organizations were created by socialist and communist groups. By 1935 the Workers Alliance of America begun organizing the poor, workers, the unemployed. In the spring of 1937 Republic Steel Works witnessed the Memorial Day massacre of 1937 in the neighborhood of East Side. In 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was fatally wounded in Miami, Florida, during a failed assassination attempt on President elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1933 and 1934, the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the Century of Progress International Exposition World's Fair. The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago's founding.  1940 to 1979  During World War II, the city of Chicago alone produced more steel than the United Kingdom every year from 1939 1945, and more than Nazi Germany from 1943 1945.The Great Migration, which had been on pause due to the Depression, resumed at an even faster pace in the second wave, as hundreds of thousands of blacks from the South arrived in the city to work in the steel mills, railroads, and shipping yards.On December 2, 1942, physicist Enrico Fermi conducted the world's first controlled nuclear reaction at the University of Chicago as part of the top secret Manhattan Project. This led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the United States, which it used in World War II in 1945.Mayor Richard J. Daley, a Democrat, was elected in 1955, in the era of machine politics. In 1956, the city conducted its last major expansion when it annexed the land under O'Hare airport, including a small portion of DuPage County. By the 1960s, white residents in several neighborhoods left the city for the suburban areas in many American cities, a process known as white flight as Blacks continued to move beyond the Black Belt. While home loan discriminatory redlining against blacks continued, the real estate industry practiced what became known as blockbusting, completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods. Structural changes in industry, such as globalization and job outsourcing, caused heavy job losses for lower skilled workers. At its peak during the 1960s, some 250,000 workers were employed in the steel industry in Chicago, but the steel crisis of the 1970s and 1980s reduced this number to just 28,000 in 2015. In 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. and Albert Raby led the Chicago Freedom Movement, which culminated in agreements between Mayor Richard J. Daley and the movement leaders.Two years later, the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall, with anti war protesters, journalists and bystanders being beaten by police. Major construction projects, including the Sears Tower , University of Illinois at Chicago, McCormick Place, and O'Hare International Airport, were undertaken during Richard J. Daley's tenure. In 1979, Jane Byrne, the city's first female mayor, was elected. She was notable for temporarily moving into the crime ridden Cabrini Green housing project and for leading Chicago's school system out of a financial crisis.  1980 to present  In 1983, Harold Washington became the first black mayor of Chicago. Washington's first term in office directed attention to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods. He was re elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack soon after. Washington was succeeded by 6th ward Alderman Eugene Sawyer, who was elected by the Chicago City Council and served until a special election. Richard M. Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, was elected in 1989. His accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development, as well as closing Meigs Field in the middle of the night and destroying the runways. After successfully running for re election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term.In 1992, a construction accident near the Kinzie Street Bridge produced a breach connecting the Chicago River to a tunnel below, which was part of an abandoned freight tunnel system extending throughout the downtown Loop district. The tunnels filled with 250 million US gallons of water, affecting buildings throughout the district and forcing a shutdown of electrical power. The area was shut down for three days and some buildings did not reopen for weeks; losses were estimated at 1.95 billion.On February 23, 2011, former Illinois Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel won the mayoral election. Emanuel was sworn in as mayor on May 16, 2011, and won re election in 2015. Lori Lightfoot, the city's first African American woman mayor and its first openly LGBTQ Mayor, was elected to succeed Emanuel as mayor in 2019. All three city wide elective offices were held by women for the first time in Chicago history: in addition to Lightfoot, the City Clerk was Anna Valencia and City Treasurer, Melissa Conyears Ervin.  Geography   Topography  Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of freshwater Lake Michigan. It is the principal city in the Chicago metropolitan area, situated in both the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region. The city rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds. In addition to it lying beside Lake Michigan, two rivers the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side flow either entirely or partially through the city.Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect: moderating Chicago's climate, making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer. When Chicago was founded in 1837, most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River, as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks. The overall grade of the city's central, built up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise. The average land elevation is 579 ft above sea level. While measurements vary somewhat, the lowest points are along the lake shore at 578 ft , while the highest point, at 672 ft , is the morainal ridge of Blue Island in the city's far south side.While the Chicago Loop is the central business district, Chicago is also a city of neighborhoods. Lake Shore Drive runs adjacent to a large portion of Chicago's waterfront. Some of the parks along the waterfront include Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park, and Jackson Park. There are 24 public beaches across 26 miles of the waterfront. Landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for Navy Pier, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus, and large portions of the McCormick Place Convention Center. Most of the city's high rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront. An informal name for the entire Chicago metropolitan area is Chicagoland , which generally means the city and all its suburbs. The Chicago Tribune, which coined the term, includes the city of Chicago, the rest of Cook County, and eight nearby Illinois counties: Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, Will and Kankakee, and three counties in Indiana: Lake, Porter and LaPorte. The Illinois Department of Tourism defines Chicagoland as Cook County without the city of Chicago, and only Lake, DuPage, Kane, and Will counties. The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce defines it as all of Cook and DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties.  Communities  Major sections of the city include the central business district, called The Loop, and the North, South, and West Sides. The three sides of the city are represented on the Flag of Chicago by three horizontal white stripes. The North Side is the most densely populated residential section of the city, and many high rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront. The South Side is the largest section of the city, encompassing roughly 60 of the city's land area. The South Side contains most of the facilities of the Port of Chicago.In the late 1920s, sociologists at the University of Chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas, which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods.  Streetscape  Chicago's streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the city's original townsite plot, which was bounded by Lake Michigan on the east, North Avenue on the north, Wood Street on the west, and 22nd Street on the south. Streets following the Public Land Survey System section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections. As new additions to the city were platted, city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction . The grid's regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property. A scattering of diagonal streets, many of them originally Native American trails, also cross the city . Many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the Plan of Chicago, but only the extension of Ogden Avenue was ever constructed.In 2016, Chicago was ranked the sixth most walkable large city in the United States. Many of the city's residential streets have a wide patch of grass or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself. This helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world. Other notable streets include Michigan Avenue, State Street, Oak, Rush, Clark Street, and Belmont Avenue. The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.  Architecture  The destruction caused by the Great Chicago Fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation. In 1885, the first steel framed high rise building, the Home Insurance Building, rose in the city as Chicago ushered in the skyscraper era, which would then be followed by many other cities around the world. Today, Chicago's skyline is among the world's tallest and densest.Some of the United States' tallest towers are located in Chicago; Willis Tower is the second tallest building in the Western Hemisphere after One World Trade Center, and Trump International Hotel and Tower is the third tallest in the country. The Loop's historic buildings include the Chicago Board of Trade Building, the Fine Arts Building, 35 East Wacker, and the Chicago Building, 860 880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments by Mies van der Rohe. Many other architects have left their impression on the Chicago skyline such as Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, Charles B. Atwood, John Root, and Helmut Jahn.The Merchandise Mart, once first on the list of largest buildings in the world, currently listed as 44th largest , had its own zip code until 2008, and stands near the junction of the North and South branches of the Chicago River. Presently, the four tallest buildings in the city are Willis Tower , Trump International Hotel and Tower, the Aon Center , and the John Hancock Center. Industrial districts, such as some areas on the South Side, the areas along the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Northwest Indiana area are clustered.Chicago gave its name to the Chicago School and was home to the Prairie School, two movements in architecture. Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found throughout Chicago. Large swaths of the city's residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick bungalows built from the early 20th century through the end of World War II. Chicago is also a prominent center of the Polish Cathedral style of church architecture. The Chicago suburb of Oak Park was home to famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who had designed The Robie House located near the University of Chicago.A popular tourist activity is to take an architecture boat tour along the Chicago River.  Monuments and public art  Chicago is famous for its outdoor public art with donors establishing funding for such art as far back as Benjamin Ferguson's 1905 trust. A number of Chicago's public art works are by modern figurative artists. Among these are Chagall's Four Seasons; the Chicago Picasso; Miro's Chicago; Calder's Flamingo; Oldenburg's Batcolumn; Moore's Large Interior Form, 1953 54, Man Enters the Cosmos and Nuclear Energy; Dubuffet's Monument with Standing Beast, Abakanowicz's Agora; and, Anish Kapoor's Cloud Gate which has become an icon of the city. Some events which shaped the city's history have also been memorialized by art works, including the Great Northern Migration and the centennial of statehood for Illinois. Finally, two fountains near the Loop also function as monumental works of art: Plensa's Crown Fountain as well as Burnham and Bennett's Buckingham Fountain.More representational and portrait statuary includes a number of works by Lorado Taft , French's Statue of the Republic, Edward Kemys's Lions, Saint Gaudens's Abraham Lincoln: The Man and Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State , Brioschi's Christopher Columbus, Me trovi 's The Bowman and The Spearman, Dallin's Signal of Peace, Fairbanks's The Chicago Lincoln, Boyle's The Alarm, Polasek's memorial to Masaryk, memorials along Solidarity Promenade to Ko ciuszko, Havli ek and Copernicus by Chodzinski, Strachovsk , and Thorvaldsen, a memorial to General Logan by Saint Gaudens, and Kearney's Moose . A number of statues also honor recent local heroes such as Michael Jordan , Stan Mikita, and Bobby Hull outside of the United Center; Harry Caray outside Wrigley field, Jack Brickhouse next to the WGN studios, and Irv Kupcinet at the Wabash Avenue Bridge.There are preliminary plans to erect a 1:1 scale replica of Wac aw Szymanowski's Art Nouveau statue of Fr d ric Chopin found in Warsaw's Royal Baths along Chicago's lakefront in addition to a different sculpture commemorating the artist in Chopin Park for the 200th anniversary of Fr d ric Chopin's birth.  Climate  The city lies within the typical hot summer humid continental climate , and experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are hot and humid, with frequent heat waves. The July daily average temperature is 75.9 F , with afternoon temperatures peaking at 85.0 F . In a normal summer, temperatures reach at least 90 F on as many as 23 days, with lakefront locations staying cooler when winds blow off the lake. Winters are relatively cold and snowy, although the city typically sees less snow and rain in winter than that experienced in the eastern Great Lakes region. Still, blizzards do occur, such as the one in 2011. There are many sunny but cold days in winter. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 F , with January and February being the coldest months; a polar vortex in January 2019 nearly broke the city's cold record of 27 F , which was set on January 20, 1985. Spring and autumn are mild, short seasons, typically with low humidity. Dew point temperatures in the summer range from an average of 55.7 F in June to 61.7 F in July, but can reach nearly 80 F , such as during the July 2019 heat wave. The city lies within USDA plant hardiness zone 6a, transitioning to 5b in the suburbs.According to the National Weather Service, Chicago's highest official temperature reading of 105 F was recorded on July 24, 1934, although Midway Airport reached 109 F one day prior and recorded a heat index of 125 F during the 1995 heatwave. The lowest official temperature of 27 F was recorded on January 20, 1985, at O'Hare Airport. Most of the city's rainfall is brought by thunderstorms, averaging 38 a year. The region is also prone to severe thunderstorms during the spring and summer which can produce large hail, damaging winds, and occasionally tornadoes. Like other major cities, Chicago experiences an urban heat island, making the city and its suburbs milder than surrounding rural areas, especially at night and in winter. The proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep the Chicago lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake. Northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake effect snow.  Time zone  As in the rest of the state of Illinois, Chicago forms part of the Central Time Zone. The border with the Eastern Time Zone is located a short distance to the east, used in Michigan and certain parts of Indiana.  Demographics  During its first hundred years, Chicago was one of the fastest growing cities in the world. When founded in 1833, fewer than 200 people had settled on what was then the American frontier. By the time of its first census, seven years later, the population had reached over 4,000. In the forty years from 1850 to 1890, the city's population grew from slightly under 30,000 to over 1 million. At the end of the 19th century, Chicago was the fifth largest city in the world, and the largest of the cities that did not exist at the dawn of the century. Within sixty years of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the population went from about 300,000 to over 3 million, and reached its highest ever recorded population of 3.6 million for the 1950 census. From the last two decades of the 19th century, Chicago was the destination of waves of immigrants from Ireland, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including Italians, Jews, Russians, Poles, Greeks, Lithuanians, Bulgarians, Albanians, Romanians, Turkish, Croatians, Serbs, Bosnians, Montenegrins and Czechs. To these ethnic groups, the basis of the city's industrial working class, were added an additional influx of African Americans from the American South with Chicago's black population doubling between 1910 and 1920 and doubling again between 1920 and 1930.In the 1920s and 1930s, the great majority of African Americans moving to Chicago settled in a so called Black Belt on the city's South Side. A large number of blacks also settled on the West Side. By 1930, two thirds of Chicago's black population lived in sections of the city which were 90 black in racial composition. Chicago's South Side emerged as United States second largest urban black concentration, following New York's Harlem. In 1990, Chicago's South Side and the adjoining south suburbs constituted the largest black majority region in the entire United States.Chicago's population declined in the latter half of the 20th century, from over 3.6 million in 1950 down to under 2.7 million by 2010. By the time of the official census count in 1990, it was overtaken by Los Angeles as the United States' second largest city.The city has seen a rise in population for the 2000 census and after a decrease in 2010, it rose again for the 2020 census.According to U.S. census estimates as of July 2019, Chicago's largest racial or ethnic group is non Hispanic White at 32.8 of the population, Blacks at 30.1 and the Hispanic population at 29.0 of the population. Chicago has the third largest LGBT population in the United States. In 2018, the Chicago Department of Health, estimated 7.5 of the adult population, approximately 146,000 Chicagoans, were LGBTQ. In 2015, roughly 4 of the population identified as LGBT. Since the 2013 legalization of same sex marriage in Illinois, over 10,000 same sex couples have wed in Cook County, a majority of them in Chicago.Chicago became a de jure sanctuary city in 2012 when Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the City Council passed the Welcoming City Ordinance.According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey data estimates for 2008 2012, the median income for a household in the city was 47,408, and the median income for a family was 54,188. Male full time workers had a median income of 47,074 versus 42,063 for females. About 18.3 of families and 22.1 of the population lived below the poverty line. In 2018, Chicago ranked seventh globally for the highest number of ultra high net worth residents with roughly 3,300 residents worth more than 30 million.According to the 2008 2012 American Community Survey, the ancestral groups having 10,000 or more persons in Chicago were: Persons identifying themselves in Other groups were classified at 1.72 million, and unclassified or not reported were approximately 153,000.  Religion  According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Chicago , with the city being the fourth most religious metropolis in the United States after Dallas, Atlanta and Houston. Roman Catholicism and Protestantism are the largest branches , followed by Eastern Orthodoxy and Jehovah's Witnesses with 1 each. Chicago also has a sizable non Christian population. Non Christian groups include Irreligious , Judaism , Islam , Buddhism and Hinduism .Chicago is the headquarters of several religious denominations, including the Evangelical Covenant Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It is the seat of several dioceses. The Fourth Presbyterian Church is one of the largest Presbyterian congregations in the United States based on memberships. Since the 20th century Chicago has also been the headquarters of the Assyrian Church of the East. In 2014 the Catholic Church was the largest individual Christian denomination , with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago being the largest Catholic jurisdiction. Evangelical Protestantism form the largest theological Protestant branch , followed by Mainline Protestants , and historically Black churches . Among denominational Protestant branches, Baptists formed the largest group in Chicago ; followed by Nondenominational ; Lutherans ; and Pentecostals .Non Christian faiths accounted for 7 of the religious population in 2014. Judaism has at least 261,000 adherents which is 3 of the population, making it the second largest religion. A 2020 study estimated the total Jewish population of the Chicago metropolitan area, both religious and irreligious, at 319,600.The first two Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893 and 1993 were held in Chicago. Many international religious leaders have visited Chicago, including Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II in 1979.  Economy  Chicago has the third largest gross metropolitan product in the United States about 670.5 billion according to September 2017 estimates. The city has also been rated as having the most balanced economy in the United States, due to its high level of diversification. In 2007, Chicago was named the fourth most important business center in the world in the MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area recorded the greatest number of new or expanded corporate facilities in the United States for calendar year 2014. The Chicago metropolitan area has the third largest science and engineering work force of any metropolitan area in the nation. In 2009 Chicago placed ninth on the UBS list of the world's richest cities. Chicago was the base of commercial operations for industrialists John Crerar, John Whitfield Bunn, Richard Teller Crane, Marshall Field, John Farwell, Julius Rosenwald and many other commercial visionaries who laid the foundation for Midwestern and global industry. Chicago is a major world financial center, with the second largest central business district in the United States. The city is the seat of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Bank's Seventh District.

Illinois is home to 66 Fortune 1000 companies, including those in Chicago. The city of Chicago also hosts 12 Fortune Global 500 companies and 17 Financial Times 500 companies. The city claims three Dow 30 companies: aerospace giant Boeing, which moved its headquarters from Seattle to the Chicago Loop in 2001, McDonald's and Walgreens Boots Alliance. For six consecutive years since 2013, Chicago was ranked the nation's top metropolitan area for corporate relocations.Manufacturing, printing, publishing and food processing also play major roles in the city's economy. Several medical products and services companies are headquartered in the Chicago area, including Baxter International, Boeing, Abbott Laboratories, and the Healthcare division of General Electric. In addition to Boeing, which located its headquarters in Chicago in 2001, and United Airlines in 2011, GE Transportation moved its offices to the city in 2013 and GE Healthcare moved its HQ to the city in 2016, as did ThyssenKrupp North America, and agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland. Moreover, the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which helped move goods from the Great Lakes south on the Mississippi River, and of the railroads in the 19th century made the city a major transportation center in the United States. In the 1840s, Chicago became a major grain port, and in the 1850s and 1860s Chicago's pork and beef industry expanded. As the major meat companies grew in Chicago many, such as Armour and Company, created global enterprises. Although the meatpacking industry currently plays a lesser role in the city's economy, Chicago continues to be a major transportation and distribution center.

In 2003, Robb Report named Chicago the country's most exceptional dining destination .  Literature  Chicago literature finds its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of social realism. In the Encyclopedia of Chicago, Northwestern University Professor Bill Savage describes Chicago fiction as prose which tries to capture the essence of the city, its spaces and its people . The challenge for early writers was that Chicago was a frontier outpost that transformed into a global metropolis in the span of two generations. Narrative fiction of that time, much of it in the style of high flown romance and genteel realism , needed a new approach to describe the urban social, political, and economic conditions of Chicago. Nonetheless, Chicagoans worked hard to create a literary tradition that would stand the test of time, and create a city of feeling out of concrete, steel, vast lake, and open prairie. Much notable Chicago fiction focuses on the city itself, with social criticism keeping exultation in check. At least three short periods in the history of Chicago have had a lasting influence on American literature. These include from the time of the Great Chicago Fire to about 1900, what became known as the Chicago Literary Renaissance in the 1910s and early 1920s, and the period of the Great Depression through the 1940s. What would become the influential Poetry magazine was founded in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, who was working as an art critic for the Chicago Tribune. The magazine discovered such poets as Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and John Ashbery. T. S. Eliot's first professionally published poem, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock , was first published by Poetry. Contributors have included Ezra Pound, William Butler Yeats, William Carlos Williams, Langston Hughes, and Carl Sandburg, among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the Imagist and Objectivist poetic movements. From the 1950s through 1970s, American poetry continued to evolve in Chicago. In the 1980s, a modern form of poetry performance began in Chicago, the poetry slam.  Sports  Sporting News named Chicago the Best Sports City in the United States in 1993, 2006, and 2010. Along with Boston, Chicago is the only city to continuously host major professional sports since 1871, having only taken 1872 and 1873 off due to the Great Chicago Fire. Additionally, Chicago is one of the eight cities in the United States to have won championships in the four major professional leagues and, along with Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, is one of five cities to have won soccer championships as well. All of its major franchises have won championships within recent years the Bears , the Bulls , the White Sox , the Cubs , the Blackhawks , and the Fire . Chicago has the third most franchises in the four major North American sports leagues with five, behind the New York and Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas, and have six top level professional sports clubs when including Chicago Fire FC of Major League Soccer .

They have played more games and have more wins than any other team in Major League baseball since 1876. They have won three World Series titles, including the 2016 World Series, but had the dubious honor of having the two longest droughts in American professional sports: They had not won their sport's title since 1908, and had not participated in a World Series since 1945, both records, until they beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series.The White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with all three of their home fields throughout the years being within blocks of one another. They have won three World Series titles and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox are fifth in the American League in all time wins, and sixth in pennants.The Chicago Bears, one of the last two remaining charter members of the National Football League , have won nine NFL Championships, including the 1985 Super Bowl XX. The other remaining charter franchise, the Chicago Cardinals, also started out in the city, but is now known as the Arizona Cardinals.

Parks and greenspace  When Chicago was incorporated in 1837, it chose the motto Urbs in Horto, a Latin phrase which means City in a Garden . Today, the Chicago Park District consists of more than 570 parks with over 8,000 acres of municipal parkland. There are 31 sand beaches, a plethora of museums, two world class conservatories, and 50 nature areas. Lincoln Park, the largest of the city's parks, covers 1,200 acres and has over 20 million visitors each year, making it third in the number of visitors after Central Park in New York City, and the National Mall and Memorial Parks in Washington, D.C.There is a historic boulevard system, a network of wide, tree lined boulevards which connect a number of Chicago parks. The boulevards and the parks were authorized by the Illinois legislature in 1869. A number of Chicago neighborhoods emerged along these roadways in the 19th century. The building of the boulevard system continued intermittently until 1942. It includes nineteen boulevards, eight parks, and six squares, along twenty six miles of interconnected streets. The Chicago Park Boulevard System Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.With berths for more than 6,000 boats, the Chicago Park District operates the nation's largest municipal harbor system.

Washington Park is also one of the city's biggest parks; covering nearly 400 acres . The park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in South Side Chicago.  Law and government   Government  The government of the City of Chicago is divided into executive and legislative branches. The mayor of Chicago is the chief executive, elected by general election for a term of four years, with no term limits. The current mayor is Lori Lightfoot. The mayor appoints commissioners and other officials who oversee the various departments. As well as the mayor, Chicago's clerk and treasurer are also elected citywide. The City Council is the legislative branch and is made up of 50 aldermen, one elected from each ward in the city. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions and approves the city budget.The Chicago Police Department provides law enforcement and the Chicago Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the city and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois, in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois state's attorney; in the Federal court it is the United States attorney.  Politics  During much of the last half of the 19th century, Chicago's politics were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations. For much of the 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been solid blue in presidential elections since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where the Republicans have come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding.Chicago contains less than 25 of the state's population, but it is split between eight of Illinois' 19 districts in the United States House of Representatives. All eight of the city's representatives are Democrats; only two Republicans have represented a significant portion of the city since 1973, for one term each: Robert P. Hanrahan from 1973 to 1975, and Michael Patrick Flanagan from 1995 to 1997.Machine politics persisted in Chicago after the decline of similar machines in other large U.S. cities. During much of that time, the city administration found opposition mainly from a liberal independent faction of the Democratic Party. The independents finally gained control of city government in 1983 with the election of Harold Washington . From 1989 until May 16, 2011, Chicago was under the leadership of its longest serving mayor, Richard M. Daley, the son of Richard J. Daley. Because of the dominance of the Democratic Party in Chicago, the Democratic primary vote held in the spring is generally more significant than the general elections in November for U.S. House and Illinois State seats. The aldermanic, mayoral, and other city offices are filled through nonpartisan elections with runoffs as needed.The city is home of former United States President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama; Barack Obama was formerly a state legislator representing Chicago and later a US senator. The Obamas' residence is located near the University of Chicago in Kenwood on the city's south side.  Crime  Chicago's crime rate in 2020 was 3,926 per 100,000 people. Chicago had a murder rate of 18.5 per 100,000 residents in 2012, ranking 16th among US cities with 100,000 people or more. This was higher than in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest cities in the United States, which have lower murder rates and lower total homicides. However, it was less than in many smaller American cities, including New Orleans, Newark, and Detroit, although the latter has fallen substantially in recent years. The 2015 year end crime statistics showed there were 468 murders in Chicago in 2015 compared with 416 the year before, a 12.5 increase, as well as 2,900 shootings 13 more than the year prior, and up 29 since 2013. Chicago had more homicides than any other city in 2015 in total but not on per capita basis, according to the Chicago Tribune. In its annual crime statistics for 2016, the Chicago Police Department reported that the city experienced a dramatic rise in gun violence, with 4,331 shooting victims. The department also reported 762 murders in Chicago for the year 2016, a total that marked a 62.79 increase in homicides from 2015. In June 2017, the Chicago Police Department and the Federal ATF announced a new task force, similar to past task forces, to address the flow of illegal guns and repeat offenses with guns.According to reports in 2013, most of Chicago's violent crime comes from gangs trying to maintain control of drug selling territories , and is specifically related to the activities of the Sinaloa Cartel, which is active in several American cities. By 2006, the cartel sought to control most illicit drug sales. Violent crime rates vary significantly by area of the city, with more economically developed areas having low rates, but other sections have much higher rates of crime. In 2013, the violent crime rate was 910 per 100,000 people; the murder rate was 10.4 while high crime districts saw 38.9, low crime districts saw 2.5 murders per 100,000.The number of murders in Chicago peaked at 970 in 1974, when the city's population was over 3 million people , and it reached 943 murders in 1992, . However, Chicago, like other major U.S. cities, experienced a significant reduction in violent crime rates through the 1990s, falling to 448 homicides in 2004, its lowest total since 1965 and only 15.65 murders per 100,000. Chicago's homicide tally remained low during 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 but rose to 510 in 2008, breaking 500 for the first time since 2003. In 2009, the murder count fell to 458 . and in 2010 Chicago's murder rate fell to 435 , a 5 decrease from 2009 and lowest levels since 1965. In 2011, Chicago's murders fell another 1.2 to 431 . but shot up to 506 in 2012.In 2012, Chicago ranked 21st in the United States in numbers of homicides per person, and in the first half of 2013 there was a significant drop per person, in all categories of violent crime, including homicide . Chicago ended 2013 with 415 murders, the lowest number of murders since 1965, and overall crime rates dropped by 16 percent. In 2013, the city's murder rate was only slightly higher than the national average as a whole. According to the FBI, St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, and Baltimore had the highest murder rate along with several other cities. Jens Ludwig, director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, estimated that shootings cost the city of Chicago 2.5 billion in 2012.As of 2021, Chicago has become the American city with the highest number of carjackings. Chicago began experiencing a massive surge in carjackings after 2019, and at least 1,415 such crimes took place in the city in 2020. According to the Chicago Police Department, carjackers are using face masks that are widely worn due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic to effectively blend in with the public and conceal their identity. On January 27, 2021, Mayor Lightfoot described the worsening wave of carjackings as being 'top of mind,' and added 40 police officers to the CPD carjacking unit.  Employee pensions  In September 2016, an Illinois state appellate court found that cities do not have an obligation under the Illinois Constitution to pay certain benefits if those benefits had included an expiration date under whichever negotiated agreement they were covered. The Illinois Constitution prohibits governments from doing anything that could cause retirement benefits for government workers to be diminished or impaired. In this particular case, the fact that the workers' agreements had expiration dates let the city of Chicago set an expiration date of 2013 for contribution to health benefits for workers who retired after 1989.  Education   Schools and libraries  Chicago Public Schools is the governing body of the school district that contains over 600 public elementary and high schools citywide, including several selective admission magnet schools.

Lane is one of the oldest schools in Chicago and in 2012 was designated a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.Chicago high school rankings are determined by the average test scores on state achievement tests. The district, with an enrollment exceeding 400,545 students , is the third largest in the U.S. On September 10, 2012, teachers for the Chicago Teachers Union went on strike for the first time since 1987 over pay, resources and other issues. According to data compiled in 2014, Chicago's choice system , where students who test or apply and may attend one of a number of public high schools , sorts students of different achievement levels into different schools .Chicago has a network of Lutheran schools, and several private schools are run by other denominations and faiths, such as the Ida Crown Jewish Academy in West Ridge.

Music  In 2005, indie rock artist Sufjan Stevens created a concept album about Illinois titled Illinois; many of its songs were about Chicago and its history.  Industrial genre  The city was particularly important for the development of the harsh and electronic based music genre known as industrial. Many themes are transgressive and derived from the works of authors such as William S. Burroughs. While the genre was pioneered by Throbbing Gristle in the late 70s, the genre was largely started in the United Kingdom, with the Chicago based record label Wax Trax! later establishing itself as America's home for the genre. The label first found success with Ministry, with the release of the cold life single, which entered the US Dance charts in 1982. The record label later signed many prominent industrial acts, with the most notable being: My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, KMFDM, Front Line Assembly and Front 242. Richard Giraldi of the Chicago Sun Times remarked on the significance of the label and wrote, As important as Chess Records was to blues and soul music, Chicago's Wax Trax imprint was just as significant to the punk rock, new wave and industrial genres.  Video games  Chicago is also featured in a few video games, including Watch Dogs and Midtown Madness, a real life, car driving simulation game. Chicago is home to NetherRealm Studios, the developers of the Mortal Kombat series. Storymind Entertainment, which is an independent Ukrainian studio, created a neo noir third person shooter video game called My Eyes On You, which is inspired by Chicago's love for noir films and its history relating to infamous Italian mafia groups.  Infrastructure   Transportation  Chicago is a major transportation hub in the United States. It is an important component in global distribution, as it is the third largest inter modal port in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore.The city of Chicago has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 26.5 percent of Chicago households were without a car, and increased slightly to 27.5 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Chicago averaged 1.12 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.  Expressways  Seven mainline and four auxiliary interstate highways , 80 , 88, 90 , 94 , 190, 290, 294, and 355 run through Chicago and its suburbs. Segments that link to the city center are named after influential politicians, with three of them named after former U.S. Presidents and one named after two time Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson. The Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways are the busiest state maintained routes in the entire state of Illinois.  Transit systems  The Regional Transportation Authority coordinates the operation of the three service boards: CTA, Metra, and Pace. The Chicago Transit Authority handles public transportation in the City of Chicago and a few adjacent suburbs outside of the Chicago city limits. The CTA operates an extensive network of buses and a rapid transit elevated and subway system known as the 'L' , with lines designated by colors. These rapid transit lines also serve both Midway and O'Hare Airports. The CTA's rail lines consist of the Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Brown, Purple, Pink, and Yellow lines. Both the Red and Blue lines offer 24 hour service which makes Chicago one of a handful of cities around the world to offer rail service 24 hours a day, every day of the year, within the city's limits. Metra, the nation's second most used passenger regional rail network, operates an 11 line commuter rail service in Chicago and throughout the Chicago suburbs. The Metra Electric Line shares its trackage with Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District's South Shore Line, which provides commuter service between South Bend and Chicago. Pace provides bus and paratransit service in over 200 surrounding suburbs with some extensions into the city as well. A 2005 study found that one quarter of commuters used public transit.Greyhound Lines provides inter city bus service to and from the city, and Chicago is also the hub for the Midwest network of Megabus .  Passenger rail  Amtrak long distance and commuter rail services originate from Union Station. Chicago is one of the largest hubs of passenger rail service in the nation. The services terminate in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., New York City, Indianapolis, New Orleans, Portland, Seattle, Milwaukee, Quincy, St. Louis, Carbondale, Boston, Grand Rapids, Port Huron, Pontiac, Los Angeles, and San Antonio. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to link Chicago with New York City via the Chicago New York Electric Air Line Railroad. Parts of this were built, but it was never completed.  Bicycle and scooter sharing systems  In July 2013, the bicycle sharing system Divvy was launched with 750 bikes and 75 docking stations It is operated by Lyft for the Chicago Department of Transportation. As of July 2019, Divvy operated 5800 bicycles at 608 stations, covering almost all of the city, excluding Pullman, Rosedale, Beverly, Belmont Cragin and Edison Park.In May 2019, The City of Chicago announced its Chicago's Electric Shared Scooter Pilot Program, scheduled to run from June 15 to October 15. The program started on June 15 with 10 different scooter companies, including scooter sharing market leaders Bird, Jump, Lime and Lyft. Each company was allowed to bring 250 electric scooters, although both Bird and Lime claimed that they experienced a higher demand for their scooters. The program ended on October 15, with nearly 800,000 rides taken.  Freight rail  Chicago is the largest hub in the railroad industry. Six of the seven Class I railroads meet in Chicago, with the exception being the Kansas City Southern Railway. As of 2002, severe freight train congestion caused trains to take as long to get through the Chicago region as it took to get there from the West Coast of the country . According to U.S. Department of Transportation, the volume of imported and exported goods transported via rail to, from, or through Chicago is forecast to increase nearly 150 percent between 2010 and 2040. CREATE, the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program, comprises about 70 programs, including crossovers, overpasses and underpasses, that intend to significantly improve the speed of freight movements in the Chicago area.  Airports  Chicago is served by O'Hare International Airport, the world's busiest airport measured by airline operations, on the far Northwest Side, and Midway International Airport on the Southwest Side. In 2005, O'Hare was the world's busiest airport by aircraft movements and the second busiest by total passenger traffic. Both O'Hare and Midway are owned and operated by the City of Chicago. Gary Chicago International Airport and Chicago Rockford International Airport, located in Gary, Indiana and Rockford, Illinois, respectively, can serve as alternative Chicago area airports, however they do not offer as many commercial flights as O'Hare and Midway. In recent years the state of Illinois has been leaning towards building an entirely new airport in the Illinois suburbs of Chicago. The City of Chicago is the world headquarters for United Airlines, the world's third largest airline.  Port authority  The Port of Chicago consists of several major port facilities within the city of Chicago operated by the Illinois International Port District . The central element of the Port District, Calumet Harbor, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Iroquois Landing Lakefront Terminal: at the mouth of the Calumet River, it includes 100 acres of warehouses and facilities on Lake Michigan with over 780,000 square meters of storage. Lake Calumet terminal: located at the union of the Grand Calumet River and Little Calumet River 6 miles inland from Lake Michigan. Includes three transit sheds totaling over 29,000 square meters adjacent to over 900 linear meters of ship and barge berthing. Grain and bulk liquid storage facilities along Lake Calumet. The Illinois International Port district also operates Foreign trade zone No. 22, which extends 60 miles from Chicago's city limits.  Utilities  Electricity for most of northern Illinois is provided by Commonwealth Edison, also known as ComEd. Their service territory borders Iroquois County to the south, the Wisconsin border to the north, the Iowa border to the west and the Indiana border to the east. In northern Illinois, ComEd operates the greatest number of nuclear generating plants in any US state. Because of this, ComEd reports indicate that Chicago receives about 75 of its electricity from nuclear power. Recently, the city began installing wind turbines on government buildings to promote renewable energy.Natural gas is provided by Peoples Gas, a subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group, which is headquartered in Chicago. Domestic and industrial waste was once incinerated but it is now landfilled, mainly in the Calumet area. From 1995 to 2008, the city had a blue bag program to divert recyclable refuse from landfills. Because of low participation in the blue bag programs, the city began a pilot program for blue bin recycling like other cities. This proved successful and blue bins were rolled out across the city.  Health systems  The Illinois Medical District is on the Near West Side. It includes Rush University Medical Center, ranked as the second best hospital in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News World Report for 2014 16, the University of Illinois Medical Center at Chicago, Jesse Brown VA Hospital, and John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, one of the busiest trauma centers in the nation.Two of the country's premier academic medical centers reside in Chicago, including Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the University of Chicago Medical Center. The Chicago campus of Northwestern University includes the Feinberg School of Medicine; Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which is ranked as the best hospital in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News World Report for 2017 18; the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab , which is ranked the best U.S. rehabilitation hospital by U.S. News World Report; the new Prentice Women's Hospital; and Ann Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

Sister cities  Chicago has 28 sister cities around the world. Like Chicago, many of them are the main city of a country that has had large numbers of immigrants settle in Chicago. These relationships have sought to promote economic, cultural, educational, and other ties.To celebrate the sister cities, Chicago hosts a yearly festival in Daley Plaza, which features cultural acts and food tastings from the other cities. In addition, the Chicago Sister Cities program hosts a number of delegation and formal exchanges. In some cases, these exchanges have led to further informal collaborations, such as the academic relationship between the Buehler Center on Aging, Health Society at the Feinberg School of Medicine of Northwestern University and the Institute of Gerontology of Ukraine , that was originally established as part of the Chicago Kyiv sister cities program.Sister cities  See also Chicago area water quality Chicago Wilderness Gentrification of Chicago List of cities with the most skyscrapers List of people from Chicago List of fiction set in Chicago National Register of Historic Places listings in Central Chicago National Register of Historic Places listings in North Side Chicago National Register of Historic Places listings in West Side Chicago  Explanatory notes   Citations   General and cited references   External links  Official website Choose Chicago Official tourism website Chicago History Maps of Chicago from the American Geographical Society Library Historic American Landscapes Survey No. IL 10, Chicago Cityscape, Chicago, Cook County, IL , 45 photos, 4 photo caption pages Chicago LocalWiki Local Chicago Wiki Chicago .

            "text": "Claude Chappe was a French inventor who in 1792 demonstrated a practical semaphore system that eventually spanned all of France. His system consisted of a series of towers, each within line of sight of others, each supporting a wooden mast with two crossarms on pivots that could be placed in various positions. The operator in a tower moved the arms to a sequence of positions, spelling out text messages in semaphore code. The operator in the next tower read the message through a telescope, then passed it on to the next tower. This was the first practical telecommunications system of the industrial age, and was used until the 1850s when electric telegraph systems replaced it.  Life  Claude Chappe was born in Br lon, Sarthe, France, the son of Ignace Chappe, a contr leur of the Crown lands for Laval, and his wife Marie Devernay, daughter of a physician of Laval. He was raised for church service, but lost his sinecure during the French Revolution. He was educated at the Lyc e Pierre Corneille in Rouen.His uncle was the astronomer Jean Baptiste Chappe d'Auteroche, famed for his observations of the Transit of Venus in 1761 and again in 1769. The first book Claude read in his youth was his uncle's journal of the 1761 trip, Voyage en Siberie . His brother, Abraham, wrote Reading this book greatly inspired him, and gave him a taste for the physical sciences. From this point on, all his studies, and even his pastimes, were focused on that subject. Because of his astronomer uncle, Claude may also have become familiar with the properties of telescopes.He and his four unemployed brothers decided to develop a practical system of semaphore relay stations, a task proposed in antiquity, yet never realized. Claude's brother, Ignace Chappe was a member of the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution. With his help, the Assembly supported a proposal to build a relay line from Paris to Lille , to carry dispatches from the war. The Chappe brothers determined by experiment that the angles of a rod were easier to see than the presence or absence of panels. Their final design had two arms connected by a cross arm. Each arm had seven positions, and the cross arm had four more, permitting a 196 combination code. The arms were from three to thirty feet long, black, and counterweighted, moved by only two handles. Lamps mounted on the arms proved unsatisfactory for night use. The relay towers were placed from 12 to 25 km apart. Each tower had a telescope pointing both up and down the relay line. Chappe first called his invention the tachygraph, meaning fast writer . However, the Army preferred to use the word telegraph, meaning far writer , which was coined by French statesman Andr Fran ois Miot de M lito. Today, in order to distinguish it from subsequent telegraph systems, the French name for Chappe's semaphore telegraph system is named after him, and thus is known as a t l graphe Chappe. Alternatively, Chappe coined the phrase semaphore, from the Greek elements  ; and from  , or  from   .In 1792, the first messages were successfully sent between Paris and Lille. In 1794 the semaphore line informed Parisians of the capture of Cond sur l'Escaut from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred. Other lines were built, including a line from Paris to Toulon. The system was widely copied by other European states, and was used by Napoleon to coordinate his empire and army.In 1805, Claude Chappe killed himself. He was said to be depressed by illness, and claims by rivals that he had plagiarized from military semaphore systems. In 1824 Ignace Chappe attempted to increase interest in using the semaphore line for commercial messages, such as commodity prices; however, the business community resisted. In 1846, the government of France committed to a new system of electric telegraph lines. Many contemporaries warned of the ease of sabotage and interruption of service by cutting a wire. With the emergence of the electric telegraph, slowly the Chappe telegraph ended in 1852.  Popular culture The Chappe semaphore figures prominently in Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. The Count bribes an underpaid operator to transmit a false message. A bronze sculpture of Claude Chappe was erected at the crossing of Rue du Bac and Boulevard Raspail, in Paris. As many statues displeased or offended Hitler, it was removed and melted down during the Nazi occupation of Paris, in 1941 or 1942.

            "text": "Claude Elwood Shannon was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as a father of information theory .As a 21 year old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , he wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship. Shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense of the United States during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications.  Biography   Childhood  The Shannon family lived in Gaylord, Michigan, and Claude was born in a hospital in nearby Petoskey. His father, Claude Sr. , was a businessman and for a while, a judge of probate in Gaylord. His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon , was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of Gaylord High School. Claude Sr. was a descendant of New Jersey settlers, while Mabel was a child of German immigrants.Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio controlled model boat and a barbed wire telegraph system to a friend's house a half mile away. While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the Western Union company. Shannon's childhood hero was Thomas Edison, who he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden , a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.  Logic circuits  In 1932, Shannon entered the University of Michigan, where he was introduced to the work of George Boole. He graduated in 1936 with two bachelor's degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics. In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer, an early analog computer. While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. A paper from this thesis was published in 1938. In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used during that time in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4 bit full adder.Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously. Howard Gardner called Shannon's thesis possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century. Shannon received his PhD from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in order to develop a mathematical formulation for Mendelian genetics. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.In 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Einstein and Kurt G del. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.  Wartime research  Shannon then joined Bell Labs to work on fire control systems and cryptography during World War II, under a contract with section D 2 of the National Defense Research Committee . Shannon is credited with the invention of signal flow graphs, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the U.S. Navy's cryptanalytic service the methods used by the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to break the ciphers used by the Kriegsmarine U boats in the north Atlantic Ocean. He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria. Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the Universal Turing machine . This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own. In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire Control Systems, coauthored by Shannon, Ralph Beebe Blackman, and Hendrik Wade Bode, formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire control by analogy with the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems. In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the Information Age. Shannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on communication theory. At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography , dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems in the Bell System Technical Journal. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that they were so close together you couldn t separate them . In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to develop these results in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information. While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the cryptographic one time pad is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published 1949. The same article also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.  Information theory  In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as A Mathematical Theory of Communication , an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory. The book The Mathematical Theory of Communication reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Warren Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non specialist. Weaver pointed out that the word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise. Information theory's fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in 1951, in his article Prediction and Entropy of Printed English , showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating whitespace as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition. Another notable paper published in 1949 is Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems , a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous time signal from a discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later. He returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.  Teaching at MIT  In 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the Research Laboratory of Electronics . He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.  Later life  Shannon developed Alzheimer's disease and spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home; he died in 2001, survived by his wife, a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.  Hobbies and inventions  Outside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in juggling, unicycling, and chess. He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, juggling machines. He built a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle.Shannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.He is also considered the co inventor of the first wearable computer along with Edward O. Thorp. The device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette.  Personal life  Shannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married Ben Barzman.Shannon met his second wife, Betty Shannon , when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949. Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions. They had three children.Shannon presented himself as apolitical and an atheist.  Tributes  There are six statues of Shannon sculpted by Eugene Daub: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the University of California, San Diego; one at Bell Labs; and another at AT T Shannon Labs. The statue in Gaylord is located in the Claude Shannon Memorial Park. After the breakup of the Bell System, the part of Bell Labs that remained with AT T Corporation was named Shannon Labs in his honor. According to Neil Sloane, an AT T Fellow who co edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948: He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him. The cryptocurrency unit shannon is named after him.A Mind at Play, a biography of Shannon written by Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, was published in 2017.On April 30, 2016, Shannon was honored with a Google Doodle to celebrate his life on what would have been his 100th birthday.The Bit Player, a feature film about Shannon directed by Mark Levinson premiered at the World Science Festival in 2019. Drawn from interviews conducted with Shannon in his house in the 1980s, the film was released on Amazon Prime in August 2020.  The Mathematical Theory of Communication   Weaver's Contribution  Shannon's The Mathematical Theory of Communication, begins with an interpretation of his own work by Warren Weaver. Although Shannon's entire work is about communication itself, Warren Weaver communicated his ideas in such a way that those not acclimated to complex theory and mathematics could comprehend the fundamental laws he put forth. The coupling of their unique communicational abilities and ideas generated the Shannon Weaver model, although the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings emanate entirely from Shannon's work after Weaver's introduction. For layman Weaver's introduction better communicates The Mathematical Theory of Communication, but Shannon's subsequent logic, mathematics, and expressive precision was responsible for defining the problem itself.  Other work   Shannon's mouse  Theseus , created in 1950, was a mechanical mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a labyrinth of 25 squares. The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions. The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior. Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.  Shannon's estimate for the complexity of chess  In 1949 Shannon completed a paper which estimates the game tree complexity of chess, which is approximately 10120. This number is now often referred to as the Shannon number , and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to solving the game of chess using an exhaustive analysis .  Shannon's computer chess program  On March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called Programming a Computer for playing Chess . The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in Philosophical Magazine, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to solve the game.His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure, based on an evaluation function of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. Material was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value . He considered some positional factors, subtracting point for each doubled pawn, backward pawn, and isolated pawn; mobility was incorporated by adding 0.1 point for each legal move available.  Shannon's maxim  Shannon formulated a version of Kerckhoffs' principle as The enemy knows the system . In this form it is known as Shannon's maxim .  Commemorations   Shannon centenary  The Shannon centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916. It was inspired in part by the Alan Turing Year. An ad hoc committee of the IEEE Information Theory Society including Christina Fragouli, R diger Urbanke, Michelle Effros, Lav Varshney and Sergio Verd , coordinated worldwide events. The initiative was announced in the History Panel at the 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop Jerusalem and the IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter.A detailed listing of confirmed events was available on the website of the IEEE Information Theory Society.Some of the planned activities included: Bell Labs hosted the First Shannon Conference on the Future of the Information Age on April 28 29, 2016, in Murray Hill, New Jersey, to celebrate Claude Shannon and the continued impact of his legacy on society. The event includes keynote speeches by global luminaries and visionaries of the information age who will explore the impact of information theory on society and our digital future, informal recollections, and leading technical presentations on subsequent related work in other areas such as bioinformatics, economic systems, and social networks. There is also a student competition Bell Labs launched a Web exhibit on April 30, 2016, chronicling Shannon's hiring at Bell Labs , his subsequent work there from 1942 through 1957, and details of Mathematics Department. The exhibit also displayed bios of colleagues and managers during his tenure, as well as original versions of some of the technical memoranda which subsequently became well known in published form. The Republic of Macedonia is planning a commemorative stamp. A USPS commemorative stamp is being proposed, with an active petition. A documentary on Claude Shannon and on the impact of information theory, The Bit Player, is being produced by Sergio Verd and Mark Levinson. A trans Atlantic celebration of both George Boole's bicentenary and Claude Shannon's centenary that is being led by University College Cork and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A first event was a workshop in Cork, When Boole Meets Shannon, and will continue with exhibits at the Boston Museum of Science and at the MIT Museum. Many organizations around the world are holding observance events, including the Boston Museum of Science, the Heinz Nixdorf Museum, the Institute for Advanced Study, Technische Universit t Berlin, University of South Australia , Unicamp , University of Toronto, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cairo University, Telecom ParisTech, National Technical University of Athens, Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, University of Maryland, University of Illinois at Chicago, cole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, The Pennsylvania State University , University of California Los Angeles, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

It is the largest city in El Paso County, with a population of 478,961 at the 2020 United States Census, a 15.02 increase since 2010. Colorado Springs is the second most populous city and the most extensive city in the state of Colorado, and the 40th most populous city in the United States. It is the principal city of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the second most prominent city of the Front Range Urban Corridor. It is located in east central Colorado, on Fountain Creek, 70 miles south of Denver. At 6,035 feet the city stands over 1 mile above sea level, though some areas are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is near the base of Pikes Peak, which rises 14,115 feet above sea level on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains.  History  The Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first recorded inhabiting the area which would become Colorado Springs. Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was formally organized on August 13, 1859 during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867. So many immigrants from England had settled in Colorado Springs by the early 1870s that Colorado Springs was locally referred to as Little London. In 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City. Within a year, Fountain Colony was renamed Colorado Springs and officially incorporated. The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. On December 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations. The second period of annexations was during 1889 90, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition. In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers. By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north south Cascade Avenue and the east west Washington Pikes Peak avenues.: 10 From 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill, and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919. Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.The city's military presence began during World War II, beginning with Camp Carson that was established in 1941. During the war, the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it Peterson Field in December 1942.In November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command . The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base. North American Aerospace Defense Command was established as a hardened command and control center within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex during the Cold War.Between 1965 and 1968, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak State College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city. In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.On October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition, Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation . Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008.  Geography  The city lies in a semi arid Steppe climate region with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo. Colorado Springs is 69 miles or one hour and five minutes south of Denver by car using I 25.Colorado Springs has the greatest total area of any municipality in Colorado. At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of 125,287 acres including 232 acres of water.  Metropolitan area  Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area such as parks, bike trails, and open spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities experiencing tremendous growth such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budgetary issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced since 1997, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.  Climate  Colorado Springs has a cooler, dry winter semi arid climate , and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day to day variability in weather conditions. The city has abundant sunshine year round, averaging 243 sunny days per year, and receives approximately 16.5 inches of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005 but permanently reinstated in December 2019.Colorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.  Seasonal climate  Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging 30.8 F ; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima. Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub 0 F lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing.Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving 38 inches per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24 hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging 70.9 F , and 18 days of 90 F highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above 70 F . Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American monsoon.The first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from 101 F on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to 27 F on February 1, 1951, and December 9, 1919.

Preface Tesla's notes at the Colorado Springs experimental station were unpublished until the release of this book. Arrangements through the Nikola Tesla Museum allowed Aleksandar Marin i to make commentaries on the notes. The Nikola Tesla Museum published the work to mark the 120th anniversary of Tesla's birth.  Introduction Tesla was focused in his research for the practical development of a system for wireless transmission of power and a utilization system. Tesla said, in On electricity , Electrical Review : In fact, progress in this field has given me fresh hope that I shall see the fulfillment of one of my fondest dreams; namely, the transmission of power from station to station without the employment of any connecting wires. Tesla went to Colorado Springs in mid May 1899 with the intent to research: Transmitters of great power. Individualization and isolating the energy transmission means. Laws of propagation of currents through the earth and the atmosphere.Tesla spent more than half his time researching transmitters. Tesla spent less than a quarter of his time researching delicate receivers and about a tenth of his time measuring the capacity of the vertical antenna. Also, Tesla spent a tenth of his time researching miscellaneous subjects. The authors notes J. R. Wait's comment on Tesla activity, From an historical standpoint, it is significant that the genius Nikola Tesla envisaged a world wide communication system using a huge spark gap transmitter located in Colorado Springs in 1899. A few years later he built a large facility in Long Island that he hoped would transmit signals to the Cornish coast of England. In addition, he proposed to use a modified version of the system to distribute power to all points of the globe .The authors note that no alterations have been made to the original which still contains certain minor errors; calculation errors which influence conclusions are noted. The authors also note the end of the book contains commentaries on the Diary with explanatory notes.  June 1 to January 7 The main content of the book is composed of notes written by Tesla between June 1, 1899 to January 7, 1900.

Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications. As of 1 January 2021, there are 2,224 communications satellites in Earth orbit. Most communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite. The high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the Earth. The purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the Earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points. Communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies. To avoid signal interference, international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or bands certain organizations are allowed to use. This allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.  History   Origins  In October 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published an article titled Extraterrestrial Relays in the British magazine Wireless World. The article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals. Because of this, Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the concept of the communications satellite, and the term 'Clarke Belt' is employed as a description of the orbit. The first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1 which was put into orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. It was developed by Mikhail Tikhonravov and Sergey Korolev, building on work by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Sputnik 1 was equipped with an on board radio transmitter that worked on two frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, or 7 and 15 meters wavelength. The satellite was not placed in orbit for the purpose of sending data from one point on earth to another; the radio transmitter was meant to study the properties of radio wave distribution throughout the ionosphere. The launch of Sputnik 1 was a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development, and marks the beginning of the Space Age.  Early active and passive satellite experiments  There are two major classes of communications satellites, passive and active. Passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward the direction of the receiver. With passive satellites, the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. Passive satellites were the first communications satellites, but are little used now. Work that was begun in the field of electrical intelligence gathering at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in 1951 led to a project named Communication Moon Relay. Military planners had long shown considerable interest in secure and reliable communications lines as a tactical necessity, and the ultimate goal of this project was the creation of the longest communications circuit in human history, with the moon, Earth's natural satellite, acting as a passive relay. After achieving the first transoceanic communication between Washington, D.C., and Hawaii on 23 January 1956, this system was publicly inaugurated and put into formal production in January 1960. The first satellite purpose built to actively relay communications was Project SCORE, led by Advanced Research Projects Agency and launched on 18 December 1958, which used a tape recorder to carry a stored voice message, as well as to receive, store, and retransmit messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The satellite also executed several realtime transmissions before the non rechargeable batteries failed on 30 December 1958 after eight hours of actual operation.The direct successor to SCORE was another ARPA led project called Courier. Courier 1B was launched on 4 October 1960 to explore whether it would be possible to establish a global military communications network by using delayed repeater satellites, which receive and store information until commanded to rebroadcast them. After 17 days, a command system failure ended communications from the satellite.NASA's satellite applications program launched the first artificial satellite used for passive relay communications in Echo 1 on 12 August 1960. Echo 1 was an aluminized balloon satellite acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals. Communication signals were bounced off the satellite from one point on Earth to another. This experiment sought to establish the feasibility of worldwide broadcasts of telephone, radio, and television signals.  More firsts and further experiments  Telstar was the first active, direct relay communications commercial satellite and marked the first transatlantic transmission of television signals. Belonging to AT T as part of a multi national agreement between AT T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on 10 July 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch.Another passive relay experiment primarily intended for military communications purposes was Project West Ford, which was led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory. After an initial failure in 1961, a launch on 9 May 1963 dispersed 350 million copper needle dipoles to create a passive reflecting belt. Even though only about half of the dipoles properly separated from each other, the project was able to successfully experiment and communicate using frequencies in the SHF X band spectrum.An immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the Hughes Aircraft Company's Syncom 2, launched on 26 July 1963. Syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit. It revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed, but because it still had north south motion, special equipment was needed to track it. Its successor, Syncom 3, launched on 19 July 1964, was the first geostationary communications satellite. Syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit, without a north south motion, making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.A direct extension of the passive experiments of Project West Ford was the Lincoln Experimental Satellite program, also conducted by the Lincoln Laboratory on behalf of the United States Department of Defense. The LES 1 active communications satellite was launched on 11 February 1965 to explore the feasibility of active solid state X band long range military communications. A total of nine satellites were launched between 1965 and 1976 as part of this series.  International commercial satellite projects  In the United States, 1962 saw the creation of the Communications Satellite Corporation private corporation, which was subject to instruction by the US Government on matters of national policy. Over the next two years, international negotiations led to the Intelsat Agreements, which in turn led to the launch of Intelsat 1, also known as Early Bird, on 6 April 1965, and which was the first commercial communications satellite to be placed in geosynchronous orbit. Subsequent Intelsat launches in the 1960s provided multi destination service and video, audio, and data service to ships at sea , and the completion of a fully global network with Intelsat 3 in 1969 70. By the 1980s, with significant expansions in commercial satellite capacity, Intelsat was on its way to become part of the competitive private telecommunications industry, and had started to get competition from the likes of PanAmSat in the United States, which, ironically, was then bought by its archrival in 2005.When Intelsat was launched, the United States was the only launch source outside of the Soviet Union, who did not participate in the Intelsat agreements. The Soviet Union launched its first communications satellite on 23 April 1965 as part of the Molniya program. This program was also unique at the time for its use of what then became known as the Molniya orbit, which describes a highly elliptical orbit, with two high apogees daily over the northern hemisphere. This orbit provides a long dwell time over Russian territory as well as over Canada at higher latitudes than geostationary orbits over the equator.  Satellite orbits  Communications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit, while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details. MEO and LEO are non geostationary orbit . Geostationary satellites have a geostationary orbit , which is 22,236 miles from Earth's surface. This orbit has the special characteristic that the apparent position of the satellite in the sky when viewed by a ground observer does not change, the satellite appears to stand still in the sky. This is because the satellite's orbital period is the same as the rotation rate of the Earth. The advantage of this orbit is that ground antennas do not have to track the satellite across the sky, they can be fixed to point at the location in the sky the satellite appears. Medium Earth orbit satellites are closer to Earth. Orbital altitudes range from 2,000 to 36,000 kilometres above Earth. The region below medium orbits is referred to as low Earth orbit , and is about 160 to 2,000 kilometres above Earth.As satellites in MEO and LEO orbit the Earth faster, they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on Earth continually like a geostationary satellite, but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and set when they go behind the Earth beyond the visible horizon. Therefore, to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites, so that one of these satellites will always be visible in the sky for transmission of communication signals. However, due to their relatively small distance to the Earth their signals are stronger.  Low Earth orbit  A low Earth orbit typically is a circular orbit about 160 to 2,000 kilometres above the earth's surface and, correspondingly, a period of about 90 minutes.Because of their low altitude, these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1,000 kilometres from the sub satellite point. In addition, satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly. So even for local applications, many satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity. Low Earth orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and, due to proximity to the ground, do not require as high signal strength . Thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost. In addition, there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.  Satellite constellation  A group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation. Two such constellations, intended to provide satellite phone and low speed data services, primarily to remote areas, are the Iridium and Globalstar systems. The Iridium system has 66 satellites, which orbital inclination of 86.4 and inter satellite links provide service availability over the entire surface of Earth. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by SpaceX, that aims for global satellite Internet access coverage. It is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low Earth orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of Earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part. This will be the case with the CASCADE system of Canada's CASSIOPE communications satellite. Another system using this store and forward method is Orbcomm.  Medium Earth orbit  A medium Earth orbit is a satellite in orbit somewhere between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometres above the earth's surface. MEO satellites are similar to LEO satellites in functionality. MEO satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than LEO satellites, usually between 2 and 8 hours. MEO satellites have a larger coverage area than LEO satellites. A MEO satellite's longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a MEO network than a LEO network. One disadvantage is that a MEO satellite's distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a LEO satellite, although these limitations are not as severe as those of a GEO satellite. Like LEOs, these satellites do not maintain a stationary distance from the earth. This is in contrast to the geostationary orbit, where satellites are always 35,786 kilometres from the earth. Typically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about 16,000 kilometres above earth. In various patterns, these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.  Examples of MEO  In 1962, the communications satellite, Telstar, was launched. It was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high speed telephone signals. Although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realised. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth's rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage. In 2013, the first four of a constellation of 20 MEO satellites was launched. The O3b satellites provide broadband internet services, in particular to remote locations and maritime and in flight use, and orbit at an altitude of 8,063 kilometres .  Geostationary orbit  To an observer on Earth, a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless, in a fixed position in the sky. This is because it revolves around the Earth at Earth's own angular velocity . A geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellite's motion. This is relatively inexpensive. In applications that require many ground antennas, such as DirecTV distribution, the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.  Examples of GEO  The first geostationary satellite was Syncom 3, launched on 19 August 1964, and used for communication across the Pacific starting with television coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics. Shortly after Syncom 3, Intelsat I, aka Early Bird, was launched on 6 April 1965 and placed in orbit at 28 west longitude. It was the first geostationary satellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean. On 9 November 1972, Canada's first geostationary satellite serving the continent, Anik A1, was launched by Telesat Canada, with the United States following suit with the launch of Westar 1 by Western Union on 13 April 1974. On 30 May 1974, the first geostationary communications satellite in the world to be three axis stabilized was launched: the experimental satellite ATS 6 built for NASA. After the launches of the Telstar through Westar 1 satellites, RCA Americom launched Satcom 1 in 1975. It was Satcom 1 that was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels such as WTBS , HBO, CBN and The Weather Channel become successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast television networks in the United States, like ABC, NBC, and CBS, to distribute programming to their local affiliate stations. Satcom 1 was widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 in America , resulting in lower transponder usage costs. Satellites in later decades tended to have even higher transponder numbers.By 2000, Hughes Space and Communications had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide. Other major satellite manufacturers include Space Systems Loral, Orbital Sciences Corporation with the Star Bus series, Indian Space Research Organisation, Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman, Alcatel Space, now Thales Alenia Space, with the Spacebus series, and Astrium.  Molniya orbit  Geostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator. This will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes, affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference . Thus, for areas close to the North Pole, a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, Molniya orbit satellites have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem. Molniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases. The Molniya orbit is highly inclined, guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit. The Molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes, during which its ground footprint moves only slightly. Its period is one half day, so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution. In this way a constellation of three Molniya satellites can provide uninterrupted coverage. The first satellite of the Molniya series was launched on 23 April 1965 and was used for experimental transmission of TV signals from a Moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in Siberia and the Russian Far East, in Norilsk, Khabarovsk, Magadan and Vladivostok. In November 1967 Soviet engineers created a unique system of national TV network of satellite television, called Orbita, that was based on Molniya satellites.  Polar orbit  In the United States, the National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations of NASA NOAA . NPOESS manages a number of satellites for various purposes; for example, METSAT for meteorological satellite, EUMETSAT for the European branch of the program, and METOP for meteorological operations. These orbits are sun synchronous, meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day. For example, the satellites in the NPOESS orbit will cross the equator, going from south to north, at times 1:30 P.M., 5:30 P.M., and 9:30 P.M.  Structure Communications Satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems: Communication Payload, normally composed of transponders, antennas, and switching systems Engines used to bring the satellite to its desired orbit A station keeping tracking and stabilization subsystem used to keep the satellite in the right orbit, with its antennas pointed in the right direction, and its power system pointed towards the sun Power subsystem, used to power the Satellite systems, normally composed of solar cells, and batteries that maintain power during solar eclipse Command and Control subsystem, which maintains communications with ground control stations. The ground control Earth stations monitor the satellite performance and control its functionality during various phases of its life cycle.The bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite. Each service requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission. This is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value.  Frequency allocation for satellite systems Allocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning. This is carried out under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union . To facilitate frequency planning, the world is divided into three regions: Region 1: Europe, Africa, the Middle East, what was formerly the Soviet Union, and Mongolia Region 2: North and South America and Greenland Region 3: Asia , Australia, and the southwest PacificWithin these regions, frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services, although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions. Some of the services provided by satellites are: Fixed satellite service Broadcasting satellite service Mobile satellite service Radionavigation satellite service Meteorological satellite service  Applications   Telephony  The first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony. The fixed Public Switched Telephone Network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station, where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite. The downlink follows an analogous path. Improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century. Satellite communications are still used in many applications today. Remote islands such as Ascension Island, Saint Helena, Diego Garcia, and Easter Island, where no submarine cables are in service, need satellite telephones. There are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to non existent, for example large regions of South America, Africa, Canada, China, Russia, and Australia. Satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of Antarctica and Greenland. Other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea, a backup for hospitals, military, and recreation. Ships at sea, as well as planes, often use satellite phones.Satellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means. On a large scale, often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area. There are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system. In this example, almost any type of satellite can be used. Satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low Earth orbit satellites. Calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the Public Switched Telephone Network .  Television  As television became the main market, its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats. Two satellite types are used for North American television and radio: Direct broadcast satellite , and Fixed Service Satellite . The definitions of FSS and DBS satellites outside of North America, especially in Europe, are a bit more ambiguous. Most satellites used for direct to home television in Europe have the same high power output as DBS class satellites in North America, but use the same linear polarization as FSS class satellites. Examples of these are the Astra, Eutelsat, and Hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the European continent. Because of this, the terms FSS and DBS are more so used throughout the North American continent, and are uncommon in Europe. Fixed Service Satellites use the C band, and the lower portions of the Ku band. They are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations , as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities, business television , Videoconferencing, and general commercial telecommunications. FSS satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends. Free to air satellite TV channels are also usually distributed on FSS satellites in the Ku band. The Intelsat Americas 5, Galaxy 10R and AMC 3 satellites over North America provide a quite large amount of FTA channels on their Ku band transponders. The American Dish Network DBS service has also recently used FSS technology as well for their programming packages requiring their SuperDish antenna, due to Dish Network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the FCC's must carry regulations, and for more bandwidth to carry HDTV channels. A direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small DBS satellite dishes . Direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave Ku band. DBS technology is used for DTH oriented satellite TV services, such as DirecTV, DISH Network and Orby TV in the United States, Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct in Canada, Freesat and Sky in the UK, Ireland, and New Zealand and DSTV in South Africa. Operating at lower frequency and lower power than DBS, FSS satellites require a much larger dish for reception in diameter for Ku band, and 12 feet or larger for C band . They use linear polarization for each of the transponders' RF input and output , but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice. FSS satellite technology was also originally used for DTH satellite TV from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the United States in the form of TVRO receivers and dishes. It was also used in its Ku band form for the now defunct Primestar satellite TV service. Some satellites have been launched that have transponders in the Ka band, such as DirecTV's SPACEWAY 1 satellite, and Anik F2. NASA and ISRO have also launched experimental satellites carrying Ka band beacons recently.Some manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using Global Positioning System technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV , which passengers can view on board on LCD screens mounted in the seats.  Radio broadcasting  Satellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries, notably the United States. Mobile services allow listeners to roam a consextinent, listening to the same audio programming anywhere. A satellite radio or subscription radio is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite, which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.  Amateur radio  Amateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites, which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic. Most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters, and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with UHF or VHF radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as Yagis or dish antennas. Due to launch costs, most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low Earth orbits, and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time. Some satellites also provide data forwarding services using the X.25 or similar protocols.  Internet access  After the 1990s, satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the Internet via broadband data connections. This can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas, and cannot access a broadband connection, or require high availability of services.  Military  Communications satellites are used for military communications applications, such as Global Command and Control Systems. Examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the MILSTAR, the DSCS, and the FLTSATCOM of the United States, NATO satellites, United Kingdom satellites , and satellites of the former Soviet Union. India has launched its first Military Communication satellite GSAT 7, its transponders operate in UHF, F, C and Ku band bands. Typically military satellites operate in the UHF, SHF or EHF frequency bands.  Data collection  Near ground in situ environmental monitoring equipment , may use satellites for one way data transmission or two way telemetry and telecontrol. It may be based on a secondary payload of a weather satellite or in dedicated satellites . The data rate is typically much lower than in satellite Internet access.

            "text": "A commutator is a rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine. Two or more electrical contacts called brushes made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator, making sliding contact with successive segments of the commutator as it rotates. The windings on the armature are connected to the commutator segments. Commutators are used in direct current machines: dynamos and many DC motors as well as universal motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady rotating force is produced. In a generator the commutator picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing the direction of the current with each half turn, serving as a mechanical rectifier to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit. The first direct current commutator type machine, the dynamo, was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, based on a suggestion by Andr Marie Amp re. Commutators are relatively inefficient, and also require periodic maintenance such as brush replacement. Therefore, commutated machines are declining in use, being replaced by alternating current machines, and in recent years by brushless DC motors which use semiconductor switches.  Principle of operation  A commutator consists of a set of contact bars fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single armature winding, when the shaft has made one half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the armature winding through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and generator case, the commutator periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.  Simplest practical commutator  Practical commutators have at least three contact segments, to prevent a dead spot where two brushes simultaneously bridge only two commutator segments. Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop in a position where two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.  Ring segment construction  A commutator consists of a set of copper segments, fixed around the part of the circumference of the rotating machine, or the rotor, and a set of spring loaded brushes fixed to the stationary frame of the machine. Two or more fixed brushes connect to the external circuit, either a source of current for a motor or a load for a generator. Commutator segments are connected to the coils of the armature, with the number of coils depending on the speed and voltage of the machine. Large motors may have hundreds of segments. Each conducting segment of the commutator is insulated from adjacent segments. Mica was used on early machines and is still used on large machines. Many other insulating materials are used to insulate smaller machines; plastics allow quick manufacture of an insulator, for example. The segments are held onto the shaft using a dovetail shape on the edges or underside of each segment. Insulating wedges around the perimeter of each segment are pressed so that the commutator maintains its mechanical stability throughout its normal operating range. In small appliance and tool motors the segments are typically crimped permanently in place and cannot be removed. When the motor fails it is discarded and replaced. On large industrial machines it is economical to replace individual damaged segments, and so the end wedge can be unscrewed and individual segments removed and replaced. Replacing the copper and mica segments is commonly referred to as refilling . Refillable dovetailed commutators are the most common construction of larger industrial type commutators, but refillable commutators may also be constructed using external bands made of fiberglass or forged steel rings . Disposable, molded type commutators commonly found in smaller DC motors are becoming increasingly more common in larger electric motors. Molded type commutators are not repairable and must be replaced if damaged. In addition to the commonly used heat, torque, and tonnage methods of seasoning commutators, some high performance commutator applications require a more expensive, specific spin seasoning process or over speed spin testing to guarantee stability of the individual segments and prevent premature wear of the carbon brushes. Such requirements are common with traction, military, aerospace, nuclear, mining, and high speed applications where clamping failure and segment or insulation protrusion can lead to serious negative consequences. Friction between the segments and the brushes eventually causes wear to both surfaces. Carbon brushes, being made of a softer material, wear faster and may be designed to be replaced easily without dismantling the machine. Older copper brushes caused more wear to the commutator, causing deep grooving and notching of the surface over time. The commutator on small motors is not designed to be repaired through the life of the device. On large industrial equipment, the commutator may be re surfaced with abrasives, or the rotor may be removed from the frame, mounted in a large metal lathe, and the commutator resurfaced by cutting it down to a smaller diameter. The largest of equipment can include a lathe turning attachment directly over the commutator.  Brush construction  Early machines used brushes made from strands of copper wire to contact the surface of the commutator. However, these hard metal brushes tended to scratch and groove the smooth commutator segments, eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between commutator segments, shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes. Modern rotating machines with commutators almost exclusively use carbon brushes, which may have copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes can be found in toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive starter motors. Motors and generators suffer from a phenomenon known as 'armature reaction', one of the effects of which is to change the position at which the current reversal through the windings should ideally take place as the loading varies. Early machines had the brushes mounted on a ring that was provided with a handle. During operation, it was necessary to adjust the position of the brush ring to adjust the commutation to minimise the sparking at the brushes. This process was known as 'rocking the brushes'. Various developments took place to automate the process of adjusting the commutation and minimizing the sparking at the brushes. One of these was the development of 'high resistance brushes', or brushes made from a mixture of copper powder and carbon. Although described as high resistance brushes, the resistance of such a brush was of the order of milliohms, the exact value dependent on the size and function of the machine. Also, the high resistance brush was not constructed like a brush but in the form of a carbon block with a curved face to match the shape of the commutator. The high resistance or carbon brush is made large enough that it is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans . The result of this is that as the commutator segment passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush. The introduction of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the commutator segments. The ratio of copper to carbon can be changed for a particular purpose. Brushes with higher copper content perform better with very low voltages and high current, while brushes with a higher carbon content are better for high voltage and low current. High copper content brushes typically carry 150 to 200 amperes per square inch of contact surface, while higher carbon content only carries 40 to 70 amperes per square inch. The higher resistance of carbon also results in a greater voltage drop of 0.8 to 1.0 volts per contact, or 1.6 to 2.0 volts across the commutator.  Brush holders  A spring is typically used with the brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the brush and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the brush wears small and thin enough that steady contact is no longer possible or it is no longer securely held in the brush holder, and so the brush must be replaced. It is common for a flexible power cable to be directly attached to the brush, because current flowing through the support spring would cause heating, which may lead to a loss of metal temper and a loss of the spring tension. When a commutated motor or generator uses more power than a single brush is capable of conducting, an assembly of several brush holders is mounted in parallel across the surface of the very large commutator. This parallel holder distributes current evenly across all the brushes, and permits a careful operator to remove a bad brush and replace it with a new one, even as the machine continues to spin fully powered and under load. High power, high current commutated equipment is now uncommon, due to the less complex design of alternating current generators that permits a low current, high voltage spinning field coil to energize high current fixed position stator coils. This permits the use of very small singular brushes in the alternator design. In this instance, the rotating contacts are continuous rings, called slip rings, and no switching happens. Modern devices using carbon brushes usually have a maintenance free design that requires no adjustment throughout the life of the device, using a fixed position brush holder slot and a combined brush spring cable assembly that fits into the slot. The worn brush is pulled out and a new brush inserted.  Brush contact angle  The different brush types make contact with the commutator in different ways. Because copper brushes have the same hardness as the commutator segments, the rotor cannot be spun backwards against the ends of copper brushes without the copper digging into the segments and causing severe damage. Consequently, strip laminate copper brushes only make tangential contact with the commutator, while copper mesh and wire brushes use an inclined contact angle touching their edge across the segments of a commutator that can spin in only one direction. The softness of carbon brushes permits direct radial end contact with the commutator without damage to the segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial contact brushes. In the case of a reaction type carbon brush holder, carbon brushes may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.  The commutating plane  The contact point where a brush touches the commutator is referred to as the commutating plane. To conduct sufficient current to or from the commutator, the brush contact area is not a thin line but instead a rectangular patch across the segments. Typically the brush is wide enough to span 2.5 commutator segments. This means that two adjacent segments are electrically connected by the brush when it contacts both.  Rotation of brushes for stator field distortion  Most introductions to motor and generator design start with a simple two pole device with the brushes arranged at a perfect 90 degree angle from the field. This ideal is useful as a starting point for understanding how the fields interact but it is not how a motor or generator functions in actual practice. In a real motor or generator, the field around the rotor is never perfectly uniform. Instead, the rotation of the rotor induces field effects which drag and distort the magnetic lines of the outer non rotating stator. The faster the rotor spins, the further this degree of field distortion. Because a motor or generator operates most efficiently with the rotor field at right angles to the stator field, it is necessary to either retard or advance the brush position to put the rotor's field into the correct position to be at a right angle to the distorted field. These field effects are reversed when the direction of spin is reversed. It is therefore difficult to build an efficient reversible commutated dynamo, since for highest field strength it is necessary to move the brushes to the opposite side of the normal neutral plane. These effects can be mitigated by a compensation winding in the face of the field pole that carries armature current. The effect can be considered to be analogous to timing advance in an internal combustion engine. Generally a dynamo that has been designed to run at a certain fixed speed will have its brushes permanently fixed to align the field for highest efficiency at that speed.  Further compensation for self induction  Self induction The magnetic fields in each coil of wire join and compound together to create a magnetic field that resists changes in the current, which can be likened to the current having inertia. In the coils of the rotor, even after the brush has been reached, currents tend to continue to flow for a brief moment, resulting in a wasted energy as heat due to the brush spanning across several commutator segments and the current short circuiting across the segments. Spurious resistance is an apparent increase in the resistance in the armature winding, which is proportional to the speed of the armature, and is due to the lagging of the current. To minimize sparking at the brushes due to this short circuiting, the brushes are advanced a few degrees further yet, beyond the advance for field distortions. This moves the rotor winding undergoing commutation slightly forward into the stator field which has magnetic lines in the opposite direction and which oppose the field in the stator. This opposing field helps to reverse the lagging self inducting current in the stator. So even for a rotor which is at rest and initially requires no compensation for spinning field distortions, the brushes should still be advanced beyond the perfect 90 degree angle as taught in so many beginners textbooks, to compensate for self induction.  Use of interpoles to correct field distortions  Modern motor and generator devices with commutators are able to counteract armature reaction through the use of interpoles, which are small field coils and pole pieces positioned approximately halfway between the primary poles of the stator. By applying a dynamic varying field to the interpoles as the load, RPM, or direction of rotation of the device changes, it is possible to balance out field distortions from armature reaction so that the brush position can remain fixed and sparking across the segments is minimized.  Limitations and alternatives  Although direct current motors and dynamos once dominated industry, the disadvantages of the commutator have caused a decline in the use of commutated machines in the last century. These disadvantages are: The sliding friction between the brushes and commutator consumes power, which can be significant in a low power machine. Due to friction, the brushes and copper commutator segments wear down, creating dust. In small consumer products such as power tools and appliances the brushes may last as long as the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of brushes and occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in low particulate or sealed applications or in equipment that must operate for long periods without maintenance. The resistance of the sliding contact between brush and commutator causes a voltage drop called the brush drop . This may be several volts, so it can cause large power losses in low voltage, high current machines. Alternating current motors, which do not use commutators, are much more efficient. There is a limit to the maximum current density and voltage which can be switched with a commutator. Very large direct current machines, say, more than several megawatts rating, cannot be built with commutators. The largest motors and generators are all alternating current machines. The switching action of the commutator causes sparking at the contacts, posing a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres, and generating electromagnetic interference.With the wide availability of alternating current, DC motors have been replaced by more efficient AC synchronous or induction motors. In recent years, with the widespread availability of power semiconductors, in many remaining applications commutated DC motors have been replaced with brushless direct current motors . These don't have a commutator; instead the direction of the current is switched electronically. A sensor keeps track of the rotor position and semiconductor switches such as transistors reverse the current. Operating life of these machines is much longer, limited mainly by bearing wear.  Repulsion induction motors  These are single phase AC only motors with higher starting torque than could be obtained with split phase starting windings, before high capacitance starting capacitors became practical. They have a conventional wound stator as with any induction motor, but the wire wound rotor is much like that with a conventional commutator. Brushes opposite each other are connected to each other , and transformer action induces currents into the rotor that develop torque by repulsion. One variety, notable for having an adjustable speed, runs continuously with brushes in contact, while another uses repulsion only for high starting torque and in some cases lifts the brushes once the motor is running fast enough. In the latter case, all commutator segments are connected together as well, before the motor attains running speed. Once at speed, the rotor windings become functionally equivalent to the squirrel cage structure of a conventional induction motor, and the motor runs as such.  Laboratory commutators Commutators were used as simple forward off reverse switches for electrical experiments in physics laboratories. There are two well known historical types:  Ruhmkorff commutator  This is similar in design to the commutators used in motors and dynamos. It was usually constructed of brass and ivory .  Pohl commutator  This consisted of a block of wood or ebonite with four wells, containing mercury, which were cross connected by copper wires. The output was taken from a pair of curved copper wires which were moved to dip into one or other pair of mercury wells. Instead of mercury, ionic liquids or other liquid metals could be used.

            "text": "A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies. The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialised or general purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses, and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes, rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol. Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanism, and organizational intent. Computer networks support many applications and services, such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications.  History Computer networking may be considered a branch of computer science, computer engineering, and telecommunications, since it relies on the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines. Computer networking was influenced by a wide array of technology developments and historical milestones. In the late 1950s, a network of computers was built for the U.S. military Semi Automatic Ground Environment radar system using the Bell 101 modem. It was the first commercial modem for computers, released by AT T Corporation in 1958. The modem allowed digital data to be transmitted over regular unconditioned telephone lines at a speed of 110 bits per second . In 1959, Christopher Strachey filed a patent application for time sharing and John McCarthy initiated the first project to implement time sharing of user programs at MIT. Stratchey passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris that year. McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the earliest time sharing systems . In 1959, Anatoly Kitov proposed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a detailed plan for the re organisation of the control of the Soviet armed forces and of the Soviet economy on the basis of a network of computing centres. Kitov's proposal was rejected, as later was the 1962 OGAS economy management network project. In 1960, the commercial airline reservation system semi automatic business research environment went online with two connected mainframes. In 1963, J. C. R. Licklider sent a memorandum to office colleagues discussing the concept of the Intergalactic Computer Network , a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users. Throughout the 1960s, Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed the concept of packet switching to transfer information between computers over a network. Davies pioneered the implementation of the concept. The NPL network, a local area network at the National Physical Laboratory used a line speed of 768 kbit s and later high speed T1 links . In 1965, Western Electric introduced the first widely used telephone switch that implemented computer control in the switching fabric. In 1969, the first four nodes of the ARPANET were connected using 50 kbit s circuits between the University of California at Los Angeles, the Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. In the early 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock carried out mathematical work to model the performance of packet switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today. In 1972, commercial services were first deployed on public data networks in Europe, which began using X.25 in the late 1970s and spread across the globe. The underlying infrastructure was used for expanding TCP IP networks in the 1980s. In 1973, the French CYCLADES network was the first to make the hosts responsible for the reliable delivery of data, rather than this being a centralized service of the network itself. In 1973, Robert Metcalfe wrote a formal memo at Xerox PARC describing Ethernet, a networking system that was based on the Aloha network, developed in the 1960s by Norman Abramson and colleagues at the University of Hawaii. In July 1976, Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs published their paper Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks and collaborated on several patents received in 1977 and 1978. In 1974, Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine published the Transmission Control Protocol specification, RFC 675, coining the term Internet as a shorthand for internetworking. In 1976, John Murphy of Datapoint Corporation created ARCNET, a token passing network first used to share storage devices. In 1977, the first long distance fiber network was deployed by GTE in Long Beach, California. In 1977, Xerox Network Systems was developed by Robert Metcalfe and Yogen Dalal at Xerox. In 1979, Robert Metcalfe pursued making Ethernet an open standard. In 1980, Ethernet was upgraded from the original 2.94 Mbit s protocol to the 10 Mbit s protocol, which was developed by Ron Crane, Bob Garner, Roy Ogus, and Yogen Dalal. In 1995, the transmission speed capacity for Ethernet increased from 10 Mbit s to 100 Mbit s. By 1998, Ethernet supported transmission speeds of 1 Gbit s. Subsequently, higher speeds of up to 400 Gbit s were added . The scaling of Ethernet has been a contributing factor to its continued use.  Use A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.  Network packet  Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet switched network. Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data . The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between. With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free. The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit . A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.  Network topology  The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of network hosts. Common layouts are: Bus network: all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although modern physical layer variants use point to point links instead, forming a star or a tree. Star network: all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a small switched Ethernet LAN, where each client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless LAN, where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access point. Ring network: each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the Fiber Distributed Data Interface , made use of such a topology. Mesh network: each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other. Fully connected network: each node is connected to every other node in the network. Tree network: nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without redundant meshing.The physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with FDDI, the network topology is a ring, but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location. Physical layout is not completely irrelevant, however, as common ducting and equipment locations can represent single points of failure due to issues like fires, power failures and flooding.  Overlay network  An overlay network is a virtual network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many peer to peer networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using modems before any data network existed. The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network. Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. Address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network. Another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table, which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table indexed by keys. Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through quality of service guarantees achieve higher quality streaming media. Previous proposals such as IntServ, DiffServ, and IP multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network. On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from Internet service providers. The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination. For example, Akamai Technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery . Academic research includes end system multicast, resilient routing and quality of service studies, among others.  Network links  The transmission media used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable, optical fiber, and free space. In the OSI model, the software to handle the media is defined at layers 1 and 2 the physical layer and the data link layer. A widely adopted family that uses copper and fiber media in local area network technology are collectively known as Ethernet. The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by IEEE 802.3. Wireless LAN standards use radio waves, others use infrared signals as a transmission medium. Power line communication uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.  Wired  The following classes of wired technologies are used in computer networking. Coaxial cable is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work sites for local area networks. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second. ITU T G.hn technology uses existing home wiring to create a high speed local area network. Twisted pair cabling is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission speed ranges from 2 Mbit s to 10 Gbit s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair and shielded twisted pair . Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios. An optical fiber is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea communications cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber optics, single mode optical fiber and multi mode optical fiber . Single mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.  Wireless  Network connections can be established wirelessly using radio or other electromagnetic means of communication. Terrestrial microwave Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line of sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40 miles apart. Communications satellites Satellites also communicate via microwave. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km above the equator. These Earth orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals. Cellular networks use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area is served by a low power transceiver. Radio and spread spectrum technologies Wireless LANs use a high frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open standards wireless radio wave technology known as Wi Fi. Free space optical communication uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, line of sight propagation is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices. Extending the Internet to interplanetary dimensions via radio waves and optical means, the Interplanetary Internet. IP over Avian Carriers was a humorous April fool's Request for Comments, issued as RFC 1149. It was implemented in real life in 2001.The last two cases have a large round trip delay time, which gives slow two way communication but doesn't prevent sending large amounts of information .  Network nodes  Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers , repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks and so may perform multiple functions.  Network interfaces  A network interface controller is computer hardware that connects the computer to the network media and has the ability to process low level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry. In Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media Access Control address usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.  Repeaters and hubs  A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart. Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network, e.g., the Ethernet 5 4 3 rule. An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.  Bridges and switches  Network bridges and network switches are distinct from a hub in that they only forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub forwards to all ports. Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be thought of as a multi port bridge. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional switches. Bridges and switches operate at the data link layer of the OSI model and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on the destination MAC address in each frame. They learn the association of physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source, and discovers the location from the reply. Bridges and switches divide the network's collision domain but maintain a single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.  Routers  A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.  Modems  Modems are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission. Early modems modulated audio signals sent over a standard voice telephone line. Modems are still commonly used for telephone lines, using a digital subscriber line technology and cable television systems using DOCSIS technology.  Firewalls  A firewall is a network device or software for controlling network security and access rules. Firewalls are inserted in connections between secure internal networks and potentially insecure external networks such as the Internet. Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks.  Communication protocols  A communication protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over a network. Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be connection oriented or connectionless, they may use circuit mode or packet switching, and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing. In a protocol stack, often constructed per the OSI model, communications functions are divided up into protocol layers, where each layer leverages the services of the layer below it until the lowest layer controls the hardware that sends information across the media. The use of protocol layering is ubiquitous across the field of computer networking. An important example of a protocol stack is HTTP running over TCP over IP over IEEE 802.11 . This stack is used between the wireless router and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web. There are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.  Common protocols   Internet Protocol Suite  The Internet Protocol Suite, also called TCP IP, is the foundation of all modern networking. It offers connection less and connection oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by datagram transmission using Internet protocol . At its core, the protocol suite defines the addressing, identification, and routing specifications for Internet Protocol Version 4 and for IPv6, the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability. The Internet Protocol Suite is the defining set of protocols for the Internet.  IEEE 802  IEEE 802 is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. The complete IEEE 802 protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model. For example, MAC bridging deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a Spanning Tree Protocol. IEEE 802.1Q describes VLANs, and IEEE 802.1X defines a port based Network Access Control protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs  it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a wireless access key .   Ethernet  Ethernet is a family of technologies used in wired LANs. It is described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3 published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.   Wireless LAN  Wireless LAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standards, also widely known as WLAN or WiFi, is probably the most well known member of the IEEE 802 protocol family for home users today. IEEE 802.11 shares many properties with wired Ethernet.  SONET SDH  Synchronous optical networking and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support circuit switched digital telephony. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport oriented features, SONET SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting Asynchronous Transfer Mode frames.  Asynchronous Transfer Mode  Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous time division multiplexing and encodes data into small, fixed sized cells. This differs from other protocols such as the Internet Protocol Suite or Ethernet that use variable sized packets or frames. ATM has similarities with both circuit and packet switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high throughput data traffic, and real time, low latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins. ATM still plays a role in the last mile, which is the connection between an Internet service provider and the home user.  Cellular standards  There are a number of different digital cellular standards, including: Global System for Mobile Communications , General Packet Radio Service , cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Evolution Data Optimized , Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution , Universal Mobile Telecommunications System , Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications , Digital AMPS , and Integrated Digital Enhanced Network .  Routing  Routing is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks. In packet switched networks, routing protocols direct packet forwarding through intermediate nodes. Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. General purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing, though because they lack specialized hardware, may offer limited performance. The routing process directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables, which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. Multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths. Routing can be contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, the structured addressing used by routers outperforms unstructured addressing used by bridging. Structured IP addresses are used on the Internet. Unstructured MAC addresses are used for bridging on Ethernet and similar local area networks.  Geographic scale Networks may be characterized by many properties or features, such as physical capacity, organizational purpose, user authorization, access rights, and others. Another distinct classification method is that of the physical extent or geographic scale. Nanoscale networkA nanoscale network has key components implemented at the nanoscale, including message carriers, and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for other communication techniques. Personal area networkA personal area network is a computer network used for communication among computers and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters. A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN. Local area networkA local area network is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Wired LANs are most commonly based on Ethernet technology. Other networking technologies such as ITU T G.hn also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.A LAN can be connected to a wide area network using a router. The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a WAN, include higher data transfer rates, limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other IEEE 802.3 LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to and in excess of 100 Gbit s, standardized by IEEE in 2010. Home area networkA home area network is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable Internet access or digital subscriber line provider. Storage area networkA storage area network is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the storage appears as locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium sized business environments. Campus area networkA campus area network is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment and transmission media are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant owner . For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls. Backbone networkA backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area. For example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. When designing a network backbone, network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it. Another example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone, which is a massive, global system of fiber optic cable and optical networking that carry the bulk of data between wide area networks , metro, regional, national and transoceanic networks. Metropolitan area networkA metropolitan area network is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus. Wide area networkA wide area network is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and airwaves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI reference model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer. Enterprise private networkAn enterprise private network is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations so they can share computer resources. Virtual private networkA virtual private network is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features. VPN may have best effort performance or may have a defined service level agreement between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point to point. Global area networkA global area network is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless LANs.  Organizational scope Networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets. They may also provide network access to the Internet, which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity.  Intranet  An intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. The intranet uses the IP protocol and IP based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits the use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.  Extranet  An extranet is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization but supports a limited connection to a specific external network. For example, an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers. These other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint. Network connection to an extranet is often, but not always, implemented via WAN technology.  Internet  An internetwork is the connection of multiple different types of computer networks to form a single computer network by layering on top of the different networking software and connecting them together using routers. The Internet is the largest example of internetwork. It is a global system of interconnected governmental, academic, corporate, public, and private computer networks. It is based on the networking technologies of the Internet Protocol Suite. It is the successor of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network developed by DARPA of the United States Department of Defense. The Internet utilizes copper communications and the optical networking backbone to enable the World Wide Web , the Internet of Things, video transfer, and a broad range of information services. Participants on the Internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented, and often standardized, protocols compatible with the Internet Protocol Suite and an addressing system administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority and address registries. Service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the Border Gateway Protocol , forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths.  Darknet  A darknet is an overlay network, typically running on the Internet, that is only accessible through specialized software. A darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peers sometimes called friends  using non standard protocols and ports. Darknets are distinct from other distributed peer to peer networks as sharing is anonymous , and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference.  Network service Network services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network, to provide some functionality for members or users of the network, or to help the network itself to operate. The World Wide Web, E mail, printing and network file sharing are examples of well known network services. Network services such as DNS give names for IP and MAC addresses , and DHCP to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid IP address.Services are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service.  Network performance   Bandwidth  Bandwidth in bit s may refer to consumed bandwidth, corresponding to achieved throughput or goodput, i.e., the average rate of successful data transfer through a communication path. The throughput is affected by technologies such as bandwidth shaping, bandwidth management, bandwidth throttling, bandwidth cap, bandwidth allocation , etc. A bit stream's bandwidth is proportional to the average consumed signal bandwidth in hertz during a studied time interval.  Network delay  Network delay is a design and performance characteristic of a telecommunications network. It specifies the latency for a bit of data to travel across the network from one communication endpoint to another. It is typically measured in multiples or fractions of a second. Delay may differ slightly, depending on the location of the specific pair of communicating endpoints. Engineers usually report both the maximum and average delay, and they divide the delay into several parts: Processing delay time it takes a router to process the packet header Queuing delay time the packet spends in routing queues Transmission delay time it takes to push the packet's bits onto the link Propagation delay time for a signal to propagate through the mediaA certain minimum level of delay is experienced by signals due to the time it takes to transmit a packet serially through a link. This delay is extended by more variable levels of delay due to network congestion. IP network delays can range from a few milliseconds to several hundred milliseconds.  Quality of service  Depending on the installation requirements, network performance is usually measured by the quality of service of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include throughput, jitter, bit error rate and latency. The following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit switched network and one type of packet switched network, viz. ATM: Circuit switched networks: In circuit switched networks, network performance is synonymous with the grade of service. The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads. Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo. ATM: In an Asynchronous Transfer Mode network, performance can be measured by line rate, quality of service , data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique, and modem enhancements.There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modeled instead of measured. For example, state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.  Network congestion  Network congestion occurs when a link or node is subjected to a greater data load than it is rated for, resulting in a deterioration of its quality of service. When networks are congested and queues become too full, packets have to be discarded, and so networks rely on re transmission. Typical effects of congestion include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either to only a small increase in the network throughput or to a reduction in network throughput. Network protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse. Modern networks use congestion control, congestion avoidance and traffic control techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse . These techniques include: exponential backoff in protocols such as 802.11's CSMA CA and the original Ethernet, window reduction in TCP, and fair queueing in devices such as routers. Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is 802.1p. A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention Free Transmission Opportunities in the ITU T G.hn standard, which provides high speed Local area networking over existing home wires . For the Internet, RFC 2914 addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.  Network resilience  Network resilience is the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation.  Security  Computer networks are also used by security hackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a denial of service attack.  Network security  Network Security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and its network accessible resources. Network security is the authorization of access to data in a network, which is controlled by the network administrator. Users are assigned an ID and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority. Network security is used on a variety of computer networks, both public and private, to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses, government agencies, and individuals.  Network surveillance  Network surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the Internet. The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency. Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity. Surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control, recognize and monitor threats, and prevent investigate criminal activity. With the advent of programs such as the Total Information Awareness program, technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software, and laws such as the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.However, many civil rights and privacy groups such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society, with limited political and personal freedoms. Fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as Hepting v. AT T. The hacktivist group Anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers draconian surveillance .  End to end encryption  End to end encryption is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End to end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as Internet providers or application service providers, from discovering or tampering with communications. End to end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity. Examples of end to end encryption include HTTPS for web traffic, PGP for email, OTR for instant messaging, ZRTP for telephony, and TETRA for radio. Typical server based communications systems do not include end to end encryption. These systems can only guarantee the protection of communications between clients and servers, not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non E2EE systems are Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger, Facebook, and Dropbox. Some such systems, for example, LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering end to end encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end to end encryption have turned out to contain a back door that subverts negotiation of the encryption key between the communicating parties, for example Skype or Hushmail. The end to end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the endpoints of the communication themselves, such as the technical exploitation of clients, poor quality random number generators, or key escrow. E2EE also does not address traffic analysis, which relates to things such as the identities of the endpoints and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.  SSL TLS  The introduction and rapid growth of e commerce on the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s made it obvious that some form of authentication and encryption was needed. Netscape took the first shot at a new standard. At the time, the dominant web browser was Netscape Navigator. Netscape created a standard called secure socket layer . SSL requires a server with a certificate. When a client requests access to an SSL secured server, the server sends a copy of the certificate to the client. The SSL client checks this certificate , and if the certificate checks out, the server is authenticated and the client negotiates a symmetric key cipher for use in the session. The session is now in a very secure encrypted tunnel between the SSL server and the SSL client.  Views of networks Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running. A community of interest has less of a connection of being in a local area and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via peer to peer technologies. Network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP IP architecture, subnets, map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using VLAN technology. Both users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP IP architectural terminology, an intranet is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users . Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An extranet is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet .Unofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by Internet Service Providers . From an engineering viewpoint, the Internet is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, that share the registered IP address space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the Border Gateway Protocol. Typically, the human readable names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the Domain Name System . Over the Internet, there can be business to business , business to consumer and consumer to consumer communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of communications security mechanism.

            "text": "A Crookes tube is an early experimental electrical discharge tube, with partial vacuum, invented by English physicist William Crookes and others around 1869 1875, in which cathode rays, streams of electrons, were discovered.Developed from the earlier Geissler tube, the Crookes tube consists of a partially evacuated glass bulb of various shapes, with two metal electrodes, the cathode and the anode, one at either end. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, cathode rays are projected in straight lines from the cathode. It was used by Crookes, Johann Hittorf, Julius Pl cker, Eugen Goldstein, Heinrich Hertz, Philipp Lenard, Kristian Birkeland and others to discover the properties of cathode rays, culminating in J.J. Thomson's 1897 identification of cathode rays as negatively charged particles, which were later named electrons. Crookes tubes are now used only for demonstrating cathode rays. Wilhelm R ntgen discovered X rays using the Crookes tube in 1895. The term Crookes tube is also used for the first generation, cold cathode X ray tubes, which evolved from the experimental Crookes tubes and were used until about 1920.  Operation  Crookes tubes are cold cathode tubes, meaning that they do not have a heated filament in them that releases electrons as the later electronic vacuum tubes usually do. Instead, electrons are generated by the ionization of the residual air by a high DC voltage applied between the cathode and anode electrodes in the tube, usually by an induction coil . The Crookes tubes require a small amount of air in them to function, from about 10 6 to 5 10 8 atmosphere . When high voltage is applied to the tube, the electric field accelerates the small number of electrically charged ions and free electrons always present in the gas, created by natural processes like photoionization and radioactivity. The electrons collide with other gas molecules, knocking electrons off them and creating more positive ions. The electrons go on to create more ions and electrons in a chain reaction called a Townsend discharge. All the positive ions are attracted to the cathode or negative electrode. When they strike it, they knock large numbers of electrons out of the surface of the metal, which in turn are repelled by the cathode and attracted to the anode or positive electrode. These are the cathode rays. Enough of the air has been removed from the tube that most of the electrons can travel the length of the tube without striking a gas molecule. The high voltage accelerates these low mass particles to a high velocity . When they get to the anode end of the tube, they have so much momentum that, although they are attracted to the anode, many fly past it and strike the end wall of the tube. When they strike atoms in the glass, they knock their orbital electrons into a higher energy level. When the electrons fall back to their original energy level, they emit light. This process, called cathodoluminescence, causes the glass to glow, usually yellow green. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the glow reveals where the beam of electrons strikes the glass. Later on, researchers painted the inside back wall of the tube with a phosphor, a fluorescent chemical such as zinc sulfide, in order to make the glow more visible. After striking the wall, the electrons eventually make their way to the anode, flow through the anode wire, the power supply, and back to the cathode. The above only describes the motion of the electrons. The full details of the action in a Crookes tube are complicated, because it contains a nonequilibrium plasma of positively charged ions, electrons, and neutral atoms which are constantly interacting. At higher gas pressures, above 10 6 atm , this creates a glow discharge; a pattern of different colored glowing regions in the gas, depending on the pressure in the tube . The details were not fully understood until the development of plasma physics in the early 20th century.  History Crookes tubes evolved from the earlier Geissler tubes invented by the German physicist and glassblower Heinrich Geissler in 1857, experimental tubes which are similar to modern neon tube lights. Geissler tubes had only a low vacuum, around 10 3 atm , and the electrons in them could only travel a short distance before hitting a gas molecule. So the current of electrons moved in a slow diffusion process, constantly colliding with gas molecules, never gaining much energy. These tubes did not create beams of cathode rays, only a colorful glow discharge that filled the tube as the electrons struck the gas molecules and excited them, producing light. By the 1870s, Crookes was able to evacuate his tubes to a lower pressure, 10 6 to 5x10 8 atm, using an improved Sprengel mercury vacuum pump invented by his coworker Charles A. Gimingham. He found that as he pumped more air out of his tubes, a dark area in the glowing gas formed next to the cathode. As the pressure got lower, the dark area, now called the Faraday dark space or Crookes dark space, spread down the tube, until the inside of the tube was totally dark. However, the glass envelope of the tube began to glow at the anode end.What was happening was that as more air was pumped out of the tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct the motion of the electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because Crookes tubes were operated at a higher voltage. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible. This accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube, such as the anode, cast a sharp edged shadow on the tube wall. Johann Hittorf was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow. In 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved that they came from the cathode, and named them cathode rays .At the time, atoms were the smallest particles known and were believed to be indivisible, the electron was unknown, and what carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last quarter of the 19th century, many ingenious types of Crookes tubes were invented and used in historic experiments to determine what cathode rays were . There were two theories: Crookes believed they were 'radiant matter'; that is, electrically charged atoms, while German scientists Hertz and Goldstein believed they were 'aether vibrations'; some new form of electromagnetic waves. The debate was resolved in 1897 when J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which was later named the electron. It was quickly realized that these particles were also responsible for electric currents in wires, and carried the negative charge in the atom. The colorful glowing tubes were also popular in public lectures to demonstrate the mysteries of the new science of electricity. Decorative tubes were made with fluorescent minerals, or butterfly figures painted with fluorescent paint, sealed inside. When power was applied, the fluorescent materials lit up with many glowing colors. In 1895, Wilhelm R ntgen discovered X rays emanating from Crookes tubes. The many uses for X rays were immediately apparent, the first practical application for Crookes tubes. Medical manufacturers began to produce specialized Crookes tubes to generate X rays, the first X ray tubes. Crookes tubes were unreliable and temperamental. Both the energy and the quantity of cathode rays produced depended on the pressure of residual gas in the tube. Over time the gas was absorbed by the walls of the tube, reducing the pressure. This reduced the amount of cathode rays produced and caused the voltage across the tube to increase, creating more energetic cathode rays. In Crookes X ray tubes this phenomenon was called hardening because the higher voltage produced harder , more penetrating X rays; a tube with a higher vacuum was called a hard tube, while one with lower vacuum was a soft tube. Eventually the pressure got so low the tube stopped working entirely. To prevent this, in heavily used tubes such as X ray tubes various softener devices were incorporated that released a small amount of gas, restoring the tube's function.The electronic vacuum tubes invented later around 1904 superseded the Crookes tube. These operate at a still lower pressure, around 10 9 atm , at which there are so few gas molecules that they do not conduct by ionization. Instead, they use a more reliable and controllable source of electrons, a heated filament or hot cathode which releases electrons by thermionic emission. The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized gas discharge tubes such as thyratrons. The technology of manipulating electron beams pioneered in Crookes tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, and particularly in the invention of the cathode ray tube by Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is now used in sophisticated processes such as electron beam lithography.  Discovery of X rays  When the voltage applied to a Crookes tube is high enough, around 5,000 volts or greater, it can accelerate the electrons to a high enough velocity to create X rays when they hit the anode or the glass wall of the tube. The fast electrons emit X rays when their path is bent sharply as they pass near the high electric charge of an atom's nucleus, a process called bremsstrahlung, or they knock an atom's inner electrons into a higher energy level, and these in turn emit X rays as they return to their former energy level, a process called X ray fluorescence. Many early Crookes tubes undoubtedly generated X rays, because early researchers such as Ivan Pulyui had noticed that they could make foggy marks on nearby unexposed photographic plates. On November 8, 1895, Wilhelm R ntgen was operating a Crookes tube covered with black cardboard when he noticed that a nearby fluorescent screen glowed faintly. He realized that some unknown invisible rays from the tube were able to pass through the cardboard and make the screen fluoresce. He found that they could pass through books and papers on his desk. R ntgen began to investigate the rays full time, and on December 28, 1895, published the first scientific research paper on X rays. R ntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discoveries. The many applications of X rays created the first practical use for Crookes tubes, and workshops began manufacturing specialized Crookes tubes to generate X rays, the first X ray tubes. The anode was made of a heavy metal, usually platinum, which generated more X rays, and was tilted at an angle to the cathode, so the X rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode had a concave spherical surface which focused the electrons into a small spot around 1 mm in diameter on the anode, in order to approximate a point source of X rays, which gave the sharpest radiographs. These cold cathode type X ray tubes were used until about 1920, when they were superseded by the hot cathode Coolidge X ray tube.  Experiments During the last quarter of the 19th century Crookes tubes were used in dozens of historic experiments to try to find out what cathode rays were. There were two theories: British scientists Crookes and Cromwell Varley believed they were particles of 'radiant matter', that is, electrically charged atoms. German researchers E. Wiedemann, Heinrich Hertz, and Eugen Goldstein believed they were 'aether vibrations', some new form of electromagnetic waves, and were separate from what carried the current through the tube. The debate continued until J.J. Thomson measured their mass, proving they were a previously unknown negatively charged particle, the first subatomic particle, which he called a 'corpuscle' but was later renamed the 'electron'.  Maltese cross  Julius Pl cker in 1869 built a tube with an anode shaped like a Maltese Cross facing the cathode. It was hinged, so it could fold down against the floor of the tube. When the tube was turned on, the cathode rays cast a sharp cross shaped shadow on the fluorescence on the back face of the tube, showing that the rays moved in straight lines. This fluorescence was used as an argument that cathode rays were electromagnetic waves, since the only thing known to cause fluorescence at the time was ultraviolet light. After a while the fluorescence would get 'tired' and the glow would decrease. If the cross was folded down out of the path of the rays, it no longer cast a shadow, and the previously shadowed area would fluoresce more strongly than the area around it.  Perpendicular emission  Eugen Goldstein in 1876 found that cathode rays were always emitted perpendicular to the cathode's surface. If the cathode was a flat plate, the rays were shot out in straight lines perpendicular to the plane of the plate. This was evidence that they were particles, because a luminous object, like a red hot metal plate, emits light in all directions, while a charged particle will be repelled by the cathode in a perpendicular direction. If the electrode was made in the form of a concave spherical dish, the cathode rays would be focused to a spot in front of the dish. This could be used to heat samples to a high temperature.  Deflection by electric fields  Heinrich Hertz built a tube with a second pair of metal plates to either side of the cathode ray beam, a crude CRT. If the cathode rays were charged particles, their path should be bent by the electric field created when a voltage was applied to the plates, causing the spot of light where the rays hit to move sideways. He did not find any bending, but it was later determined that his tube was insufficiently evacuated, causing accumulations of surface charge which masked the electric field. Later Arthur Shuster repeated the experiment with a higher vacuum. He found that the rays were attracted toward a positively charged plate and repelled by a negative one, bending the beam. This was evidence they were negatively charged, and therefore not electromagnetic waves.  Deflection by magnetic fields  Crookes put a magnet across the neck of the tube, so that the North pole was on one side of the beam and the South pole was on the other, and the beam travelled through the magnetic field between them. The beam was bent down, perpendicular to the magnetic field. To reveal the path of the beam, Crookes invented a tube with a cardboard screen with a phosphor coating down the length of the tube, at a slight angle so the electrons would strike the phosphor along its length, making a glowing line on the screen. The line could be seen to bend up or down in a transverse magnetic field. This effect was similar to the behavior of electric currents in an electric motor and showed that the cathode rays obeyed Faraday's law of induction like currents in wires. Both electric and magnetic deflection were evidence for the particle theory, because electric and magnetic fields have no effect on a beam of light waves.  Paddlewheel  Crookes put a tiny vaned turbine or paddlewheel in the path of the cathode rays, and found that it rotated when the rays hit it. The paddlewheel turned in a direction away from the cathode side of the tube, suggesting that the force of the cathode rays striking the paddles was causing the rotation. Crookes concluded at the time that this showed that cathode rays had momentum, so the rays were likely matter particles. However, later it was concluded that the paddle wheel turned not due to the momentum of the particles hitting the paddle wheel but due to the radiometric effect. When the rays hit the paddle surface they heated it, and the heat caused the gas next to it to expand, pushing the paddle. This was proven in 1903 by J. J. Thomson who calculated that the momentum of the electrons hitting the paddle wheel would only be sufficient to turn the wheel one revolution per minute. All this experiment really showed was that cathode rays were able to heat surfaces.  Charge  Jean Baptiste Perrin wanted to determine whether the cathode rays actually carried negative charge, or whether they just accompanied the charge carriers, as the Germans thought. In 1895 he constructed a tube with a 'catcher', a closed aluminum cylinder with a small hole in the end facing the cathode, to collect the cathode rays. The catcher was attached to an electroscope to measure its charge. The electroscope showed a negative charge, proving that cathode rays really carry negative electricity.  Anode rays  Goldstein found in 1886 that if the cathode is made with small holes in it, streams of a faint luminous glow will be seen issuing from the holes on the back side of the cathode, facing away from the anode. It was found that in an electric field these anode rays bend in the opposite direction from cathode rays, toward a negatively charged plate, indicating that they carry a positive charge. These were the positive ions which were attracted to the cathode, and created the cathode rays. They were named canal rays by Goldstein.  Doppler shift  Eugen Goldstein thought he had figured out a method of measuring the speed of cathode rays. If the glow discharge seen in the gas of Crookes tubes was produced by the moving cathode rays, the light radiated from them in the direction they were moving, down the tube, would be shifted in frequency due to the Doppler effect. This could be detected with a spectroscope because the emission line spectrum would be shifted. He built a tube shaped like an L , with a spectroscope pointed through the glass of the elbow down one of the arms. He measured the spectrum of the glow when the spectroscope was pointed toward the cathode end, then switched the power supply connections so the cathode became the anode and the electrons were moving in the other direction, and again observed the spectrum looking for a shift. He did not find one, which he calculated meant that the rays were traveling very slowly. It was later recognized that the glow in Crookes tubes is emitted from gas atoms hit by the electrons, not the electrons themselves. Since the atoms are thousands of times more massive than the electrons, they move much slower, accounting for the lack of Doppler shift.  Lenard window  Philipp Lenard wanted to see if cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. See diagram. He built a tube with a window in the glass envelope made of aluminum foil just thick enough to hold the atmospheric pressure out facing the cathode so the cathode rays would hit it. He found that something did come through. Holding a fluorescent screen up to the window caused it to fluoresce, even though no light reached it. A photographic plate held up to it would be darkened, even though it was not exposed to light. The effect had a very short range of about 2.5 centimetres . He measured the ability of cathode rays to penetrate sheets of material, and found they could penetrate much farther than moving atoms could. Since atoms were the smallest particles known at the time, this was first taken as evidence that cathode rays were waves. Later it was realized that electrons were much smaller than atoms, accounting for their greater penetration ability. Lenard was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905 for his work.

            "text": "The curie is a non SI unit of radioactivity originally defined in 1910. According to a notice in Nature at the time, it was to be named in honour of Pierre Curie, but was considered at least by some to be in honour of Marie Curie as well, and is in later literature considered to be named for both.It was originally defined as the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium , but is currently defined as 1 Ci 3.7 1010 decays per second after more accurate measurements of the activity of 226Ra . In 1975 the General Conference on Weights and Measures gave the becquerel , defined as one nuclear decay per second, official status as the SI unit of activity. Therefore: 1 Ci 3.7 1010 Bq 37 GBqand 1 Bq 2.703 10 11 Ci 27 pCiWhile its continued use is discouraged by National Institute of Standards and Technology and other bodies, the curie is still widely used throughout government, industry and medicine in the United States and in other countries. At the 1910 meeting, which originally defined the curie, it was proposed to make it equivalent to 10 nanograms of radium . But Marie Curie, after initially accepting this, changed her mind and insisted on one gram of radium. According to Bertram Boltwood, Marie Curie thought that the use of the name 'curie' for so infinitesimally small a quantity of anything was altogether inappropriate .The power emitted in radioactive decay corresponding to one curie can be calculated by multiplying the decay energy by approximately 5.93 mW MeV. A radiotherapy machine may have roughly 1000 Ci of a radioisotope such as caesium 137 or cobalt 60. This quantity of radioactivity can produce serious health effects with only a few minutes of close range, unshielded exposure. Radioactive decay can lead to the emission of particulate radiation or electromagnetic radiation. Ingesting even small quantities of some particulate emitting radionuclides may be fatal. For example, the median lethal dose for ingested polonium 210 is 240 Ci; about 53.5 nanograms. Although, millicurie quantities of electromagnetic emitting radionuclides are routinely used in Nuclear Medicine. The typical human body contains roughly 0.1 Ci of naturally occurring potassium 40. A human body containing 16 kg of carbon would also have about 24 nanograms or 0.1 Ci of carbon 14. Together, these would result in a total of approximately 0.2 Ci or 7400 decays per second inside the person's body .  As a measure of quantity Units of activity also refer to a quantity of radioactive atoms. Because the probability of decay is a fixed physical quantity, for a known number of atoms of a particular radionuclide, a predictable number will decay in a given time. The number of decays that will occur in one second in one gram of atoms of a particular radionuclide is known as the specific activity of that radionuclide. The activity of a sample decreases with time because of decay. The rules of radioactive decay may be used to convert activity to an actual number of atoms. They state that 1 Ci of radioactive atoms would follow the expression N   1 Ci 3.7 1010 Bq,and so N 3.7 1010 Bq ,where is the decay constant in s 1. We can also express activity in moles:                         1 Ci                                         3.7                  10             10                        B      q                 ln            2                  N             A                                        t          1                      2                                        8.8639              10                14                   moles                  t          1                      2                   in seconds                                   5.3183              10                12                   moles                  t          1                      2                   in minutes                                   3.1910              10                10                   moles                  t          1                      2                   in hours                                   7.6584              10                9                   moles                  t          1                      2                   in days                                   2.7972              10                6                   moles                  t          1                      2                   in years         ,                 displaystyle begin aligned text 1 Ci  frac mathrm 3.7 times 10 10 Bq  ln 2 ,N text A  times t 1 2  approx 8.8639 times 10 14 text moles times t 1 2 text in seconds  approx 5.3183 times 10 12 text moles times t 1 2 text in minutes  approx 3.1910 times 10 10 text moles times t 1 2 text in hours  approx 7.6584 times 10 9 text moles times t 1 2 text in days  approx 2.7972 times 10 6 text moles times t 1 2 text in years , end aligned  where NA is the Avogadro constant, and t1 2 is the half life.

            "text": "Czech , historically also Bohemian , is a West Slavic language of the Czech Slovak group, written in Latin script. Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of high mutual intelligibility, as well as to Polish to a lesser degree. Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German. The Czech Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid 19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main non standard variety, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak. Czech has a moderately sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants . Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is known to occur as a phoneme in only a few other languages, represented by the grapheme .  Classification  Czech is a member of the West Slavic sub branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo European language family. This branch includes Polish, Kashubian, Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak. Slovak is the most closely related language to Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.The West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more restricted distinction between hard and soft consonants .  History   Medieval Old Czech  The term Old Czech is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as early Old Czech , but the term Medieval Czech is also used. The function of the written language was initially performed by Old Slavonic written in Glagolitic, later by Latin written in Latin script. Around the 7th century, the Slavic expansion reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire. The West Slavic polity of Great Moravia formed by the 9th century. The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the Czech Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time, marked among other things by its use of the voiced velar fricative consonant and consistent stress on the first syllable.The Bohemian language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the late 13th and early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete Bible translation, the Leskovec Dresden Bible, also dates to this period. Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were also produced outside universities.Literary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation. Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography, advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.  Early Modern Czech  There was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century. In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on Western Slovak dialects.The publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries as it was used as a model for the standard language.In 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the Bohemian Revolt which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.  Modern Czech  The modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century. By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty. Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic l and  which survives in Slovak.With the beginning of the national revival of the mid 18th century, Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the Counter Reformation . Czech philologists studied sixteenth century texts, advocating the return of the language to high culture. This period is known as the Czech National Revival .During the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovsk released a German language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausf hrliches Lehrgeb ude der b hmischen Sprache . Dobrovsk had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovsk 's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival. Changes during this time included spelling reform , the use of t to end infinitive verbs and the non capitalization of nouns . These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak. Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.Adherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech , such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.  Geographic distribution  Czech is spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic. A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third highest proportion of a population in the European Union .As the official language of the Czech Republic , Czech is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia. Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Portugal , Poland and Germany .Czech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognized minority language in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.  United States  Immigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin. In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the commonest language spoken at home in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish , Czech was the most common home language in more than a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota. As of 2009, 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language .  Phonology   Vowels  Standard Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes, and three diphthongs. The vowels are a , , , o , and u , and their long counterparts a ,  , i , o and u . The diphthongs are ou , au and u ; the last two are found only in loanwords such as auto car and euro euro .In Czech orthography, the vowels are spelled as follows: Short: a, e , i y, o, u Long: , , , ,  Diphthongs: ou, au, euThe letter  indicates that the previous consonant is palatalised . After a labial it represents j ; but m is pronounced m , cf. m kk .  Consonants  The consonant phonemes of Czech and their equivalent letters in Czech orthography are as follows: Czech consonants are categorized as hard , neutral , or soft : Hard: d , , , k , n , r , t , x Neutral: b , f , l , m , p , s , v , z Soft: c , , j , , r , , t s , t , Hard consonants may not be followed by i or in writing, or soft ones by y or . Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as strong , and soft ones as weak . This distinction is also relevant to the declension patterns of nouns, which vary according to whether the final consonant of the noun stem is hard or soft.Voiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause, and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs, which matches voicing to the following consonant. The unvoiced counterpart of  is x .The phoneme represented by the letter  is very rare among languages and often claimed to be unique to Czech, though it also occurs in some dialects of Kashubian, and formerly occurred in Polish. It represents the raised alveolar non sonorant trill , a sound somewhere between Czech r and  , and is present in Dvo k. In unvoiced environments, r is realized as its voiceless allophone r , a sound somewhere between Czech r and .The consonants r , l , and m can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. Str prst skrz krk is a well known Czech tongue twister using syllabic consonants but no vowels.  Stress  Each word has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics . In all words of more than two syllables, every odd numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length; both long and short vowels can be stressed or unstressed. Vowels are never reduced in tone when unstressed. When a noun is preceded by a monosyllabic preposition, the stress usually moves to the preposition, e.g. do Prahy to Prague .  Grammar Czech grammar, like that of other Slavic languages, is fusional; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited. Czech inflects for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, mood, person and subject number and gender in verbs.Parts of speech include adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative words, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections. Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final or of the base form and replacing it with e, , y, or o. Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ne to the main verb of a clause, with one exception: je becomes nen .  Sentence and clause structure  Because Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence , its word order is flexible. As a pro drop language, in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb. Enclitics appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot can contain a subject or object, a main form of a verb, an adverb, or a conjunction .Czech syntax has a subject verb object sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used to distinguish topic and focus, with the topic or theme preceding the focus or rheme in a sentence; Czech has therefore been described as a topic prominent language. Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction , in colloquial style, word order changes frequently replace the passive voice. For example, to change Peter killed Paul to Paul was killed by Peter the order of subject and object is inverted: Petr zabil Pavla becomes Paul, Peter killed . Pavla is in the accusative case, the grammatical object of the verb.A word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question: Pes j bagetu. The dog eats the baguette . Bagetu j pes. The dog eats the baguette . Pes bagetu j . The dog eats the baguette . J pes bagetu? Does the dog eat the baguette? In parts of Bohemia , questions such as J pes bagetu? without an interrogative word are intoned in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.In modern Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns, with few exceptions. Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective kter , analogous to the English relative pronouns which , that and who whom . As with other adjectives, it agrees with its associated noun in gender, number and case. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify. The following is a glossed example:  Declension  In Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases which indicate their function in a sentence, two numbers and three genders . The masculine gender is further divided into animate and inanimate classes.  Case  A nominative accusative language, Czech marks subject nouns of transitive and intransitive verbs in the nominative case, which is the form found in dictionaries, and direct objects of transitive verbs are declined in the accusative case. The vocative case is used to address people. The remaining cases indicate semantic relationships, such as noun adjuncts , indirect objects , or agents in passive constructions . Additionally prepositions and some verbs require their complements to be declined in a certain case. The locative case is only used after prepositions. An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it modifies. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number: Some prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, od and z assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; na means onto or for with the accusative case, but on with the locative.This is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:  Gender  Czech distinguishes three genders masculine, feminine, and neuter and the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in a, e, or a consonant; neuter nouns in o, e, or , and masculine nouns in a consonant. Adjectives, participles, most pronouns, and the numbers one and two are marked for gender and agree with the gender of the noun they modify or refer to. Past tense verbs are also marked for gender, agreeing with the gender of the subject, e.g. d lal ; d lala and d lalo . Gender also plays a semantic role; most nouns that describe people and animals, including personal names, have separate masculine and feminine forms which are normally formed by adding a suffix to the stem, for example ech has the feminine form e ka .Nouns of different genders follow different declension patterns. Examples of declension patterns for noun phrases of various genders follow:  Number  Nouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five require subject and direct object noun phrases to be declined in the genitive plural instead of the nominative or accusative, and when used as subjects these phrases take singular verbs. For example: Numbers decline for case, and the numbers one and two are also inflected for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples. The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun ten. Although Czech's grammatical numbers are singular and plural, several residuals of dual forms remain, such as the words dva and oba , which decline the same way. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ruka ruce ; noha nohama , nohou ; oko o i, and ucho u i. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs. These forms are plural semantically, used for any non singular count, as in mezi ty ma o ima . The plural number paradigms of these nouns are a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, nohy is a standard plural form of this type of noun.  Verb conjugation  Czech verbs agree with their subjects in person , number , and in constructions involving participles, which includes the past tense, also in gender. They are conjugated for tense and mood . For example, the conjugated verb mluv me is in the present tense and first person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive mluvit by its ending, me. The infinitive form of Czech verbs ends in t . It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs .  Aspect  Typical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects: perfective and imperfective. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs for example, koupit and kupovat . Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing or repeated. This is distinct from past and present tense. Any verb of either aspect can be conjugated into either the past or present tense, but the future tense is only used with imperfective verbs. Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.The verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix for example, the imperfective ps t compared with the perfective napsat . The most common prefixes are na , o , po , s , u , vy , z and za . In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit and prodat have the imperfective forms kupovat and prod vat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs , denoting repeated or regular action. The verb j t has the iterative form chodit and the frequentative form chod vat .Many verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of being b t , cht t , moct , le et have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of change for example, ot hotn t and nadchnout se have no imperfective aspect.  Tense  The present tense in Czech is formed by adding an ending which agrees with the person and number of the subject at the end of the verb stem. As Czech is a null subject language, the subject pronoun can be omitted unless it is needed for clarity. The past tense is formed using a participle which ends in l and a further ending which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. For the first and second persons, the auxiliary verb b t conjugated in the present tense is added.In some contexts, the present tense of perfective verbs implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action. The perfective present is used to refer to completion of actions in the future and is distinguished from the imperfective future tense, which refers to actions that will be ongoing in the future. The future tense is regularly formed using the future conjugation of b t and the infinitive of an imperfective verb, for example, budu j st I will eat or I will be eating . Where budu has a noun or adjective complement it means I will be , for example, budu astn . Some verbs of movement form their future tense by adding the prefix po to the present tense forms instead, e.g. jedu  pojedu .  Mood  Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional. The imperative mood is formed by adding specific endings for each of three person number categories:  i ej for second person singular, te ete ejte for second person plural and me eme ejme for first person plural. Imperatives are usually expressed using perfective verbs if positive and imperfective verbs if negative. The conditional mood is formed with a conditional auxiliary verb after the participle ending in l which is used to form the past tense. This mood indicates hypothetical events and can also be used to express wishes.  Verb classes  Most Czech verbs fall into one of five classes, which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of b t would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:  Orthography  Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its alphabet contains 42 graphemes, most of which correspond to individual phonemes, and only contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words. The h ek is used with certain letters to form new characters: , , and , as well as , , , , and . The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above because of their height. Czech orthography has influenced the orthographies of other Balto Slavic languages and some of its characters have been adopted for transliteration of Cyrillic.Czech orthography neatly reflects vowel length; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or, occasionally with , a ring. Long u is usually written at the beginning of a word or morpheme and elsewhere, except for loanwords or onomatopoeia . Long vowels and are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order. The character exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.Czech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most European languages that use the Latin script, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Ordinal numbers use a point, as in German . The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three digits, including those in decimal places, may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts. The number 1,234,567.89101 may be written as 1234567,89101 or 1 234 567,891 01. In proper noun phrases , only the first word is capitalized .  Varieties  The modern literary standard and prestige variety, known as Standard Czech is based on the standardization during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s, significantly influenced by Josef Jungmann's Czech German dictionary published during 1834 1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms. Standard Czech is the formal register of the language which is used in official documents, formal literature, newspaper articles, education and occasionally public speeches. It is codified by the Czech Language Institute, who publish occasional reforms to the codification. The most recent reform took place in 1993. The term hovorov e tina is sometimes used to refer to the spoken variety of standard Czech.The most widely spoken vernacular form of the language is called Common Czech , an interdialect influenced by spoken Standard Czech and the Central Bohemian dialects of the Prague region. Other Bohemian regional dialects have become marginalized, while Moravian dialects remain more widespread and diverse, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s. These varieties of the language form a stylistic continuum, in which contact between varieties of a similar prestige influences change within them.  Common Czech  The main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily in Bohemia including the capital Prague, is known as Common Czech . This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with deformed or incorrect Czech. Compared to Standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.Common Czech is distinguished from spoken colloquial Standard Czech , which is a stylistic variety within standard Czech. Tomasz Kamusella defines the spoken variety of Standard Czech as a compromise between Common Czech and the written standard, while Miroslav Kom rek calls Common Czech an intersection of spoken Standard Czech and regional dialects.Common Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia . Common Czech is not codified, but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. Since the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence. Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media. The colloquial form of Standard Czech finds limited use in daily communication due to the expansion of the Common Czech interdialect. It is sometimes defined as a theoretical construct rather than an actual tool of colloquial communication, since in casual contexts, the non standard interdialect is preferred.Common Czech phonology is based on that of the Central Bohemian dialect group, which has a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to Standard Czech. The phoneme  is peripheral and usually merges with i , e.g. in mal m sto , plam nek and l tat , and a second native diphthong  occurs, usually in places where Standard Czech has i , e.g. malej d m , mlejn , plejtvat , bejt . In addition, a prothetic v is added to most words beginning o , such as votev t vokno .Non standard morphological features that are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers include: unified plural endings of adjectives: mal lidi , mal eny , mal m sta  standard: mal lid , mal eny, mal m sta; unified instrumental ending ma in plural: s t ma dobrejma lidma, enama, chlapama, m stama  standard: s t mi dobr mi lidmi, enami, chlapy, m sty. In essence, this form resembles the form of the dual, which was once a productive form, but now is almost extinct and retained in a lexically specific set of words. In Common Czech the ending became productive again around the 17th century, but used as a substitute for a regular plural form. omission of the syllabic l in the masculine ending of past tense verbs: ek , moh , p ch  standard: ekl, mohl, p chl. tendency of merging the locative singular masculine neuter for adjectives with the instrumental by changing the locative ending m to m and then shortening the vowel: mlad m , mlad m  mlad m , mladym  mladym .Examples of declension : mlad lov k young man person, mlad lid young people, mlad st t young state, mlad ena young woman, mlad zv e young animal  Bohemian dialects  Apart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to Standard Czech.The Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects: N e st edo esk N e jihoz pado esk Podskupina chodsk Podskupina doudlebsk N e severov chodo esk Podskupina podkrkno sk   Moravian dialects  The Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian . In the Austro Hungarian Empire, Bohemian Moravian Slovak was a language citizens could register as speaking . In the 2011 census, where respondents could optionally specify up to two first languages, 62,908 Czech citizens specified Moravian as their first language and 45,561 specified both Moravian and Czech.Beginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak; the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages, using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.The Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects: N e eskomoravsk N e st edomoravsk Podskupina ti novsk N e v chodomoravsk Podskupina slov ck Podskupina vala sk N e slezsk   Sample  In a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology, B etislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects:  Mutual intelligibility with Slovak  Czech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Following the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, mutual intelligibility declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers began to experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa. A 2015 study involving participants with a mean age of around 23 nonetheless concluded that there remained a high degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages. Grammatically, both languages share a common syntax.One study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation; Slovak morphology is more regular . The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.The similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th century scholars who called themselves Czechoslavs , believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and Hungarians and other Slavs. During the First Czechoslovak Republic , although Czechoslovak was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State , literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own ; during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from Czech, due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Czechoslovak has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.  Vocabulary  Czech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo European roots. Although most verbs have Balto Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo European roots. Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words .Most Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German, Greek and Latin, arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French, and also from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.Although older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture. During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; music is muzyka in Polish and   in Russian, but in Czech it is hudba. Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languages for example, robot and polka .  Example text Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Czech: V ichni lid rod se svobodn a sob rovn co do d stojnosti a pr v. Jsou nad ni rozumem a sv dom m a maj spolu jednat v duchu bratrstv .Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

            "text": "Czechoslovakia, or Czecho Slovakia , was a sovereign state in Central Europe, created in October 1918, when it declared its independence from Austria Hungary. In 1938, after the Munich Agreement, the Sudetenland became part of Germany, while the country lost further territories to Hungary and Poland. Between 1939 and 1945 the state ceased to exist, as Slovakia proclaimed its independence and subsequently the remaining territories in the east became part of Hungary, while in the remainder of the Czech Lands the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed. In October 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, former Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene formed a government in exile and sought recognition from the Allies. After World War II, the pre 1938 Czechoslovakia was reestablished, with the exception of Carpathian Ruthenia, which became part of the Ukrainian SSR . From 1948 to 1989, Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc with a command economy. Its economic status was formalized in membership of Comecon from 1949 and its defense status in the Warsaw Pact of 1955. A period of political liberalization in 1968, known as the Prague Spring, was violently ended when the Soviet Union, assisted by some other Warsaw Pact countries, invaded Czechoslovakia. In 1989, as Marxist Leninist governments and communism were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe, Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their socialist government on 17 November 1989 in the Velvet Revolution. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia as the result of national tensions of the Slovaks.  Characteristics Form of state1918 1938: A democratic republic championed by Tom Masaryk. 1938 1939: After the acquisition of Sudetenland by Nazi Germany in 1938, the region gradually turned into a state with loosened connections among the Czech, Slovak, and Ruthenian parts. A strip of southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia was redeemed by Hungary, and the Zaolzie region was annexed by Poland. 1939 1945: The remainder of the state was dismembered and became split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Slovak Republic, while the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied and annexed by Hungary. A government in exile continued to exist in London, supported by the United Kingdom, United States and their Allies; after the German invasion of Soviet Union, it was also recognized by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia adhered to the Declaration by United Nations and was a founding member of the United Nations. 1946 1948: The country was governed by a coalition government with communist ministers, including the prime minister and the minister of interior. Carpathian Ruthenia was ceded to the Soviet Union. 1948 1989: The country became a Marxist Leninist state under Soviet domination with a command economy. In 1960, the country officially became a socialist republic, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. It was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. 1989 1990: Czechoslovakia formally became a federal republic comprising the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic. In late 1989, the communist rule came to an end during the Velvet Revolution followed by the re establishment of a democratic parliamentary republic. 1990 1992: Shortly after the Velvet Revolution, the state was renamed the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, consisting of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic until the peaceful dissolution on 31 December 1992.NeighborsAustria 1918 1938, 1945 1992 Germany Hungary Poland Romania 1918 1938 Soviet Union 1945 1991 Ukraine 1991 1992 TopographyThe country was of generally irregular terrain. The western area was part of the north central European uplands. The eastern region was composed of the northern reaches of the Carpathian Mountains and lands of the Danube River basin. ClimateThe weather is mild winters and mild summers. Influenced by the Atlantic Ocean from the west, the Baltic Sea from the north, and Mediterranean Sea from the south. There is no continental weather.  Names  1918 1938: Czechoslovak Republic , or Czechoslovakia, before the formalization of the name in 1920, also known as Czecho Slovakia or the Czecho Slovak state 1938 1939: Czecho Slovak Republic, or Czecho Slovakia 1945 1960: Czechoslovak Republic , or Czechoslovakia 1960 1989: Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , or Czechoslovakia 1990 1992: Czech and Slovak Federative Republic , or Czechoslovakia  History   Origins  The area was long a part of the Austro Hungarian Empire until the empire collapsed at the end of World War I. The new state was founded by Tom Garrigue Masaryk , who served as its first president from 14 November 1918 to 14 December 1935. He was succeeded by his close ally, Edvard Bene . The roots of Czech nationalism go back to the 19th century, when philologists and educators, influenced by Romanticism, promoted the Czech language and pride in the Czech people. Nationalism became a mass movement in the second half of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as historian Franti ek Palack founded various patriotic, self help organizations which provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life prior to independence. Palack supported Austro Slavism and worked for a reorganized and federal Austrian Empire, which would protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats. An advocate of democratic reform and Czech autonomy within Austria Hungary, Masaryk was elected twice to the Reichsrat , first from 1891 to 1893 for the Young Czech Party, and again from 1907 to 1914 for the Czech Realist Party, which he had founded in 1889 with Karel Kram and Josef Kaizl. During World War I a number of Czechs and Slovaks, the Czechoslovak Legions, fought with the Allies in France and Italy, while large numbers deserted to Russia in exchange for its support for the independence of Czechoslovakia from the Austrian Empire. With the outbreak of World War I, Masaryk began working for Czech independence in a union with Slovakia. With Edvard Bene and Milan Rastislav tef nik, Masaryk visited several Western countries and won support from influential publicists. The Czechoslovak National Council was the main organization that advanced the claims for a Czechoslovak state.  First Czechoslovak Republic   Formation  The Bohemian Kingdom ceased to exist in 1918 when it was incorporated into Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was founded in October 1918, as one of the successor states of the Austro Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I and as part of the Treaty of Saint Germain en Laye. It consisted of the present day territories of Bohemia, Moravia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Its territory included some of the most industrialized regions of the former Austria Hungary.  Ethnicity  The new country was a multi ethnic state, with Czechs and Slovaks as constituent peoples. The population consisted of Czechs , Slovaks , Germans , Hungarians and Rusyns . Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups. This policy led to unrest among the non Czech population, particularly in German speaking Sudetenland, which initially had proclaimed itself part of the Republic of German Austria in accordance with the self determination principle. The state proclaimed the official ideology that there were no separate Czech and Slovak nations, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks , to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II , the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again. The governments of Czechoslovakia and other Central European nations deported ethnic Germans, reducing the presence of minorities in the nation. Most of the Jews had been killed during the war by the Nazis. Jews identified themselves as Germans or Hungarians , the sum is, therefore, more than 100 .  Interwar period  During the period between the two world wars Czechoslovakia was a democratic state. The population was generally literate, and contained fewer alienated groups. The influence of these conditions was augmented by the political values of Czechoslovakia's leaders and the policies they adopted. Under Tomas Masaryk, Czech and Slovak politicians promoted progressive social and economic conditions that served to defuse discontent. Foreign minister Bene became the prime architect of the Czechoslovak Romanian Yugoslav alliance directed against Hungarian attempts to reclaim lost areas. Bene worked closely with France. Far more dangerous was the German element, which after 1933 became allied with the Nazis in Germany. The increasing feeling of inferiority among the Slovaks, who were hostile to the more numerous Czechs, weakened the country in the late 1930s. Many Slovaks supported an extreme nationalist movement and welcomed the puppet Slovak state set up under Hitler's control in 1939.After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy in central and eastern Europe.  Munich Agreement, and Two Step German Occupation  In September 1938, Adolf Hitler demanded control of the Sudetenland. On 29 September 1938, Britain and France ceded control in the Appeasement at the Munich Conference; France ignored the military alliance it had with Czechoslovakia. During October 1938, Nazi Germany occupied the Sudetenland border region, effectively crippling Czechoslovak defences. The First Vienna Award assigned a strip of southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia to Hungary. Poland occupied Zaolzie, an area whose population was majority Polish, in October 1938. On 14 March 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was dismembered by the proclamation of the Slovak State, the next day the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied and annexed by Hungary, while the following day the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed. The eventual goal of the German state under Nazi leadership was to eradicate Czech nationality through assimilation, deportation, and extermination of the Czech intelligentsia; the intellectual elites and middle class made up a considerable number of the 200,000 people who passed through concentration camps and the 250,000 who died during German occupation. Under Generalplan Ost, it was assumed that around 50 of Czechs would be fit for Germanization. The Czech intellectual elites were to be removed not only from Czech territories but from Europe completely. The authors of Generalplan Ost believed it would be best if they emigrated overseas, as even in Siberia they were considered a threat to German rule. Just like Jews, Poles, Serbs, and several other nations, Czechs were considered to be untermenschen by the Nazi state. In 1940, in a secret Nazi plan for the Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia it was declared that those considered to be of racially Mongoloid origin and the Czech intelligentsia were not to be Germanized.The deportation of Jews to concentration camps was organized under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, and the fortress town of Terez n was made into a ghetto way station for Jewish families. On 4 June 1942 Heydrich died after being wounded by an assassin in Operation Anthropoid. Heydrich's successor, Colonel General Kurt Daluege, ordered mass arrests and executions and the destruction of the villages of Lidice and Le ky. In 1943 the German war effort was accelerated. Under the authority of Karl Hermann Frank, German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, some 350,000 Czech laborers were dispatched to the Reich. Within the protectorate, all non war related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quiescently up until the final months preceding the end of the war, while thousands were involved in the resistance movement. For the Czechs of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, German occupation was a period of brutal oppression. Czech losses resulting from political persecution and deaths in concentration camps totaled between 36,000 and 55,000. The Jewish populations of Bohemia and Moravia were virtually annihilated. Many Jews emigrated after 1939; more than 70,000 were killed; 8,000 survived at Terez n. Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation. Despite the estimated 136,000 deaths at the hands of the Nazi regime, the population in the Reichsprotektorate saw a net increase during the war years of approximately 250,000 in line with an increased birth rate.On 6 May 1945, the third US Army of General Patton entered Pilsen from the south west. On 9 May 1945, Soviet Red Army troops entered Prague.  Communist Czechoslovakia  After World War II, pre war Czechoslovakia was re established, with the exception of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union and incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Bene decrees were promulgated concerning ethnic Germans and ethnic Hungarians. Under the decrees, citizenship was abrogated for people of German and Hungarian ethnic origin who had accepted German or Hungarian citizenship during the occupations. In 1948, this provision was cancelled for the Hungarians, but only partially for the Germans. The government then confiscated the property of the Germans and expelled about 90 of the ethnic German population, over 2 million people. Those who remained were collectively accused of supporting the Nazis after the Munich Agreement, as 97.32 of Sudeten Germans had voted for the NSDAP in the December 1938 elections. Almost every decree explicitly stated that the sanctions did not apply to antifascists. Some 250,000 Germans, many married to Czechs, some antifascists, and also those required for the post war reconstruction of the country, remained in Czechoslovakia. The Bene Decrees still cause controversy among nationalist groups in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary.Following the expulsion of the ethnic German population from Czechoslovakia, parts of the former Sudetenland, especially around Krnov and the surrounding villages of the Jesenik mountain region in northeastern Czechoslovakia, were settled in 1949 by Communist refugees from Northern Greece who had left their homeland as a result of the Greek Civil War. These Greeks made up a large proportion of the town and region's population until the late 1980s early 1990s. Although defined as Greeks , the Greek Communist community of Krnov and the Jeseniky region actually consisted of an ethnically diverse population, including Greek Macedonians, Slavo Macedonians, Vlachs, Pontic Greeks and Turkish speaking Urums or Caucasus Greeks. Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied by the Soviet Union. In the 1946 parliamentary election, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was the winner in the Czech lands, and the Democratic Party won in Slovakia. In February 1948 the Communists seized power. Although they would maintain the fiction of political pluralism through the existence of the National Front, except for a short period in the late 1960s the country had no liberal democracy. Since citizens lacked significant electoral methods of registering protest against government policies, periodically there were street protests that became violent. For example, there were riots in the town of Plze in 1953, reflecting economic discontent. Police and army units put down the rebellion, and hundreds were injured but no one was killed. While its economy remained more advanced than those of its neighbors in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia grew increasingly economically weak relative to Western Europe.The currency reform of 1953 caused dissatisfaction among Czechoslovak laborers. To equalize the wage rate, Czechoslovaks had to turn in their old money for new at a decreased value. The banks also confiscated savings and bank deposits to control the amount of money in circulation. In the 1950s, Czechoslovakia experienced high economic growth , which allowed for a substantial increase in wages and living standards, thus promoting the stability of the regime. In 1968, when the reformer Alexander Dub ek was appointed to the key post of First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, there was a brief period of liberalization known as the Prague Spring. In response, after failing to persuade the Czechoslovak leaders to change course, five other members of the Warsaw Pact invaded. Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia on the night of 20 21 August 1968. Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev viewed this intervention as vital for the preservation of the Soviet, socialist system and vowed to intervene in any state that sought to replace Marxism Leninism with capitalism.In the week after the invasion there was a spontaneous campaign of civil resistance against the occupation. This resistance involved a wide range of acts of non cooperation and defiance: this was followed by a period in which the Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership, having been forced in Moscow to make concessions to the Soviet Union, gradually put the brakes on their earlier liberal policies.Meanwhile, one plank of the reform program had been carried out: in 1968 69, Czechoslovakia was turned into a federation of the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic. The theory was that under the federation, social and economic inequities between the Czech and Slovak halves of the state would be largely eliminated. A number of ministries, such as education, now became two formally equal bodies in the two formally equal republics. However, the centralized political control by the Czechoslovak Communist Party severely limited the effects of federalization. The 1970s saw the rise of the dissident movement in Czechoslovakia, represented among others by V clav Havel. The movement sought greater political participation and expression in the face of official disapproval, manifested in limitations on work activities, which went as far as a ban on professional employment, the refusal of higher education for the dissidents' children, police harassment and prison.  After 1989  In 1989, the Velvet Revolution restored democracy. This occurred at around the same time as the fall of communism in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and Poland. The word socialist was removed from the country's full name on 29 March 1990 and replaced by federal . Pope John Paul II made a papal visit to Czechoslovakia on 21 April 1990, hailing it as a symbolic step of reviving Christianity in the newly formed post communist state. Czechoslovakia participated in the Gulf War with a small force of 200 troops under the command of the U.S. led coalition. In 1992, because of growing nationalist tensions in the government, Czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved by parliament. On 31 December 1992 it formally separated into two independent countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.  Government and politics  After World War II, a political monopoly was held by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia . The leader of the KS was de facto the most powerful person in the country during this period. Gust v Hus k was elected first secretary of the KS in 1969 and president of Czechoslovakia in 1975. Other parties and organizations existed but functioned in subordinate roles to the KS . All political parties, as well as numerous mass organizations, were grouped under umbrella of the National Front. Human rights activists and religious activists were severely repressed.  Constitutional development  Czechoslovakia had the following constitutions during its history : Temporary constitution of 14 November 1918 : see History of Czechoslovakia The 1920 constitution , democratic, in force until 1948, several amendments The Communist 1948 Ninth of May Constitution The Communist 1960 Constitution of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic with major amendments in 1968 , 1971, 1975, 1978, and 1989 . It was amended several more times during 1990 1992   Heads of state and government  List of presidents of Czechoslovakia List of prime ministers of Czechoslovakia  Foreign policy   International agreements and membership  In the 1930s, the nation formed a military alliance with France, which collapsed in the Munich Agreement of 1938. After World War II, an active participant in Council for Mutual Economic Assistance , Warsaw Pact, United Nations and its specialized agencies; signatory of conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Administrative divisions  1918 1923: Different systems in former Austrian territory compared to former Hungarian territory : three lands  : Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, plus 21 counties in today's Slovakia and three counties in today's Ruthenia; both lands and counties were divided into districts . 1923 1927: As above, except that the Slovak and Ruthenian counties were replaced by six counties upy in Slovakia and one county in Ruthenia, and the numbers and boundaries of the okresy were changed in those two territories. 1928 1938: Four lands : Bohemia, Moravia Silesia, Slovakia and Sub Carpathian Ruthenia, divided into districts . Late 1938 March 1939: As above, but Slovakia and Ruthenia gained the status of autonomous lands . Slovakia was called Slovensk t t, with its own currency and government. 1945 1948: As in 1928 1938, except that Ruthenia became part of the Soviet Union. 1949 1960: 19 regions divided into 270 okresy. 1960 1992: 10 kraje, Prague, and Bratislava ; these were divided into 109 114 okresy; the kraje were abolished temporarily in Slovakia in 1969 1970 and for many purposes from 1991 in Czechoslovakia; in addition, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic were established in 1969 .  Population and ethnic groups   Economy  Before World War II, the economy was about the fourth in all industrial countries in Europe. The state was based on strong economy, manufacturing cars , trams, aircraft , ships, ship engines , cannons, shoes , turbines, guns . It was the industrial workshop for the Austro Hungarian empire. The Slovak lands relied more heavily on agriculture than the Czech lands. After World War II, the economy was centrally planned, with command links controlled by the communist party, similarly to the Soviet Union. The large metallurgical industry was dependent on imports of iron and non ferrous ores. Industry: Extractive industry and manufacturing dominated the sector, including machinery, chemicals, food processing, metallurgy, and textiles. The sector was wasteful in its use of energy, materials, and labor and was slow to upgrade technology, but the country was a major supplier of high quality machinery, instruments, electronics, aircraft, airplane engines and arms to other socialist countries. Agriculture: Agriculture was a minor sector, but collectivized farms of large acreage and relatively efficient mode of production enabled the country to be relatively self sufficient in the food supply. The country depended on imports of grains in years of adverse weather. Meat production was constrained by a shortage of feed, but the country still recorded high per capita consumption of meat. Foreign Trade: Exports were estimated at US 17.8 billion in 1985. Exports were machinery , fuel and materials , and manufactured consumer goods . Imports stood at an estimated US 17.9 billion in 1985, including fuel and materials , machinery , and agricultural and forestry products . In 1986, about 80 of foreign trade was with other socialist countries. Exchange rate: Official, or commercial, the rate was crowns 5.4 per US 1 in 1987. Tourist, or non commercial, the rate was K s 10.5 per US 1. Neither rate reflected purchasing power. The exchange rate on the black market was around K s 30 per US 1, which became the official rate once the currency became convertible in the early 1990s. Fiscal year: Calendar year. Fiscal policy: The state was the exclusive owner of means of production in most cases. Revenue from state enterprises was the primary source of revenues followed by turnover tax. The government spent heavily on social programs, subsidies, and investment. The budget was usually balanced or left a small surplus.  Resource base  After World War II, the country was short of energy, relying on imported crude oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union, domestic brown coal, and nuclear and hydroelectric energy. Energy constraints were a major factor in the 1980s.  Transport and communications  Slightly after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, there was a lack of essential infrastructure in many areas paved roads, railways, bridges, etc. Massive improvement in the following years enabled Czechoslovakia to develop its industry. Prague's civil airport in Ruzyn became one of the most modern terminals in the world when it was finished in 1937. Tom Ba a, a Czech entrepreneur and visionary, outlined his ideas in the publication Budujme st t pro 40 milion lid , where he described the future motorway system. Construction of the first motorways in Czechoslovakia begun in 1939, nevertheless, they were stopped after German occupation during World War II.  Society   Education  Education was free at all levels and compulsory from ages 6 to 15. The vast majority of the population was literate. There was a highly developed system of apprenticeship training and vocational schools supplemented general secondary schools and institutions of higher education.  Religion  In 1991, 46 of the population were Roman Catholics, 5.3 were Evangelical Lutheran, 30 were Atheist, and other religions made up 17 of the country, but there were huge differences in religious practices between the two constituent republics; see Czech Republic and Slovakia.  Health, social welfare and housing  After World War II, free health care was available to all citizens. National health planning emphasized preventive medicine; factory and local health care centres supplemented hospitals and other inpatient institutions. There was a substantial improvement in rural health care during the 1960s and 1970s.  Mass media  During the era between the World Wars, Czechoslovak democracy and liberalism facilitated conditions for free publication. The most significant daily newspapers in these times were Lidov noviny, N rodn listy, esk den k and eskoslovensk Republika. During Communist rule, the mass media in Czechoslovakia were controlled by the Communist Party. Private ownership of any publication or agency of the mass media was generally forbidden, although churches and other organizations published small periodicals and newspapers. Even with this information monopoly in the hands of organizations under KS control, all publications were reviewed by the government's Office for Press and Information.  Sports  The Czechoslovakia national football team was a consistent performer on the international scene, with eight appearances in the FIFA World Cup Finals, finishing in second place in 1934 and 1962. The team also won the European Football Championship in 1976, came in third in 1980 and won the Olympic gold in 1980. Well known football players such as Pavel Nedv d, Anton n Panenka, Milan Baro , Tom Rosick , Vladim r micer or Petr ech were all born in Czechoslovakia. The International Olympic Committee code for Czechoslovakia is TCH, which is still used in historical listings of results. The Czechoslovak national ice hockey team won many medals from the world championships and Olympic Games. Peter astn , Jarom r J gr, Dominik Ha ek, Peter Bondra, Petr Kl ma, Mari n G bor k, Mari n Hossa, Miroslav atan and Pavol Demitra all come from Czechoslovakia. Emil Z topek, winner of four Olympic gold medals in athletics, is considered one of the top athletes in Czechoslovak history. V ra slavsk was an Olympic gold medallist in gymnastics, winning seven gold medals and four silver medals. She represented Czechoslovakia in three consecutive Olympics. Several accomplished professional tennis players including Jaroslav Drobn , Ivan Lendl, Jan Kode , Miloslav Me , Hana Mandl kov , Martina Hingis, Martina Navratilova, Jana Novotna, Petra Kvitov and Daniela Hantuchov were born in Czechoslovakia.

            "text": "The dalton or unified atomic mass unit is a unit of mass widely used in physics and chemistry. It is defined as 1 12 of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon 12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest. The atomic mass constant, denoted mu, is defined identically, giving mu m 12 1 Da.This unit is commonly used in physics and chemistry to express the mass of atomic scale objects, such as atoms, molecules, and elementary particles, both for discrete instances and multiple types of ensemble averages. For example, an atom of helium 4 has a mass of 4.0026 Da. This is an intrinsic property of the isotope and all helium 4 atoms have the same mass. Acetylsalicylic acid , C9H8O4, has an average mass of approximately 180.157 Da. However, there are no acetylsalicylic acid molecules with this mass. The two most common masses of individual acetylsalicylic acid molecules are 180.0423 Da, having the most common isotopes, and 181.0456 Da, in which one carbon is carbon 13. The molecular masses of proteins, nucleic acids, and other large polymers are often expressed with the units kilodaltons , megadaltons , etc. Titin, one of the largest known proteins, has a molecular mass of between 3 and 3.7 megadaltons. The DNA of chromosome 1 in the human genome has about 249 million base pairs, each with an average mass of about 650 Da, or 156 GDa total.The mole is a unit of amount of substance, widely used in chemistry and physics, which was originally defined so that the mass of one mole of a substance, measured in grams, would be numerically equal to the average mass of one of its constituent particles, measured in daltons. That is, the molar mass of a chemical compound was meant to be numerically equal to its average molecular mass. For example, the average mass of one molecule of water is about 18.0153 daltons, and one mole of water is about 18.0153 grams. A protein whose molecule has an average mass of 64 kDa would have a molar mass of 64 kg mol. However, while this equality can be assumed for almost all practical purposes, it is now only approximate, because of the way mole was redefined on 20 May 2019.In general, the mass in daltons of an atom is numerically close but not exactly equal to the number of nucleons A contained in its nucleus. It follows that the molar mass of a compound is numerically close to the average number of nucleons contained in each molecule. By definition, the mass of an atom of carbon 12 is 12 daltons, which corresponds with the number of nucleons that it has . However, the mass of an atomic scale object is affected by the binding energy of the nucleons in its atomic nuclei, as well as the mass and binding energy of its electrons. Therefore, this equality holds only for the carbon 12 atom in the stated conditions, and will vary for other substances. For example, the mass of one unbound atom of the common hydrogen isotope is 1.007825032241 Da, the mass of the proton is 1.007276466621 Da,, the mass of one free neutron is 1.00866491595 Da, and the mass of one hydrogen 2 atom is 2.014101778114 Da. In general, the difference is less than 0.1 ; exceptions include hydrogen 1 , helium 3 , lithium 6 and beryllium . The dalton differs from the unit of mass in the atomic units systems, which is the electron rest mass .  Energy equivalents The atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its energy equivalent, muc2. The 2018 CODATA recommended values are: The megaelectronvolt mass equivalent is commonly used as a unit of mass in particle physics, and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses.  History   Origin of the concept  The interpretation of the law of definite proportions in terms of the atomic theory of matter implied that the masses of atoms of various elements had definite ratios that depended on the elements. While the actual masses were unknown, the relative masses could be deduced from that law. In 1803 John Dalton proposed to use the atomic mass of the lightest atom, that of hydrogen, as the natural unit of atomic mass. This was the basis of the atomic weight scale.For technical reasons, in 1898, chemist Wilhelm Ostwald and others proposed to redefine the unit of atomic mass as 1 16 of the mass of an oxygen atom. That proposal was formally adopted by the International Committee on Atomic Weights in 1903. That was approximately the mass of one hydrogen atom, but oxygen was more amenable to experimental determination. This suggestion was made before the discovery of the existence of elemental isotopes, which occurred in 1912. The physicist Jean Perrin had adopted the same definition in 1909 during his experiments to determine the atomic masses and the Avogadro constant. This definition remained unchanged until 1961. Perrin also defined the mole as an amount of a compound that contained as many molecules as 32 grams of oxygen . He called that number the Avogadro number in honor of physicist Amedeo Avogadro.  Isotopic variation  The discovery of isotopes of oxygen in 1929 required a more precise definition of the unit. Unfortunately, two distinct definitions came into use. Chemists choose to define the AMU as 1 16 of the average mass of an oxygen atom as found in nature; that is, the average of the masses of the known isotopes, weighted by their natural abundance. Physicists, on the other hand, defined it as 1 16 of the mass of an atom of the isotope oxygen 16 .  Definition by the IUPAC  The existence of two distinct units with the same name was confusing, and the difference was large enough to affect high precision measurements. Moreover, it was discovered that the isotopes of oxygen had different natural abundances in water and in air. For these and other reasons, in 1961 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry , which had absorbed the ICAW, adopted a new definition of the atomic mass unit for use in both physics and chemistry; namely, 1 12 of the mass of a carbon 12 atom. This new value was intermediate between the two earlier definitions, but closer to the one used by chemists .The new unit was named the unified atomic mass unit and given a new symbol u , to replace the old amu that had been used for the oxygen based units. However, the old symbol amu has sometimes been used, after 1961, to refer to the new unit, particularly in lay and preparatory contexts. With this new definition, the standard atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.011 Da, and that of oxygen is approximately 15.999 Da. These values, generally used in chemistry, are based on averages of many samples from Earth's crust, its atmosphere, and organic materials.  Adoption by the BIPM  The IUPAC 1961 definition of the unified atomic mass unit, with that name and symbol u , was adopted by the International Bureau for Weights and Measures in 1971 as a non SI unit accepted for use with the SI.  Unit name  In 1993, the IUPAC proposed the shorter name dalton for the unified atomic mass unit. As with other unit names such as watt and newton, dalton is not capitalized in English, but its symbol, Da , is capitalized. The name was endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics in 2005.In 2003 the name was recommended to the BIPM by the Consultative Committee for Units, part of the CIPM, as it is shorter and works better with the SI prefixes . In 2006, the BIPM included the dalton in its 8th edition of the formal definition of SI. The name was also listed as an alternative to unified atomic mass unit by the International Organization for Standardization in 2009. It is now recommended by several scientific publishers, and some of them consider atomic mass unit and amu deprecated. In 2019, the BIPM retained the dalton in its 9th edition of the formal definition of SI while dropping the unified atomic mass unit from its table of non SI units accepted for use with the SI, but secondarily notes that the dalton and the unified atomic mass unit are alternative names for the same unit.  2019 redefinition of the SI base units  The definition of the dalton was not affected by the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, that is, 1 Da in the SI is still 1 12 of the mass of a carbon 12 atom, a quantity that must be determined experimentally in terms of SI units. However, the definition of a mole was changed to be the amount of substance consisting of exactly 6.02214076 1023 entities and the definition of the kilogram was changed as well. As a consequence, the molar mass constant is no longer exactly 1 g mol, meaning that the number of grams in the mass of one mole of any substance is no longer exactly equal to the number of daltons in its average molecular mass.  Measurement Although relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured for ions: hence, the measured values must be corrected for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the electron binding energy, Eb muc2. The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon 12 atom is 1030.1089 eV 1.6504163 10 16 J: Eb muc2 1.1058674 10 6, or about one part in 10 million of the mass of the atom.Before the 2019 redefinition of SI units, experiments were aimed to determine the value of the Avogadro constant for finding the value of the unified atomic mass unit.  Josef Loschmidt  A reasonably accurate value of the atomic mass unit was first obtained indirectly by Josef Loschmidt in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.  Jean Perrin  Perrin estimated the Avogadro number by a variety of methods, at the turn of the 20th century. He was awarded the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, largely for this work.  Coulometry  The electric charge per mole of elementary charges is a constant called the Faraday constant, F, whose value had been essentially known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis. In 1910, Robert Millikan obtained the first measurement of the charge on an electron, e. The quotient F e provided an estimate of the Avogadro constant.The classic experiment is that of Bower and Davis at NIST, and relies on dissolving silver metal away from the anode of an electrolysis cell, while passing a constant electric current I for a known time t. If m is the mass of silver lost from the anode and Ar the atomic weight of silver, then the Faraday constant is given by: The NIST scientists devised a method to compensate for silver lost from the anode by mechanical causes, and conducted an isotope analysis of the silver used to determine its atomic weight. Their value for the conventional Faraday constant was F90 96485.39 C mol, which corresponds to a value for the Avogadro constant of 6.0221449 1023 mol 1: both values have a relative standard uncertainty of 1.3 10 6.  Electron mass measurement  In practice, the atomic mass constant is determined from the electron rest mass me and the electron relative atomic mass Ar . The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants. where c is the speed of light, h is the Planck constant, is the fine structure constant, and R is the Rydberg constant. As may be observed from the old values in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant was the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation were known more precisely. The power of the presently defined values of universal constants can be understood from the table below .  X ray crystal density methods  Silicon single crystals may be produced today in commercial facilities with extremely high purity and with few lattice defects. This method defined the Avogadro constant as the ratio of the molar volume, Vm, to the atomic volume Vatom: where         V          a    t    o    m                       V             c     e     l     l               n          displaystyle V rm atom  frac V rm cell n  , and n is the number of atoms per unit cell of volume Vcell.The unit cell of silicon has a cubic packing arrangement of 8 atoms, and the unit cell volume may be measured by determining a single unit cell parameter, the length a of one of the sides of the cube. The 2018 CODATA value of a for silicon is 5.431020511 10 10 m.In practice, measurements are carried out on a distance known as d220 , which is the distance between the planes denoted by the Miller indices 220 , and is equal to a 8. The isotope proportional composition of the sample used must be measured and taken into account. Silicon occurs in three stable isotopes , and the natural variation in their proportions is greater than other uncertainties in the measurements. The atomic weight Ar for the sample crystal can be calculated, as the standard atomic weights of the three nuclides are known with great accuracy. This, together with the measured density of the sample, allows the molar volume Vm to be determined: where Mu is the molar mass constant. The 2018 CODATA value for the molar volume of silicon is 1.205883199 10 5 m3 mol 1, with a relative standard uncertainty of 4.9 10 8.

            "text": "Daniel Davis Jr. was an American science instrument maker, electrical engineer, mechanic, photographer, daguerreotypist and ambrotypist. Through the course of his work he became known for his practical knowledge and understanding of electromagnetic principles. He worked with college professors, notable electricians and popular scientists of the nineteenth century. He was consulted for practical knowledge on mechanics and electricity by inventors, including Samuel Morse for his telegraph and Elias Howe for his sewing machine. He was the first man in the United States to work with gold and silver electroplating, patented a method for coloring daguerrotypes through electroplating in 1842, and sold franchises to others for photographic studios. Davis published an exhaustive work on electromagnetism that became a textbook for academies, high schools, and colleges.  Early life Daniel Davis Jr. was born on February 8, 1813, in Princeton, Massachusetts. His father and brothers had a mechanical background. While growing up, Davis worked as a helper on his father's homestead until the age of twenty, and then moved to Boston in 1833. He was first employed as a laborer by a Mr. Darling, who had a soda factory called Darling Ireland on Franklin Avenue that produced carbonated water.Davis was much interested in electrical experimentation and soon became acquainted with one William King, who operated a small factory on Cornhill Street that made static electricity machinery and lightning rods. Davis was soon employed by King to install the lightning rods manufactured by King's factory. His first job was helping to put up the lightning rod on the Boston courthouse. The lightning rod was made of a solid copper rod laid out in a long flat ribbon shape. He also helped make and install the lightning rods on the wooden structures in the Charlestown Navy Yard.  Mid life Davis began doing business for himself in 1835 at No. 11 Cornhill Street in Boston. He engaged John Temple as his business partner, and they called the firm Davis Temple. Davis secured Temple's share of the firm in 1837 and began making electromagnetic mechanisms. As a philosophical instrument maker, he was the earliest manufacturer of electromagnetic apparatus in the United States. Among his customers were Robert Hare, Benjamin Silliman, Joseph Henry, Charles G. Page, John White Webster, Moses G. Farmer, William Francis Channing, Francis Thomas Bacon, and Edward Hitchcock. At that time there was no use for electricity in everyday applications for the general public, so Davis made a business out of making devices to illustrate the general principles of electricity. With Page, he devised and invented many electric tools and circuit components that were put into general use. Together they did electrical test trials and experiments to gather knowledge of outcomes for certain procedures. In the fall of 1839, Page took a position in the Patent Office in Washington, D.C., as an examiner of patents related to electrical apparatus. Davis's business increased rapidly, as he was the only person in the United States who manufactured electromagnetic devices. He did not consider patents for his inventions; had he obtained such rights on his innovations and developments, he would have become wealthy instead of merely making an average business income. Davis made a daguerreotype apparatus set in 1840 soon after Professor Gareaux of Paris came to Boston with the invention. He took one of the first daguerrotype pictures taken in the United States, of the old German Catholic Church on Shawmut Avenue in Boston. The picture was taken when witnesses saw a gentleman standing at the side of the church holding his wooden cane in his clutched right hand. When Davis developed and finished the picture out, to the surprise of these witnesses, the crooked cane was in the man's left hand. This puzzled them for some time, until they learned that the picture rendered on a darkened surface, was a reversed image.Davis was the first person in the United States to work with gold and silver electroplating as a business. He first advertised for this business in the Boston Post newspaper in 1842 at his Cornhill location. His 1843 advertisement added medical applications and read: Magneto Electric Gilding and Silvering done to order by Daniel Davis, Jr., 11 Cornhill, Boston, Mass. Watches, Spoons, Knives, Thimbles, Brass or Copper Ornaments, of all descriptions, Gilt or Silvered Surgical and Dental Instruments, Knives and Forks, etc. Gilt in the best manner, at the lowest prices, and warranted superior to any other process. Apparatus for Gilding and Silvering at reasonable prices. Apparatus for illustrating the principles of Magnetism, Electro Magnetism, Magneto Electricity, and Thermo Electricity. Improved Magneto Electric Apparatus, for medical use. Electricity Medically applied at No 11 Cornhill. He taught others these electromagnetic techniques for their businesses. In 1842, Davis patented a method for coloring daguerreotypes through electroplating, and then sold franchise rights to other photographers like John Plumbe to set up photography galleries across the nation. Davis was awarded gold medals from various exhibitions for his electrical and mechanical innovations. One gold medal was received in 1840 from the Massachusetts Charitable Association for a complete set of electromagnetic apparatus for the Vermont Medical College. Davis's shop in Boston was the headquarters for college professors and experienced electricians for many years. It was frequented by many of the scientists and inventors of the time. Samuel Morse in 1844 asked Davis for help in developing out his telegraph. Davis made Elias Howe's first sewing machine, with the assistance of his brother Ari, at his workplace on Cornhill Street in Boston. One of Davis's sizable projects was a couple of large scale electric generators that were powered by railroad steam locomotives from the Boston and Lowell Railroad.  Davis's Manual of Magnetism  Davis had practical knowledge of mechanics and published an exhaustive work on electricity and magnetism titled A Manual of Magnetism, including Galvanism, Magnetism, Electro Magnetism, Electro Dynamics, Magneto Electricity and Thermo Electricity. The manual cost 75 cents in 1842 , and was an expanded catalog in the form of a book, containing more than a hundred original detailed hand drawings to illustrate and explain these principles. It was the first catalogue published on philosophical instruments. Davis originally published this manual to advertise his wares and call attention to his business. He furnished a list of more than a hundred hand made electrical items with prices for the items that averaged around 5 each with dozens of magnets and batteries for sale that had an average price of 1 . Davis's manual was not made as a textbook on electrotechnics, but its value as a reference book of electrical information was at once seen, and it was put into wide use. It was the first American textbook on electricity.Davis's electrical manual for the use of students and literary institutions was first printed in 1842, with an enlarged edition following in 1848. Both were written under the supervision of William Francis Channing, who brought an elegant, clear style of writing that made the book a success. It was adopted by several colleges and high schools in the nation. It became a favorite of the United States Military Academy at West Point for the practical demonstrations shown in the pages. There were at least twelve more editions of the manual until 1872. Many trained electricians from 1842 to 1872 had confessed that they had learned their skills from Davis's manual.  Electromagnetic devices for medical purposes  In 1838, Davis already had a reputation for electromagnetic devices for medical remedies that he made at his Cornhill shop. He described in his 1842 Manual of Magnetism that electric sparks and electric shocks could be used for medical purposes. These were produced by high voltages through electromagnetic devices that he made. He constructed various styles and types of electromagnetic devices that would turn low voltage into high voltage that would produce electrical sparks and shocks to a person.In 1846, Davis published a 24 page supplemental manual called Medical Application of Electricity, specifically on the application of electricity in medical procedures using electromagnetic apparatus devices he made. He says in this booklet that electricity through his devices was being used to treat disease of the muscular system. He pointed out that electricity itself was not the direct agent for the cure, but acted as a vital stimulant to help the body do the curing. With this idea in mind, electricity was used for the treatment of paralysis and all sorts of nervous disorders. This was carried still further to treat almost every disease of every nature and class in which the nervous system played a role. He pointed out that the new field of curing a body of a disease using electricity was experimental and should be used carefully under the supervision of a medical practitioner.A class of instruments to which Davis referred was the magneto electric machines that did not use batteries, but were powered by hand to make electricity. He described a strong permanent steel magnet as being the source of electrical power. In the Hand shocker figure, the letter S is the south pole of a permanent U magnet. The letter A represents a U armature of soft iron mounted on an axis that can revolve around rapidly by means of the hand operated wheel pulley mechanism. The iron ends rotated around the magnet poles of North and South of the permanent steel magnet. On the legs of this armature are wound coils of wire connected together. Whenever the legs of the armature approach or recede from the poles of the strong permanent magnet they acquire or lose magnetism and accordingly electrical currents are generated in the coils of wire. This electricity passes by another coil and is mechanically intermittently broken by the revolution of the hand wheel mechanism. This collapsing and building of magnetic fields between the coils produces a high voltage shock to the medical patient.  Electrotype copying process  In his Manual of Magnetism, Davis explains that the term electrotype is the copying of coins, award medals, plaster casts and engraved copper plates using electricity. He explains the process of low temperature melting metallic solutions being used to form a mold of the original object. The metallic solution then is electrified with a current and deposited on a battery plate of opposite charge, giving an exact copy of the original object that was molded. The copies are electrotypes, since they are a type of the original produced by electricity. The elaborate process is referred to as The Electrotype technique.The frontispiece to the Manual depicts an engraving printed from an electrotype plate as a specimen of the technique. Very little difference can be detected between the impressions from the original copper plate and the electrotype copy made by Davis. This was an important application of 19th century electrotype where a large number of impressions were to be made. It was only necessary to engrave one plate, and it was not marred in the slightest degree by taking many copies from it using the electrotype technique. John W. Wilcox, the foreman for Davis, was the first commercial electrotyper.  Later life and death Davis was successful in the electrical field for 15 years, and in 1848 sold his firm and retired to his farm in Princeton, where he passed the remainder of his days in agricultural pursuits. He died at the age of 74 on March 22, 1887.

            "text": "Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit FRS was a physicist, inventor, and scientific instrument maker. Born in Poland to a family of German extraction, he later moved to the Dutch Republic at age 15, where he spent the rest of his life . A pioneer of exact thermometry, he helped lay the foundations for the era of precision thermometry by inventing the mercury in glass thermometer and Fahrenheit scale.  Biography Fahrenheit was born in Danzig , then in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, but lived most of his life in the Dutch Republic. The Fahrenheits were a German Hanse merchant family who had lived in several Hanseatic cities. Fahrenheit's great grandfather had lived in Rostock, and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in Hildesheim. Daniel's grandfather moved from Kneiphof in K nigsberg to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit , married Concordia Schumann, the daughter of a well known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elisabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Kr ger and was the mother of Benjamin Ephraim Kr ger, a clergyman and playwright.Daniel Gabriel began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating poisonous mushrooms. However, Fahrenheit's interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to Berlin, Halle, Leipzig, Dresden, Copenhagen, and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with Ole R mer, Christian Wolff, and Gottfried Leibniz. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in The Hague as a glassblower, making barometers, altimeters, and thermometers. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in chemistry in Amsterdam. He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. From August 1736 Fahrenheit stayed in the house of Johannes Frisleven at Plein square in The Hague, in connection with an application for a patent at the States of Holland and West Friesland. At the beginning of September, he became ill and on the 7th his health had deteriorated to such an extent that he had notary Willem Ruijsbroek come to draw up his will. On the 11th the notary came by again to make some changes. Five days after that Fahrenheit died at the age of fifty. Four days later he received the fourth class funeral of one who is classified as destitute, in the Kloosterkerk in The Hague .  Fahrenheit scale  According to Fahrenheit's 1724 article, he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of temperature. The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a frigorific mixture of ice, water, and a salt , and waiting for the eutectic system to reach equilibrium temperature. The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point. The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0 F. The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface. This was assigned as 30 F. The third calibration point, taken as 90 F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.Fahrenheit came up with the idea that mercury boils around 300 degrees on this temperature scale. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point. The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing to boiling interval exactly 180 degrees, a convenient value as 180 is a highly composite number, meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal mean body temperature today is taken as 98.6 degrees, whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale.The Fahrenheit scale was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English speaking countries until the 1970s, nowadays mostly replaced by the Celsius scale long used in the rest of the world, apart from the United States, where temperatures and weather reports are still broadcast in Fahrenheit.

            "text": "In information theory, data compression, source coding, or bit rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process as a decoder. The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding; encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted. Source coding should not be confused with channel coding, for error detection and correction or line coding, the means for mapping data onto a signal. Compression is useful because it reduces the resources required to store and transmit data. Computational resources are consumed in the compression and decompression processes. Data compression is subject to a space time complexity trade off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be decompressed fast enough to be viewed as it is being decompressed, and the option to decompress the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced , and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.  Lossless  Lossless data compression algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy to represent data without losing any information, so that the process is reversible. Lossless compression is possible because most real world data exhibits statistical redundancy. For example, an image may have areas of color that do not change over several pixels; instead of coding red pixel, red pixel, ... the data may be encoded as 279 red pixels . This is a basic example of run length encoding; there are many schemes to reduce file size by eliminating redundancy. The Lempel Ziv compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage. DEFLATE is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. In the mid 1980s, following work by Terry Welch, the Lempel Ziv Welch algorithm rapidly became the method of choice for most general purpose compression systems. LZW is used in GIF images, programs such as PKZIP, and hardware devices such as modems. LZ methods use a table based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often Huffman encoded. Grammar based codes like this can compress highly repetitive input extremely effectively, for instance, a biological data collection of the same or closely related species, a huge versioned document collection, internet archival, etc. The basic task of grammar based codes is constructing a context free grammar deriving a single string. Other practical grammar compression algorithms include Sequitur and Re Pair. The strongest modern lossless compressors use probabilistic models, such as prediction by partial matching. The Burrows Wheeler transform can also be viewed as an indirect form of statistical modelling. In a further refinement of the direct use of probabilistic modelling, statistical estimates can be coupled to an algorithm called arithmetic coding. Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a finite state machine to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression compared to other techniques such as the better known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one to one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was in an optional feature of the JPEG image coding standard. It has since been applied in various other designs including H.263, H.264 MPEG 4 AVC and HEVC for video coding.Archive software typically has the ability to adjust the dictionary size , where a larger size demands more random access memory during compression and decompression, but compresses stronger, especially on repeating patterns in files' content.  Lossy  In the late 1980s, digital images became more common, and standards for lossless image compression emerged. In the early 1990s, lossy compression methods began to be widely used. In these schemes, some loss of information is accepted as dropping nonessential detail can save storage space. There is a corresponding trade off between preserving information and reducing size. Lossy data compression schemes are designed by research on how people perceive the data in question. For example, the human eye is more sensitive to subtle variations in luminance than it is to the variations in color. JPEG image compression works in part by rounding off nonessential bits of information. A number of popular compression formats exploit these perceptual differences, including psychoacoustics for sound, and psychovisuals for images and video. Most forms of lossy compression are based on transform coding, especially the discrete cosine transform . It was first proposed in 1972 by Nasir Ahmed, who then developed a working algorithm with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1973, before introducing it in January 1974. DCT is the most widely used lossy compression method, and is used in multimedia formats for images , video and audio . Lossy image compression is used in digital cameras, to increase storage capacities. Similarly, DVDs, Blu ray and streaming video use lossy video coding formats. Lossy compression is extensively used in video. In lossy audio compression, methods of psychoacoustics are used to remove non audible components of the audio signal. Compression of human speech is often performed with even more specialized techniques; speech coding is distinguished as a separate discipline from general purpose audio compression. Speech coding is used in internet telephony, for example, audio compression is used for CD ripping and is decoded by the audio players.Lossy compression can cause generation loss.  Theory  The theoretical basis for compression is provided by information theory and, more specifically, algorithmic information theory for lossless compression and rate distortion theory for lossy compression. These areas of study were essentially created by Claude Shannon, who published fundamental papers on the topic in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Other topics associated with compression include coding theory and statistical inference.  Machine learning  There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression . Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction . This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence .An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C we define an associated vector space , such that C maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm x . An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can't unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.  Data differencing  Data compression can be viewed as a special case of data differencing. Data differencing consists of producing a difference given a source and a target, with patching reproducing the target given a source and a difference. Since there is no separate source and target in data compression, one can consider data compression as data differencing with empty source data, the compressed file corresponding to a difference from nothing. This is the same as considering absolute entropy as a special case of relative entropy with no initial data. The term differential compression is used to emphasize the data differencing connection.  Uses   Image  Entropy coding originated in the 1940s with the introduction of Shannon Fano coding, the basis for Huffman coding which was developed in 1950. Transform coding dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of fast Fourier transform coding in 1968 and the Hadamard transform in 1969.An important image compression technique is the discrete cosine transform , a technique developed in the early 1970s. DCT is the basis for JPEG, a lossy compression format which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992. JPEG greatly reduces the amount of data required to represent an image at the cost of a relatively small reduction in image quality and has become the most widely used image file format. Its highly efficient DCT based compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of digital images and digital photos.Lempel Ziv Welch is a lossless compression algorithm developed in 1984. It is used in the GIF format, introduced in 1987. DEFLATE, a lossless compression algorithm specified in 1996, is used in the Portable Network Graphics format.Wavelet compression, the use of wavelets in image compression, began after the development of DCT coding. The JPEG 2000 standard was introduced in 2000. In contrast to the DCT algorithm used by the original JPEG format, JPEG 2000 instead uses discrete wavelet transform algorithms. JPEG 2000 technology, which includes the Motion JPEG 2000 extension, was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004.  Audio  Audio data compression, not to be confused with dynamic range compression, has the potential to reduce the transmission bandwidth and storage requirements of audio data. Audio compression algorithms are implemented in software as audio codecs. In both lossy and lossless compression, information redundancy is reduced, using methods such as coding, quantization, discrete cosine transform and linear prediction to reduce the amount of information used to represent the uncompressed data. Lossy audio compression algorithms provide higher compression and are used in numerous audio applications including Vorbis and MP3. These algorithms almost all rely on psychoacoustics to eliminate or reduce fidelity of less audible sounds, thereby reducing the space required to store or transmit them.The acceptable trade off between loss of audio quality and transmission or storage size depends upon the application. For example, one 640 MB compact disc holds approximately one hour of uncompressed high fidelity music, less than 2 hours of music compressed losslessly, or 7 hours of music compressed in the MP3 format at a medium bit rate. A digital sound recorder can typically store around 200 hours of clearly intelligible speech in 640 MB.Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that can be decoded to an exact digital duplicate of the original. Compression ratios are around 50 60 of the original size, which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless codecs use curve fitting or linear prediction as a basis for estimating the signal. Parameters describing the estimation and the difference between the estimation and the actual signal are coded separately.A number of lossless audio compression formats exist. See list of lossless codecs for a listing. Some formats are associated with a distinct system, such as Direct Stream Transfer, used in Super Audio CD and Meridian Lossless Packing, used in DVD Audio, Dolby TrueHD, Blu ray and HD DVD. Some audio file formats feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction; this allows stripping the correction to easily obtain a lossy file. Such formats include MPEG 4 SLS , WavPack, and OptimFROG DualStream. When audio files are to be processed, either by further compression or for editing, it is desirable to work from an unchanged original . Processing of a lossily compressed file for some purpose usually produces a final result inferior to the creation of the same compressed file from an uncompressed original. In addition to sound editing or mixing, lossless audio compression is often used for archival storage, or as master copies.  Lossy audio compression  Lossy audio compression is used in a wide range of applications. In addition to standalone audio only applications of file playback in MP3 players or computers, digitally compressed audio streams are used in most video DVDs, digital television, streaming media on the Internet, satellite and cable radio, and increasingly in terrestrial radio broadcasts. Lossy compression typically achieves far greater compression than lossless compression, by discarding less critical data based on psychoacoustic optimizations.Psychoacoustics recognizes that not all data in an audio stream can be perceived by the human auditory system. Most lossy compression reduces redundancy by first identifying perceptually irrelevant sounds, that is, sounds that are very hard to hear. Typical examples include high frequencies or sounds that occur at the same time as louder sounds. Those irrelevant sounds are coded with decreased accuracy or not at all. Due to the nature of lossy algorithms, audio quality suffers a digital generation loss when a file is decompressed and recompressed. This makes lossy compression unsuitable for storing the intermediate results in professional audio engineering applications, such as sound editing and multitrack recording. However, lossy formats such as MP3 are very popular with end users as the file size is reduced to 5 20 of the original size and a megabyte can store about a minute's worth of music at adequate quality.   Coding methods  To determine what information in an audio signal is perceptually irrelevant, most lossy compression algorithms use transforms such as the modified discrete cosine transform to convert time domain sampled waveforms into a transform domain, typically the frequency domain. Once transformed, component frequencies can be prioritized according to how audible they are. Audibility of spectral components is assessed using the absolute threshold of hearing and the principles of simultaneous masking the phenomenon wherein a signal is masked by another signal separated by frequency and, in some cases, temporal masking where a signal is masked by another signal separated by time. Equal loudness contours may also be used to weigh the perceptual importance of components. Models of the human ear brain combination incorporating such effects are often called psychoacoustic models.Other types of lossy compressors, such as the linear predictive coding used with speech, are source based coders. LPC uses a model of the human vocal tract to analyze speech sounds and infer the parameters used by the model to produce them moment to moment. These changing parameters are transmitted or stored and used to drive another model in the decoder which reproduces the sound. Lossy formats are often used for the distribution of streaming audio or interactive communication . In such applications, the data must be decompressed as the data flows, rather than after the entire data stream has been transmitted. Not all audio codecs can be used for streaming applications.Latency is introduced by the methods used to encode and decode the data. Some codecs will analyze a longer segment, called a frame, of the data to optimize efficiency, and then code it in a manner that requires a larger segment of data at one time to decode. The inherent latency of the coding algorithm can be critical; for example, when there is a two way transmission of data, such as with a telephone conversation, significant delays may seriously degrade the perceived quality. In contrast to the speed of compression, which is proportional to the number of operations required by the algorithm, here latency refers to the number of samples that must be analyzed before a block of audio is processed. In the minimum case, latency is zero samples . Time domain algorithms such as LPC also often have low latencies, hence their popularity in speech coding for telephony. In algorithms such as MP3, however, a large number of samples have to be analyzed to implement a psychoacoustic model in the frequency domain, and latency is on the order of 23 ms.   Speech encoding  Speech encoding is an important category of audio data compression. The perceptual models used to estimate what aspects of speech a human ear can hear are generally somewhat different from those used for music. The range of frequencies needed to convey the sounds of a human voice is normally far narrower than that needed for music, and the sound is normally less complex. As a result, speech can be encoded at high quality using a relatively low bit rate. This is accomplished, in general, by some combination of two approaches: Only encoding sounds that could be made by a single human voice. Throwing away more of the data in the signal keeping just enough to reconstruct an intelligible voice rather than the full frequency range of human hearing.The earliest algorithms used in speech encoding were the A law algorithm and the law algorithm.  History  Early audio research was conducted at Bell Labs. There, in 1950, C. Chapin Cutler filed the patent on differential pulse code modulation . In 1973, Adaptive DPCM was introduced by P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant and James L. Flanagan.Perceptual coding was first used for speech coding compression, with linear predictive coding . Initial concepts for LPC date back to the work of Fumitada Itakura and Shuzo Saito in 1966. During the 1970s, Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs developed a form of LPC called adaptive predictive coding , a perceptual coding algorithm that exploited the masking properties of the human ear, followed in the early 1980s with the code excited linear prediction algorithm which achieved a significant compression ratio for its time. Perceptual coding is used by modern audio compression formats such as MP3 and AAC. Discrete cosine transform , developed by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974, provided the basis for the modified discrete cosine transform used by modern audio compression formats such as MP3, Dolby Digital, and AAC. MDCT was proposed by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley in 1987, following earlier work by Princen and Bradley in 1986.The world's first commercial broadcast automation audio compression system was developed by Oscar Bonello, an engineering professor at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1983, using the psychoacoustic principle of the masking of critical bands first published in 1967, he started developing a practical application based on the recently developed IBM PC computer, and the broadcast automation system was launched in 1987 under the name Audicom. Twenty years later, almost all the radio stations in the world were using similar technology manufactured by a number of companies. A literature compendium for a large variety of audio coding systems was published in the IEEE's Journal on Selected Areas in Communications , in February 1988. While there were some papers from before that time, this collection documented an entire variety of finished, working audio coders, nearly all of them using perceptual techniques and some kind of frequency analysis and back end noiseless coding.  Video  Uncompressed video requires a very high data rate. Although lossless video compression codecs perform at a compression factor of 5 to 12, a typical H.264 lossy compression video has a compression factor between 20 and 200.The two key video compression techniques used in video coding standards are the discrete cosine transform and motion compensation . Most video coding standards, such as the H.26x and MPEG formats, typically use motion compensated DCT video coding .Most video codecs are used alongside audio compression techniques to store the separate but complementary data streams as one combined package using so called container formats.  Encoding theory  Video data may be represented as a series of still image frames. Such data usually contains abundant amounts of spatial and temporal redundancy. Video compression algorithms attempt to reduce redundancy and store information more compactly. Most video compression formats and codecs exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy . Similarities can be encoded by only storing differences between e.g. temporally adjacent frames or spatially adjacent pixels . Inter frame compression uses data from one or more earlier or later frames in a sequence to describe the current frame. Intra frame coding, on the other hand, uses only data from within the current frame, effectively being still image compression.The intra frame video coding formats used in camcorders and video editing employ simpler compression that uses only intra frame prediction. This simplifies video editing software, as it prevents a situation in which a compressed frame refers to data that the editor has deleted. Usually, video compression additionally employs lossy compression techniques like quantization that reduce aspects of the source data that are irrelevant to the human visual perception by exploiting perceptual features of human vision. For example, small differences in color are more difficult to perceive than are changes in brightness. Compression algorithms can average a color across these similar areas in a manner similar to those used in JPEG image compression. As in all lossy compression, there is a trade off between video quality and bit rate, cost of processing the compression and decompression, and system requirements. Highly compressed video may present visible or distracting artifacts. Other methods other than the prevalent DCT based transform formats, such as fractal compression, matching pursuit and the use of a discrete wavelet transform , have been the subject of some research, but are typically not used in practical products. Wavelet compression is used in still image coders and video coders without motion compensation. Interest in fractal compression seems to be waning, due to recent theoretical analysis showing a comparative lack of effectiveness of such methods.   Inter frame coding  In inter frame coding, individual frames of a video sequence are compared from one frame to the next, and the video compression codec records the differences to the reference frame. If the frame contains areas where nothing has moved, the system can simply issue a short command that copies that part of the previous frame into the next one. If sections of the frame move in a simple manner, the compressor can emit a command that tells the decompressor to shift, rotate, lighten, or darken the copy. This longer command still remains much shorter than data generated by intra frame compression. Usually, the encoder will also transmit a residue signal which describes the remaining more subtle differences to the reference imagery. Using entropy coding, these residue signals have a more compact representation than the full signal. In areas of video with more motion, the compression must encode more data to keep up with the larger number of pixels that are changing. Commonly during explosions, flames, flocks of animals, and in some panning shots, the high frequency detail leads to quality decreases or to increases in the variable bitrate.  Hybrid block based transform formats  Today, nearly all commonly used video compression methods share the same basic architecture that dates back to H.261 which was standardized in 1988 by the ITU T. They mostly rely on the DCT, applied to rectangular blocks of neighboring pixels, and temporal prediction using motion vectors, as well as nowadays also an in loop filtering step. In the prediction stage, various deduplication and difference coding techniques are applied that help decorrelate data and describe new data based on already transmitted data. Then rectangular blocks of remaining pixel data are transformed to the frequency domain. In the main lossy processing stage, frequency domain data gets quantized in order to reduce information that is irrelevant to human visual perception. In the last stage statistical redundancy gets largely eliminated by an entropy coder which often applies some form of arithmetic coding. In an additional in loop filtering stage various filters can be applied to the reconstructed image signal. By computing these filters also inside the encoding loop they can help compression because they can be applied to reference material before it gets used in the prediction process and they can be guided using the original signal. The most popular example are deblocking filters that blur out blocking artifacts from quantization discontinuities at transform block boundaries.  History  In 1967, A.H. Robinson and C. Cherry proposed a run length encoding bandwidth compression scheme for the transmission of analog television signals. Discrete cosine transform , which is fundamental to modern video compression, was introduced by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974.H.261, which debuted in 1988, commercially introduced the prevalent basic architecture of video compression technology. It was the first video coding format based on DCT compression. H.261 was developed by a number of companies, including Hitachi, PictureTel, NTT, BT and Toshiba.The most popular video coding standards used for codecs have been the MPEG standards. MPEG 1 was developed by the Motion Picture Experts Group in 1991, and it was designed to compress VHS quality video. It was succeeded in 1994 by MPEG 2 H.262, which was developed by a number of companies, primarily Sony, Thomson and Mitsubishi Electric. MPEG 2 became the standard video format for DVD and SD digital television. In 1999, it was followed by MPEG 4 H.263. It was also developed by a number of companies, primarily Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and Panasonic.H.264 MPEG 4 AVC was developed in 2003 by a number of organizations, primarily Panasonic, Godo Kaisha IP Bridge and LG Electronics. AVC commercially introduced the modern context adaptive binary arithmetic coding and context adaptive variable length coding algorithms. AVC is the main video encoding standard for Blu ray Discs, and is widely used by video sharing websites and streaming internet services such as YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, and iTunes Store, web software such as Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight, and various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial and satellite television.  Genetics  Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20 fold compression , providing 2 to 4 fold better compression and is less computationally intensive than the leading general purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding , which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms developed in 2009 and 2013 have compression ratios of up to 1200 fold allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes . For a benchmark in genetics genomics data compressors, see  Outlook and currently unused potential It is estimated that the total amount of data that is stored on the world's storage devices could be further compressed with existing compression algorithms by a remaining average factor of 4.5:1. It is estimated that the combined technological capacity of the world to store information provides 1,300 exabytes of hardware digits in 2007, but when the corresponding content is optimally compressed, this only represents 295 exabytes of Shannon information.

            "text": "Dawon Kahng was a Korean American electrical engineer and inventor, known for his work in solid state electronics. He is best known for inventing the MOSFET , along with his colleague Mohamed Atalla, in 1959. Kahng and Atalla developed both the PMOS and NMOS processes for MOSFET semiconductor device fabrication. The MOSFET is the most widely used type of transistor, and the basic element in most modern electronic equipment. Kahng and Atalla later proposed the concept of the MOS integrated circuit, and they did pioneering work on Schottky diodes and nanolayer base transistors in the early 1960s. Kahng then invented the floating gate MOSFET with Simon Min Sze in 1967. Kahng and Sze proposed that FGMOS could be used as floating gate memory cells for non volatile memory and reprogrammable read only memory , which became the basis for EPROM , EEPROM and flash memory technologies. Kahng was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2009.  Biography Dawon Kahng was born on May 4, 1931, in Keij , Ch sen . He studied physics at Seoul National University in South Korea, and immigrated to the United States in 1955 to attend Ohio State University, where he received a doctorate in electrical engineering in 1959. He was a researcher at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and he invented MOSFET , which is the basic element in most of today's electronic equipment, with Mohamed Atalla in 1959. They fabricated both PMOS and NMOS devices with a 20 m process.Extending their work on MOS technology, Kahng and Atalla next did pioneering work on hot carrier devices, which used what would later be called a Schottky barrier. The Schottky diode, also known as the Schottky barrier diode, was theorized for years, but was first practically realized as a result of the work of Kahng and Atalla during 1960 1961. They published their results in 1962 and called their device the hot electron triode structure with semiconductor metal emitter. The Schottky diode went on to assume a prominent role in mixer applications. They later conducted further research on high frequency Schottky diodes.In 1962, Kahng and Atalla proposed and demonstrated an early metal nanolayer base transistor. This device has a metallic layer with nanometric thickness sandwiched between two semiconducting layers, with the metal forming the base and the semiconductors forming the emitter and collector. With its low resistance and short transit times in the thin metallic nanolayer base, the device was capable of high operation frequency compared to bipolar transistors. Their pioneering work involved depositing metal layers on top of single crystal semiconductor substrates , with the emitter being a crystalline semiconductor piece with a top or a blunt corner pressed against the metallic layer . They deposited gold thin films with a thickness of 10 nm on n type germanium , while the point contact was n type silicon .Along with his colleague Simon Min Sze, he invented the floating gate MOSFET, which they first reported in 1967. They also invented the floating gate memory cell, the foundation for many forms of semiconductor memory devices. He invented floating gate non volatile memory in 1967, and proposed that the floating gate of an MOS semiconductor device could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM, which became the basis for EPROM , EEPROM and flash memory technologies. He also conducted research on ferro electric semiconductors and luminous materials, and made important contributions to the field of electroluminescence.After retiring from Bell Laboratories, he became the founding president of the NEC Research Institute in New Jersey. He was a fellow of the IEEE and a fellow of the Bell Laboratories. He was also a recipient of the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute and the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Ohio State University College of Engineering. He died of complications following emergency surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm in 1992.  Awards and honors Kahng and Mohamed Atalla were awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal at the 1975 Franklin Institute Awards, for their invention of the MOSFET. In 2009, Kahng was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2014, the 1959 invention of the MOSFET was included on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics.  References",

Around that time, notable inventors such as Guglielmo Marconi, Nikola Tesla, Harry Grindell Matthews, Edwin R. Scott, Erich Graichen and others claimed to have invented it independently. In 1957, the National Inventors Council was still issuing lists of needed military inventions that included a death ray.While based in fiction, research into energy based weapons inspired by past speculation has contributed to real life weapons in use by modern militaries sometimes called a sort of death ray , such as the United States Navy and its Laser Weapon System deployed in mid 2014. Such armaments are technically known as directed energy weapons.  History In 1923, Edwin R. Scott, an inventor from San Francisco, claimed he was the first to develop a death ray that would destroy human life and bring down planes at a distance. He was born in Detroit, and he claimed he worked for nine years as a student and prot g of Charles P. Steinmetz. Harry Grindell Matthews tried to sell what he reported to be a death ray to the British Air Ministry in 1924. He was never able to show a functioning model or demonstrate it to the military.Nikola Tesla claimed to have invented a death beam which he called teleforce in the 1930s and continued the claims up until his death. Tesla explained that this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so called 'death rays'. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. Tesla proposed that a nation could destroy anything approaching within 200 miles... and will provide a wall of power in order to make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack . He claimed to have worked on the project since about 1900, and said that it drew power from the ionosphere, which he called an invisible ball of energy surrounding Earth . He said that he had done this with the help of a 50 foot tesla coil. Antonio Longoria in 1934 claimed to have a death ray that could kill pigeons from four miles away and could kill a mouse enclosed in a thick walled metal chamber .During World War II, the Germans had at least two projects, and the Japanese one, to create so called death rays. One German project led by Ernst Schiebold concerned a particle accelerator with a steerable bundle of beryllium rods running through the vertical axis. The other was developed by Dr. Rolf Wider e and is referred to in his biography. The machine developed by Wider e was in the Dresden Plasma Physics laboratory in February 1945 when the city was bombed. Wider e led a team in March 1945 to remove the device from the ruined laboratory and deliver it to General Patton's 3rd Army at Burggrub where it was taken into US custody on 14 April 1945. The Japanese weapon was called Death ray Ku Go which aimed to employ microwaves created in a large magnetron.  In science fiction The concept of a death ray has fueled science fiction stories at least as early as Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy's 1927 novel The Garin Death Ray. Later science fiction introduced the concept of the handheld raygun used by fictional characters such as Flash Gordon. In Alfred Noyes' 1940 novel The Last Man , a death ray developed by a German scientist named Mardok is unleashed in a global war and almost wipes out the human race. Similar weapons are found in spy fi films such as Murderers' Row and George Lucas's science fiction saga Star Wars.

            "text": "Digital media refers to any communication media that operate in conjunction with various encoded machine readable data formats. Digital media can be created, viewed, distributed, modified, listened to, and preserved on a digital electronics device. Digital defines as any data represented by a series of digits, and media refers to methods of broadcasting or communicating this information. Together, digital media refers to mediums of digitized information broadcast through a screen and or a speaker. This also includes text, audio, video, and graphics that are transmitted over the internet for viewing or listening to on the internet.Digital media platforms, such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Twitch, accounted for viewership rates of 27.9 billion hours in 2020.  Digital media Examples of digital media include software, digital images, digital video, video games, web pages and websites, social media, digital data and databases, digital audio such as MP3, electronic documents and electronic books. Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as photographic film, audio tapes or video tapes. Digital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the Internet and personal computing, digital media has caused disruptive innovation in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to copyright and intellectual property laws, fostering an open content movement in which content creators voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the Information Age, perhaps leading to a paperless society in which all media are produced and consumed on computers. However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, censorship, the digital divide, and the spectre of a digital dark age, in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems. Digital media has a significant, wide ranging and complex impact on society and culture.  Types of Digital Media  Paid MediaPaid media refers to promotional channels that marketers pay to use, including traditional media , online and digital media . This model compels businesses to develop sponsored media then pay social media platforms like Instagram for the right to show such media to customers in the platforms newsfeeds. These customers become exposed to paid media, sometimes referred to as promoted or sponsored posts. Owned MediaIn this case, the company owns and manages the promotion channels, including the company s website, blog, official social media accounts, brand communities, marketers, and promotional activities. This type builds long term relationships with direct and potential users and earns media exposure. Comparably, blogs, social media, and other channels become website extensions, while these three facets comprise brand extensions. The more owned media a business has, the more opportunities it has to spread its brand presence within the Internet realm. Earned MediaEarned Media denotes public relations media channels like television, newspapers, blogs, or video sites that do not require direct payment or control by marketers but are included because viewers, readers, or users are interested in them. Free media is essentially online word of mouth, typically in viral trends, mentions, shares, retweets, reviews, recommendations, or content from third party websites. When one s product or service is so good that users cannot help but post it on their social media, they get a lot of earned media. They win the credibility of the media compared to other forms of credibility, becoming more transparent.  History Codes and information by machines were first conceptualized by Charles Babbage in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations. Between 1822 and 1823, Ada Lovelace, mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program. Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched  there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached. Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and weaving machines. It is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1 of the world's media storage capacity was digital and in 2007 it was already 94 . The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog media .  Digital computers  Though they used machine readable media, Babbage's engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many other early calculating machines were themselves analog computers, with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media came into existence with the rise of digital computers. Digital computers use binary code and Boolean logic to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the Manchester Mark 1 and the EDSAC, were independently invented between 1948 and 1949. Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their logical operations. They were encoded in binary, a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the digits of digital media.  As We May Think  While digital media did not come into common use until the late 20th century, the conceptual foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer Vannevar Bush and his celebrated essay As We May Think, published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1945. Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, and historians, among others, to store, analyze and communicate information. Calling this then imaginary device a memex , Bush wrote: The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically, he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First, he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, and leaves it projected. Next, in history, he finds another pertinent item and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him. Bush hoped that the creation of this memex would be the work of scientists after World War II. Though the essay predated digital computers by several years, As We May Think anticipated the potential social and intellectual benefits of digital media and provided the conceptual framework for digital scholarship, the World Wide Web, wikis and even social media. It was recognized as a significant work even at the time of its publication.  Impact   The digital revolution  Since the 1960s, computing power and storage capacity have increased exponentially, largely as a result of MOSFET scaling which enables MOS transistor counts to increase at a rapid pace predicted by Moore's law. Personal computers and smartphones put the ability to access, modify, store and share digital media in the hands of billions of people. Many electronic devices, from digital cameras to drones have the ability to create, transmit and view digital media. Combined with the World Wide Web and the Internet, digital media has transformed 21st century society in a way that is frequently compared to the cultural, economic and social impact of the printing press. The change has been so rapid and so widespread that it has launched an economic transition from an industrial economy to an information based economy, creating a new period in human history known as the Information Age or the digital revolution.The transition has created some uncertainty about definitions. Digital media, new media, multimedia, and similar terms all have a relationship to both the engineering innovations and cultural impact of digital media. The blending of digital media with other media, and with cultural and social factors, is sometimes known as new media or the new media. Similarly, digital media seems to demand a new set of communications skills, called transliteracy, media literacy, or digital literacy. These skills include not only the ability to read and write traditional literacy but the ability to navigate the Internet, evaluate sources, and create digital content. The idea that we are moving toward a fully digital, paperless society is accompanied by the fear that we may soon or currently be facing a digital dark age, in which older media are no longer accessible on modern devices or using modern methods of scholarship. Digital media has a significant, wide ranging and complex effect on society and culture.A senior engineer at Motorola named Martin Cooper was the first person to make a phone call on April 3, 1973. He decided the first phone call should be to a rival telecommunications company saying I'm speaking via a mobile phone . However the first commercial mobile phone was released in 1983 by Motorola. In the early 1990s Nokia came into succession, with their Nokia 1011 being the first mass produced mobile phone. The Nokia Communicator 9000 became the first smartphone as it was inputed with an Intel 24 MHz CPU and had 8 MB of RAM. Smartphone users have increased by a lot over the years currently the highest countries with users include China with over 850 million users, India with over 350 million users, and in third place The United States with about 260 million users as of 2019. While Android and iOS both dominate the smartphone market. A study By Gartner found that in 2016 about 88 of the worldwide smartphones were Android while iOS had a market share of about 12 . About 85 of the mobile market revenue came from mobile games.The impact of the digital revolution can also be assessed by exploring the amount of worldwide mobile smart device users there are. This can be split into 2 categories; smart phone users and smart tablet users. Worldwide there are currently 2.32 billion smartphone users across the world. This figure is to exceed 2.87 billion by 2020. Smart tablet users reached a total of 1 billion in 2015, 15 of the world's population.The statistics evidence the impact of digital media communications today. What is also of relevance is the fact that the number of smart device users is rising rapidly yet the amount of functional uses increase daily. A smartphone or tablet can be used for hundreds of daily needs. There are currently over 1 million apps on the Apple App store. These are all opportunities for digital marketing efforts. A smartphone user is impacted with digital advertising every second they open their Apple or Android device. This further evidences the digital revolution and the impact of revolution. This has resulted in a total of 13 billion dollars being paid out to the various app developers over the years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications. Most of these apps are able to generate income via in app advertising. Gross revenue for 2020 is projected to be about 189 million.  Disruption in industry  Compared with print media, the mass media, and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie making, the transition from analog film cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete. The transition has economic benefits to Hollywood, making distribution easier and making it possible to add high quality digital effects to films. At the same time, it has affected the analog special effects, stunt, and animation industries in Hollywood. It has imposed painful costs on small movie theaters, some of which did not or will not survive the transition to digital. The effect of digital media on other media industries is similarly sweeping and complex.Between 2000 and 2015, the print newspaper advertising revenue has fallen from 60 billion to a nearly 20 billion. Even one of the most popular days for papers, Sunday, has seen a 9 circulation decrease the lowest since 1945.In journalism, digital media and citizen journalism have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers. But the rise of digital journalism has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations. E books and self publishing are changing the book industry, and digital textbooks and other media inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education.In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, also called digital scholarship, making open access and open science possible thanks to the low cost of distribution. New fields of study have grown, such as digital humanities and digital history. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society. Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media. Often time the magazine or publisher have a Digital edition which can be referred to an electronic formatted version identical to the print version. There is a huge benefit to the publisher and cost, as half of traditional publishers' costs come from production, including raw materials, technical processing, and distribution. Since 2004, there has been a decrease in newspaper industry employment, with only about 40,000 people working in the workforce currently. Alliance of Audited Media Publishers information during the 2008 recession, over 10 of print sales are diminished for certain magazines, with a hardship coming from only 75 of the sales advertisements as before. However, in 2018, major newspapers advertising revenue was 35 from digital ads.In contrast, mobile versions of newspapers and magazines came in second with a huge growth of 135 . The New York Times has noted a 47 year of year rise in their digital subscriptions. 43 of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49 for television. Pew Research also asked respondents if they got news from a streaming device on their TV 9 of U.S. adults said that they do so often.  Individual as content creator  Digital media has also allowed individuals to be much more active in content creation. Anyone with access to computers and the Internet can participate in social media and contribute their own writing, art, videos, photography and commentary to the Internet, as well as conduct business online. The dramatic reduction in the costs required to create and share content have led to a democratization of content creation as well as the creation of new types of content, like blogs, memes, and video essays. Some of these activities have also been labelled citizen journalism. This spike in user created content is due to the development of the internet as well as the way in which users interact with media today. As more users join and use social media sites, the relevance of content creation increases. The release of technologies such mobile devices allow for easier and quicker access to all things media. Many media creation tools that were once available to only a few are now free and easy to use. The cost of devices that can access the Internet is steadily falling, and personal ownership of multiple digital devices is now becoming the standard. These elements have significantly affected political participation. Digital media is seen by many scholars as having a role in Arab Spring, and crackdowns on the use of digital and social media by embattled governments are increasingly common. Many governments restrict access to digital media in some way, either to prevent obscenity or in a broader form of political censorship.Over the years YouTube has grown to become a website with user generated media. This content is oftentimes not mediated by any company or agency, leading to a wide array of personalities and opinions online. Over the years, YouTube and other platforms have also shown their monetary gains. In 2020, the top 10 highest earning YouTube content creators each generated over 15 million dollars. Many of these YouTube profiles over the years have a multi camera set up as we would see on TV. Many of these creators also creating their own digital companies as their personalities grow. Personal devices have also seen an increase over the years. Over 1.5 billion users of tablets exist in this world right now and that is expected to slowly grow About 20 of people in the world regularly watch their content using tablets in 2018User generated content raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions. The spread of digital media, and the wide range of literacy and communications skills necessary to use it effectively, have deepened the digital divide between those who have access to digital media and those who don't.The rising of digital media has made the consumer's audio collection more precise and personalized. It is no longer necessary to purchase an entire album if the consumer is ultimately interested in only a few audio files.  Web only news  The rise of streaming services has led to a decrease of cable TV services to about 59 , while streaming services are growing at around 29 , and 9 are still users of the digital antenna. TV Controllers now incorporate designated buttons for streaming platforms. Users are spending an average of 1:55 with digital video each day, and only 1:44 on social networks. 6 out of 10 people report viewing their television shows and news via a streaming service. Platforms such as Netflix have gained attraction due to their adorability, accessibility, and for its original content. Companies such as Netflix have even bought previously cancelled shows such as Designated Survivor, Lucifer, and Arrested Development. As the internet becomes more and more prevalent, more companies are beginning to distribute content through internet only means. With the loss of viewers, there is a loss of revenue but not as bad as what would be expected.  Copyright challenges  Digital media encompasses numerical networks of interactive systems that link databases, allowing users to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another. Because of this ease, digital media poses several challenges to the current copyright and intellectual property laws. The ease of creating, modifying, and sharing digital media can influence copyright enforcement challenging and many copyright laws are widely seen as outdated. Under current copyright law, common Internet memes are generally illegal to share in many countries. Legal rights can be unclear for many common Internet activities. These include posting pictures from someone else's social media account, writing fanfiction, or covering and or using popular songs in content such as YouTube videos. During the last decade, the concepts of fair use and copyright have been applied to different types of online media. Copyright challenges are spreading to all parts of digital media. Content creators on platforms such as YouTube follow guidelines set by copyright, IP laws, and the platform's copyright requirements. If these guidelines are not followed, the content may get demonetized, deleted, or sued. The situation can also occur when creators accidentally use audio tracks or background scenes that are under copyright. To avoid or resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt open, or copyleft licenses or they can release their work to the public domain. By doing this, creators are giving up certain legal rights regarding their content. Fair use is a doctrine of the US Copyright Law that allows limited use of copyrighted materials without the need to obtain permission. There are four factors that make up fair use. The first, Purpose, refers to what the content is being used for. The second factor is what copyrighted content is being used. If the content is non fiction, it is more likely to fall under fair use than if the content is fiction. The third factor is how much of the copyrighted content is in use. Small amounts of copyrighted content are more likely to be considered fair. The last factor is, whether the use of copyrighted content earns money or affect the value of the content.Wikipedia uses some of the most common open licenses, Creative Commons licenses, and the GNU Free Documentation License. Open licenses are one aspect of a broad open content movement that advocates for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data, and other digital media. To facilitate the collection and consumption of such licensing information and availability status, tools like the Creative Commons Search engine are used mostly for web images, and Unpaywall, or used for scholarly communication. Additional software has been developed to restrict access to digital media. Digital rights management is used to lock material. This allows users to apply the media content to specific cases. DRM allows movie producers to rent at a lower price. This restricts the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized modification or sharing of media. Digital media copyright protection technologies fall under intellectual property protection technology. This is because a series of computer technologies protect the digital content being created and transmitted. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safety to intermediaries that host user content, such as YouTube, from being held liable for copyright infringement so long as they meet all required conditions. The most notable of which is the notice and take down policy. The policy requires online intermediaries to remove and or disable access to the content in question when there are court orders and or allegations of illegal use of the content on their site. As a result, YouTube has and continues to develop more policies and standards that go far past what the DMCA requires. YouTube has also created an algorithm which continuously scans their cite to make sure all content follows all policies.One digital media platform known to have copyright concerns is the short video sharing app TikTok. TikTok is a social media app that allows users to share short videos up to one minute in length, using a variety of visual effects and audio. According to Loyola University s Chicago School of Law, around 50 of the music used on TikTok is unlicensed. TikTok has several music licensing agreements with various artists and labels, creating a library of fair and legal use music. However, this does not cover all content for its users. A user could still commit a copyright violation on TikTok. One example is, accidentally having music playing on a stereo in the background or recording a laptop screen playing a song.Online magazines or digital magazines are one of the largest targets for copyright issues. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations report from March 2011, the definition of this medium is when a digital magazine involves the distribution of magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica. This definition can be considered outdated now that PDF replicas of print magazines are no longer common practice. These days digital magazines refer to magazines specifically created to be interactive digital platforms such as the internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad, or other devices. The barriers to digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. However, these platforms are also broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published; smartphones are an example. Thanks to the improvements in tablets and other personal electronic devices, digital magazines have become much more readable and enticing through the use of graphic art. The evolution of online magazines began to focus on becoming more of a social media and entertainment platform. Online piracy has become one of the larger issues that have occurred concerning digital media copyright. The piracy of digital media, such as film and television, directly impacts the copyright party . This action can impact the health of the digital media industry. Piracy directly breaks the laws and morals of copyright. Along with piracy, digital media has contributed to the ability to spread false information or fake news. Due to the widespread use of digital media, fake news can receive more notoriety. This notoriety enhances the negative effects fake news creates. As a result, people's health and well being can directly be affected.

            "text": "Digital television is the transmission of television signals using digital encoding, in contrast to the earlier analog television technology which used analog signals. At the time of its development it was considered an innovative advancement and represented the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Modern digital television is transmitted in high definition television with greater resolution than analog TV. It typically uses a widescreen aspect ratio in contrast to the narrower format of analog TV. It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit up to seven channels in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel, and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2000. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards: Digital Video Broadcasting uses coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation and supports hierarchical transmission. This standard has been adopted in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, for a total of approximately 60 countries. Advanced Television System Committee standard uses eight level vestigial sideband for terrestrial broadcasting. This standard has been adopted by 9 countries: the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Bahamas, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Suriname. Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting is a system designed to provide good reception to fixed receivers and also portable or mobile receivers. It utilizes OFDM and two dimensional interleaving. It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses MPEG 2 video and Advanced Audio Coding. This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines. ISDB T International is an adaptation of this standard using H.264 MPEG 4 AVC, which has been adopted in most of South America and Portuguese speaking African countries. Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast adopts time domain synchronous OFDM technology with a pseudo random signal frame to serve as the guard interval of the OFDM block and the training symbol. The DTMB standard has been adopted in China, including Hong Kong and Macau. Digital Multimedia Broadcasting is a digital radio transmission technology developed in South Korea as part of the national information technology project for sending multimedia such as TV, radio and datacasting to mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops and GPS navigation systems.  History   Background  Digital television's roots are tied to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility. Digital television was previously not practically feasible due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video, requiring around 200 Mbit s for a standard definition television signal, and over 1 Gbit s for high definition television .  Development  In the mid 1980s, Toshiba released a television set with digital capabilities, using integrated circuit chips such as a microprocessor to convert analog television broadcast signals to digital video signals, enabling features such as freezing pictures and showing two channels at once. In 1986, Sony and NEC Home Electronics announced their own similar TV sets with digital video capabilities. However, they still relied on analog TV broadcast signals, with true digital TV broadcasts not yet being available at the time.A digital TV broadcast service was proposed in 1986 by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication in Japan, where there were plans to develop an Integrated Network System service. However, it was not possible to practically implement such a digital TV service until the adoption of motion compensated DCT video compression formats such as MPEG made it possible in the early 1990s.In the mid 1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of HDTV technology, and as the MUSE analog format was proposed by Japan's public broadcaster NHK as a worldwide standard. Japanese advancements were seen as pacesetters that threatened to eclipse US electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard based on an analog system was the front runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Between 1988 and 1991, several European organizations were working on DCT based digital video coding standards for both SDTV and HDTV. The EU 256 project by the CMTT and ETSI, along with research by Italian broadcaster RAI, developed a DCT video codec that broadcast SDTV at 34 Mbit s and near studio quality HDTV at about 70 140 Mbit s. RAI demonstrated this with a 1990 FIFA World Cup broadcast in March 1990. An American company, General Instrument, also demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal in 1990. This led to the FCC being persuaded to delay its decision on an advanced television standard until a digitally based standard could be developed. In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new TV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images. Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being simulcast on different channels. The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.The final standard adopted by the FCC did not produce a universal standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry and the computer industry over which of the two scanning processes interlaced or progressive is superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even numbered lines first, then odd numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not flicker in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.  Inaugural launches  DirecTV in the US launched the first commercial digital satellite platform in May 1994, using the Digital Satellite System standard. Digital cable broadcasts were tested and launched in the US in 1996 by TCI and Time Warner. The first digital terrestrial platform was launched in November 1998 as ONdigital in the UK, using the DVB T standard.  Technical information   Formats and bandwidth  Digital television supports many different picture formats defined by the broadcast television systems which are a combination of size and aspect ratio . With digital terrestrial television broadcasting, the range of formats can be broadly divided into two categories: high definition television for the transmission of high definition video and standard definition television . These terms by themselves are not very precise, and many subtle intermediate cases exist. One of several different HDTV formats that can be transmitted over DTV is: 1280 720 pixels in progressive scan mode or 1920 1080 pixels in interlaced video mode . Each of these uses a 16:9 aspect ratio. HDTV cannot be transmitted over analog television channels because of channel capacity issues. SDTV, by comparison, may use one of several different formats taking the form of various aspect ratios depending on the technology used in the country of broadcast. NTSC can deliver a 640 480 resolution in 4:3 and 854 480 in 16:9, while PAL can give 768 576 in 4:3 and 1024 576 in 16:9. However, broadcasters may choose to reduce these resolutions to reduce bit rate .Each commercial broadcasting terrestrial television DTV channel in North America is permitted to be broadcast at a bit rate up to 19 megabits per second. However, the broadcaster does not need to use this entire bandwidth for just one broadcast channel. Instead the broadcast can use the channel to include PSIP and can also subdivide across several video subchannels of varying quality and compression rates, including non video datacasting services that allow one way high bit rate streaming of data to computers like National Datacast. A broadcaster may opt to use a standard definition digital signal instead of an HDTV signal, because current convention allows the bandwidth of a DTV channel to be subdivided into multiple digital subchannels, , providing multiple feeds of entirely different television programming on the same channel. This ability to provide either a single HDTV feed or multiple lower resolution feeds is often referred to as distributing one's bit budget or multicasting. This can sometimes be arranged automatically, using a statistical multiplexer . With some implementations, image resolution may be less directly limited by bandwidth; for example in DVB T, broadcasters can choose from several different modulation schemes, giving them the option to reduce the transmission bit rate and make reception easier for more distant or mobile viewers.  Reception  There are several different ways to receive digital television. One of the oldest means of receiving DTV is from terrestrial transmitters using an antenna . This way is known as Digital terrestrial television . With DTT, viewers are limited to channels that have a terrestrial transmitter in range of their antenna. Other ways have been devised to receive digital television. Among the most familiar to people are digital cable and digital satellite. In some countries where transmissions of TV signals are normally achieved by microwaves, digital MMDS is used. Other standards, such as Digital multimedia broadcasting and DVB H, have been devised to allow handheld devices such as mobile phones to receive TV signals. Another way is IPTV, that is receiving TV via Internet Protocol, relying on digital subscriber line or optical cable line. Finally, an alternative way is to receive digital TV signals via the open Internet , whether from a central streaming service or a P2P system. Some signals carry encryption and specify use conditions backed up with the force of law under the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and national legislation implementing it, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Access to encrypted channels can be controlled by a removable smart card, for example via the Common Interface standard for Europe and via Point Of Deployment for IS or named differently CableCard.  Protection parameters  Digital television signals must not interfere with each other, and they must also coexist with analog television until it is phased out. The following table gives allowable signal to noise and signal to interference ratios for various interference scenarios. This table is a crucial regulatory tool for controlling the placement and power levels of stations. Digital TV is more tolerant of interference than analog TV, and this is the reason a smaller range of channels can carry an all digital set of television stations.  Interaction  People can interact with a DTV system in various ways. One can, for example, browse the electronic program guide. Modern DTV systems sometimes use a return path providing feedback from the end user to the broadcaster. This is possible with a coaxial or fiber optic cable, a dialup modem, or Internet connection but is not possible with a standard antenna. Some of these systems support video on demand using a communication channel localized to a neighborhood rather than a city or an even larger area .  1seg  1seg is a special form of ISDB. Each channel is further divided into 13 segments. Twelve are allocated for HDTV and the other for narrow band receivers such as mobile televisions and cell phones.  Timeline of transition   Comparison to analog  DTV has several advantages over analog TV, the most significant being that digital channels take up less bandwidth, and the bandwidth needs are continuously variable, at a corresponding reduction in image quality depending on the level of compression as well as the resolution of the transmitted image. This means that digital broadcasters can provide more digital channels in the same space, provide high definition television service, or provide other non television services such as multimedia or interactivity. DTV also permits special services such as multiplexing , electronic program guides and additional languages . The sale of non television services may provide an additional revenue source. Digital and analog signals react to interference differently. For example, common problems with analog television include ghosting of images, noise from weak signals, and many other potential problems which degrade the quality of the image and sound, although the program material may still be watchable. With digital television, the audio and video must be synchronized digitally, so reception of the digital signal must be very nearly complete; otherwise, neither audio nor video will be usable. Short of this complete failure, blocky video is seen when the digital signal experiences interference. Analog TV began with monophonic sound, and later developed multichannel television sound with two independent audio signal channels. DTV allows up to 5 audio signal channels plus a subwoofer bass channel, with broadcasts similar in quality to movie theaters and DVDs.Digital TV signals require less transmission power than analog TV signals to be broadcast and received satisfactorily.  Compression artifacts, picture quality monitoring, and allocated bandwidth  DTV images have some picture defects that are not present on analog television or motion picture cinema, because of present day limitations of bit rate and compression algorithms such as MPEG 2. This defect is sometimes referred to as mosquito noise .Because of the way the human visual system works, defects in an image that are localized to particular features of the image or that come and go are more perceptible than defects that are uniform and constant. However, the DTV system is designed to take advantage of other limitations of the human visual system to help mask these flaws, e.g. by allowing more compression artifacts during fast motion where the eye cannot track and resolve them as easily and, conversely, minimizing artifacts in still backgrounds that may be closely examined in a scene . Broadcast, cable, satellite, and Internet DTV operators control the picture quality of television signal encodes using sophisticated, neuroscience based algorithms, such as the structural similarity video quality measurement tool, which was accorded each of its inventors a Primetime Emmy because of its global use. Another tool, called Visual Information Fidelity , is a top performing algorithm at the core of the Netflix VMAF video quality monitoring system, which accounts for about 35 of all US bandwidth consumption.  Effects of poor reception  Changes in signal reception from factors such as degrading antenna connections or changing weather conditions may gradually reduce the quality of analog TV. The nature of digital TV results in a perfectly decodable video initially, until the receiving equipment starts picking up interference that overpowers the desired signal or if the signal is too weak to decode. Some equipment will show a garbled picture with significant damage, while other devices may go directly from perfectly decodable video to no video at all or lock up. This phenomenon is known as the digital cliff effect. Block error may occur when transmission is done with compressed images. A block error in a single frame often results in black boxes in several subsequent frames, making viewing difficult. For remote locations, distant channels that, as analog signals, were previously usable in a snowy and degraded state may, as digital signals, be perfectly decodable or may become completely unavailable. The use of higher frequencies will add to these problems, especially in cases where a clear line of sight from the receiving antenna to the transmitter is not available, because usually higher frequency signals can't pass through obstacles as easily.  Effect on old analog technology  Television sets with only analog tuners cannot decode digital transmissions. When analog broadcasting over the air ceases, users of sets with analog only tuners may use other sources of programming or may purchase set top converter boxes to tune in the digital signals. In the United States, a government sponsored coupon was available to offset the cost of an external converter box. Analog switch off took place on December 11, 2006, in The Netherlands, June 12, 2009 in the United States for full power stations, and later for Class A Stations on September 1, 2016, July 24, 2011 in Japan, August 31, 2011 in Canada, February 13, 2012 in Arab states, May 1, 2012, in Germany, October 24, 2012, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, October 31, 2012 in selected Indian cities, and December 10, 2013, in Australia. Completion of analog switch off is scheduled for December 31, 2017 in the whole of India, December 2018 in Costa Rica and around 2020 for the Philippines.  Disappearance of TV audio receivers  Prior to the conversion to digital TV, analog television broadcast audio for TV channels on a separate FM carrier signal from the video signal. This FM audio signal could be heard using standard radios equipped with the appropriate tuning circuits. However, after the transition of many countries to digital TV, no portable radio manufacturer has yet developed an alternative method for portable radios to play just the audio signal of digital TV channels; DTV radio is not the same thing.  Environmental issues  The adoption of a broadcast standard incompatible with existing analog receivers has created the problem of large numbers of analog receivers being discarded during digital television transition. One superintendent of public works was quoted in 2009 saying; some of the studies I ve read in the trade magazines say up to a quarter of American households could be throwing a TV out in the next two years following the regulation change . In 2009, an estimated 99 million analog TV receivers were sitting unused in homes in the US alone and, while some obsolete receivers are being retrofitted with converters, many more are simply dumped in landfills where they represent a source of toxic metals such as lead as well as lesser amounts of materials such as barium, cadmium and chromium.According to one campaign group, a CRT computer monitor or TV contains an average of 8 pounds of lead. According to another source, the lead in glass of a CRT varies from 1.08 lb to 11.28 lb, depending on screen size and type, but the lead is in the form of stable and immobile lead oxide mixed into the glass. It is claimed that the lead can have long term negative effects on the environment if dumped as landfill. However, the glass envelope can be recycled at suitably equipped facilities. Other portions of the receiver may be subject to disposal as hazardous material. Local restrictions on disposal of these materials vary widely; in some cases second hand stores have refused to accept working color television receivers for resale due to the increasing costs of disposing of unsold TVs. Those thrift stores which are still accepting donated TVs have reported significant increases in good condition working used television receivers abandoned by viewers who often expect them not to work after digital transition.In Michigan in 2009, one recycler estimated that as many as one household in four would dispose of or recycle a TV set in the following year. The digital television transition, migration to high definition television receivers and the replacement of CRTs with flatscreens are all factors in the increasing number of discarded analog CRT based television receivers.

            "text": "A discrete cosine transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. The DCT, first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972, is a widely used transformation technique in signal processing and data compression. It is used in most digital media, including digital images , digital video , digital audio , digital television , digital radio , and speech coding . DCTs are also important to numerous other applications in science and engineering, such as digital signal processing, telecommunication devices, reducing network bandwidth usage, and spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions. In particular, a DCT is a Fourier related transform similar to the discrete Fourier transform , but using only real numbers. The DCTs are generally related to Fourier Series coefficients of a periodically and symmetrically extended sequence whereas DFTs are related to Fourier Series coefficients of only periodically extended sequences. DCTs are equivalent to DFTs of roughly twice the length, operating on real data with even symmetry , whereas in some variants the input and or output data are shifted by half a sample. There are eight standard DCT variants, of which four are common. The most common variant of discrete cosine transform is the type II DCT, which is often called simply the DCT . This was the original DCT as first proposed by Ahmed. Its inverse, the type III DCT, is correspondingly often called simply the inverse DCT or the IDCT . Two related transforms are the discrete sine transform , which is equivalent to a DFT of real and odd functions, and the modified discrete cosine transform , which is based on a DCT of overlapping data. Multidimensional DCTs are developed to extend the concept of DCT to MD signals. There are several algorithms to compute MD DCT. A variety of fast algorithms have been developed to reduce the computational complexity of implementing DCT. One of these is the integer DCT , an integer approximation of the standard DCT,: ix, xiii, 1, 141 304 used in several ISO IEC and ITU T international standards.DCT compression, also known as block compression, compresses data in sets of discrete DCT blocks. DCT blocks can have a number of sizes, including 8x8 pixels for the standard DCT, and varied integer DCT sizes between 4x4 and 32x32 pixels. The DCT has a strong energy compaction property, capable of achieving high quality at high data compression ratios. However, blocky compression artifacts can appear when heavy DCT compression is applied.  History The discrete cosine transform was first conceived by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao while working at Kansas State University, and he proposed the concept to the National Science Foundation in 1972. He originally intended DCT for image compression. Ahmed developed a practical DCT algorithm with his PhD student T. Raj Natarajan and friend Dr. K. R. Rao at the University of Texas at Arlington in 1973, and they found that it was the most efficient algorithm for image compression. They presented their results in a January 1974 paper, titled Discrete Cosine Transform. It described what is now called the type II DCT ,: 51 as well as the type III inverse DCT . It was a benchmark publication, and has been cited as a fundamental development in thousands of works since its publication. The basic research work and events that led to the development of the DCT were summarized in a later publication by Ahmed, How I Came Up with the Discrete Cosine Transform .Since its introduction in 1974, there has been significant research on the DCT. In 1977, Wen Hsiung Chen published a paper with C. Harrison Smith and Stanley C. Fralick presenting a fast DCT algorithm. Further developments include a 1978 paper by M.J. Narasimha and A.M. Peterson, and a 1984 paper by B.G. Lee. These research papers, along with the original 1974 Ahmed paper and the 1977 Chen paper, were cited by the Joint Photographic Experts Group as the basis for JPEG's lossy image compression algorithm in 1992.In 1975, John A. Roese and Guner S. Robinson adapted the DCT for inter frame motion compensated video coding. They experimented with the DCT and the fast Fourier transform , developing inter frame hybrid coders for both, and found that the DCT is the most efficient due to its reduced complexity, capable of compressing image data down to 0.25 bit per pixel for a videotelephone scene with image quality comparable to an intra frame coder requiring 2 bit per pixel. In 1979, Anil K. Jain and Jaswant R. Jain further developed motion compensated DCT video compression, also called block motion compensation. This led to Chen developing a practical video compression algorithm, called motion compensated DCT or adaptive scene coding, in 1981. Motion compensated DCT later became the standard coding technique for video compression from the late 1980s onwards.The integer DCT is used in Advanced Video Coding , introduced in 2003, and High Efficiency Video Coding , introduced in 2013. The integer DCT is also used in the High Efficiency Image Format , which uses a subset of the HEVC video coding format for coding still images.A DCT variant, the modified discrete cosine transform , was developed by John P. Princen, A.W. Johnson and Alan B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987, following earlier work by Princen and Bradley in 1986. The MDCT is used in most modern audio compression formats, such as Dolby Digital , MP3 , Advanced Audio Coding , and Vorbis .The discrete sine transform was derived from the DCT, by replacing the Neumann condition at x 0 with a Dirichlet condition.: 35 36 The DST was described in the 1974 DCT paper by Ahmed, Natarajan and Rao. A type I DST was later described by Anil K. Jain in 1976, and a type II DST was then described by H.B. Kekra and J.K. Solanka in 1978.Nasir Ahmed also developed a lossless DCT algorithm with Giridhar Mandyam and Neeraj Magotra at the University of New Mexico in 1995. This allows the DCT technique to be used for lossless compression of images. It is a modification of the original DCT algorithm, and incorporates elements of inverse DCT and delta modulation. It is a more effective lossless compression algorithm than entropy coding. Lossless DCT is also known as LDCT.  Applications The DCT is the most widely used transformation technique in signal processing, and by far the most widely used linear transform in data compression. Uncompressed digital media as well as lossless compression had impractically high memory and bandwidth requirements, which was significantly reduced by the highly efficient DCT lossy compression technique, capable of achieving data compression ratios from 8:1 to 14:1 for near studio quality, up to 100:1 for acceptable quality content. DCT compression standards are used in digital media technologies, such as digital images, digital photos, digital video, streaming media, digital television, streaming television, video on demand , digital cinema, high definition video , and high definition television .The DCT, and in particular the DCT II, is often used in signal and image processing, especially for lossy compression, because it has a strong energy compaction property: in typical applications, most of the signal information tends to be concentrated in a few low frequency components of the DCT. For strongly correlated Markov processes, the DCT can approach the compaction efficiency of the Karhunen Lo ve transform . As explained below, this stems from the boundary conditions implicit in the cosine functions. DCTs are also widely employed in solving partial differential equations by spectral methods, where the different variants of the DCT correspond to slightly different even odd boundary conditions at the two ends of the array. DCTs are also closely related to Chebyshev polynomials, and fast DCT algorithms are used in Chebyshev approximation of arbitrary functions by series of Chebyshev polynomials, for example in Clenshaw Curtis quadrature. The DCT is the coding standard for multimedia telecommunication devices. It is widely used for bit rate reduction, and reducing network bandwidth usage. DCT compression significantly reduces the amount of memory and bandwidth required for digital signals.  General applications  The DCT is widely used in many applications, which include the following.  DCT visual media standards  The DCT II, also known as simply the DCT, is the most important image compression technique. It is used in image compression standards such as JPEG, and video compression standards such as H.26x, MJPEG, MPEG, DV, Theora and Daala. There, the two dimensional DCT II of       N     N     displaystyle N times N  blocks are computed and the results are quantized and entropy coded. In this case,       N     displaystyle N  is typically 8 and the DCT II formula is applied to each row and column of the block. The result is an 8 8 transform coefficient array in which the            displaystyle  element is the DC component and entries with increasing vertical and horizontal index values represent higher vertical and horizontal spatial frequencies. Advanced Video Coding uses the integer DCT , an integer approximation of the DCT. It uses 4x4 and 8x8 integer DCT blocks. High Efficiency Video Coding and the High Efficiency Image Format use varied integer DCT block sizes between 4x4 and 32x32 pixels. As of 2019, AVC is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression and distribution of video content, used by 91 of video developers, followed by HEVC which is used by 43 of developers.  Image formats    Video formats   MDCT audio standards   General audio    Speech coding   MD DCT  Multidimensional DCTs have several applications, mainly 3 D DCTs such as the 3 D DCT II, which has several new applications like Hyperspectral Imaging coding systems, variable temporal length 3 D DCT coding, video coding algorithms, adaptive video coding and 3 D Compression. Due to enhancement in the hardware, software and introduction of several fast algorithms, the necessity of using M D DCTs is rapidly increasing. DCT IV has gained popularity for its applications in fast implementation of real valued polyphase filtering banks, lapped orthogonal transform and cosine modulated wavelet bases.  Digital signal processing  DCT plays a very important role in digital signal processing. By using the DCT, the signals can be compressed. DCT can be used in electrocardiography for the compression of ECG signals. DCT2 provides a better compression ratio than DCT. The DCT is widely implemented in digital signal processors , as well as digital signal processing software. Many companies have developed DSPs based on DCT technology. DCTs are widely used for applications such as encoding, decoding, video, audio, multiplexing, control signals, signaling, and analog to digital conversion. DCTs are also commonly used for high definition television encoder decoder chips.  Compression artifacts  A common issue with DCT compression in digital media are blocky compression artifacts, caused by DCT blocks. The DCT algorithm can cause block based artifacts when heavy compression is applied. Due to the DCT being used in the majority of digital image and video coding standards , DCT based blocky compression artifacts are widespread in digital media. In a DCT algorithm, an image is divided into square blocks which are processed independently from each other, then the DCT of these blocks is taken, and the resulting DCT coefficients are quantized. This process can cause blocking artifacts, primarily at high data compression ratios. This can also cause the mosquito noise effect, commonly found in digital video .DCT blocks are often used in glitch art. The artist Rosa Menkman makes use of DCT based compression artifacts in her glitch art, particularly the DCT blocks found in most digital media formats such as JPEG digital images and MP3 digital audio. Another example is Jpegs by German photographer Thomas Ruff, which uses intentional JPEG artifacts as the basis of the picture's style.  Informal overview Like any Fourier related transform, discrete cosine transforms express a function or a signal in terms of a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes. Like the discrete Fourier transform , a DCT operates on a function at a finite number of discrete data points. The obvious distinction between a DCT and a DFT is that the former uses only cosine functions, while the latter uses both cosines and sines . However, this visible difference is merely a consequence of a deeper distinction: a DCT implies different boundary conditions from the DFT or other related transforms. The Fourier related transforms that operate on a function over a finite domain, such as the DFT or DCT or a Fourier series, can be thought of as implicitly defining an extension of that function outside the domain. That is, once you write a function       f        displaystyle f  as a sum of sinusoids, you can evaluate that sum at any       x     displaystyle x , even for       x     displaystyle x  where the original       f        displaystyle f  was not specified. The DFT, like the Fourier series, implies a periodic extension of the original function. A DCT, like a cosine transform, implies an even extension of the original function. However, because DCTs operate on finite, discrete sequences, two issues arise that do not apply for the continuous cosine transform. First, one has to specify whether the function is even or odd at both the left and right boundaries of the domain . Second, one has to specify around what point the function is even or odd. In particular, consider a sequence abcd of four equally spaced data points, and say that we specify an even left boundary. There are two sensible possibilities: either the data are even about the sample a, in which case the even extension is dcbabcd, or the data are even about the point halfway between a and the previous point, in which case the even extension is dcbaabcd . These choices lead to all the standard variations of DCTs and also discrete sine transforms . Each boundary can be either even or odd and can be symmetric about a data point or the point halfway between two data points , for a total of 2 2 2 2 16 possibilities. Half of these possibilities, those where the left boundary is even, correspond to the 8 types of DCT; the other half are the 8 types of DST. These different boundary conditions strongly affect the applications of the transform and lead to uniquely useful properties for the various DCT types. Most directly, when using Fourier related transforms to solve partial differential equations by spectral methods, the boundary conditions are directly specified as a part of the problem being solved. Or, for the MDCT , the boundary conditions are intimately involved in the MDCT's critical property of time domain aliasing cancellation. In a more subtle fashion, the boundary conditions are responsible for the energy compactification properties that make DCTs useful for image and audio compression, because the boundaries affect the rate of convergence of any Fourier like series. In particular, it is well known that any discontinuities in a function reduce the rate of convergence of the Fourier series, so that more sinusoids are needed to represent the function with a given accuracy. The same principle governs the usefulness of the DFT and other transforms for signal compression; the smoother a function is, the fewer terms in its DFT or DCT are required to represent it accurately, and the more it can be compressed.  However, the implicit periodicity of the DFT means that discontinuities usually occur at the boundaries: any random segment of a signal is unlikely to have the same value at both the left and right boundaries.  In contrast, a DCT where both boundaries are even always yields a continuous extension at the boundaries . This is why DCTs, and in particular DCTs of types I, II, V, and VI generally perform better for signal compression than DFTs and DSTs. In practice, a type II DCT is usually preferred for such applications, in part for reasons of computational convenience.  Formal definition Formally, the discrete cosine transform is a linear, invertible function       f   :         R         N                R         N          displaystyle f: mathbb R N to mathbb R N  , or equivalently an invertible N N square matrix. There are several variants of the DCT with slightly modified definitions. The N real numbers            x      0        ,             x      N       1             displaystyle x 0 , ldots x N 1  are transformed into the N real numbers         X      0        ,       ,        X      N       1          displaystyle X 0 , , ldots , ,X N 1  according to one of the formulas:  DCT I          X      k                1    2              k          x      N       1                      n       1         N       2          x      n        cos                                       N          1                       n       k                   for        k     0   ,          N     1     .     displaystyle X k frac 1 2  k x N 1 sum n 1 N 2 x n cos left , frac pi ,N 1 , ,n ,k , right qquad text for k 0, ldots N 1 . Some authors further multiply the         x      0          displaystyle x 0  and         x      N       1          displaystyle x N 1  terms by             2             ,     displaystyle sqrt 2 , ,,  and correspondingly multiply the         X      0          displaystyle X 0  and         X      N       1          displaystyle X N 1  terms by       1                2             ,     displaystyle 1 sqrt 2 , ,,  which makes the DCT I matrix orthogonal, if one further multiplies by an overall scale factor of                         2          N           1                                ,     displaystyle sqrt tfrac 2 N 1 , , ,  but breaks the direct correspondence with a real even DFT. The DCT I is exactly equivalent , to a DFT of       2        displaystyle 2  real numbers with even symmetry. For example, a DCT I of       N     5     displaystyle N 5  real numbers       a     b     c     d     e     displaystyle a b c d e  is exactly equivalent to a DFT of eight real numbers       a     b     c     d     e     d     c     b     displaystyle a b c d e d c b  , divided by two. Note, however, that the DCT I is not defined for       N     displaystyle N  less than 2, while all other DCT types are defined for any positive       N   .     displaystyle N.  Thus, the DCT I corresponds to the boundary conditions:         x      n          displaystyle x n  is even around       n     0     displaystyle n 0  and even around       n     N     1     displaystyle n N 1 ; similarly for         X      k        .     displaystyle X k .   DCT II          X      k                   n       0         N       1          x      n        cos                                                        N                         k                   for        k     0   ,          N     1     .     displaystyle X k sum n 0 N 1 x n cos left , tfrac , pi , N left k , right qquad text for k 0, dots N 1 . The DCT II is probably the most commonly used form, and is often simply referred to as the DCT .This transform is exactly equivalent to a DFT of       4   N     displaystyle 4N  real inputs of even symmetry where the even indexed elements are zero. That is, it is half of the DFT of the       4   N     displaystyle 4N  inputs         y      n        ,     displaystyle y n ,  where         y      2    n          0   ,     displaystyle y 2n 0,          y      2    n       1             x      n          displaystyle y 2n 1 x n  for       0     n     N   ,     displaystyle 0 leq n N,          y      2    N          0   ,     displaystyle y 2N 0,  and         y      4    N       n             y      n          displaystyle y 4N n y n  for       0     n     2   N   .     displaystyle 0 n 2N.  DCT II transformation is also possible using 2N signal followed by a multiplication by half shift. This is demonstrated by Makhoul. Some authors further multiply the         X      0          displaystyle X 0  term by       1                N                displaystyle 1 sqrt N , ,  and multiply the resulting matrix by an overall scale factor of                2                     N             textstyle sqrt 2 N   . This makes the DCT II matrix orthogonal, but breaks the direct correspondence with a real even DFT of half shifted input. This is the normalization used by Matlab, for example, see. In many applications, such as JPEG, the scaling is arbitrary because scale factors can be combined with a subsequent computational step , and a scaling can be chosen that allows the DCT to be computed with fewer multiplications.The DCT II implies the boundary conditions:         x      n          displaystyle x n  is even around       n        1          2     displaystyle n 1 2  and even around       n     N     1          2     ;     displaystyle n N 1 2 ,;          X      k          displaystyle X k  is even around       k     0     displaystyle k 0  and odd around       k     N   .     displaystyle k N.   DCT III          X      k             1               2        x      0                   n       1         N       1          x      n        cos                                                        N                         n                   for        k     0   ,          N     1     .     displaystyle X k 1 2 x 0 sum n 1 N 1 x n cos left , tfrac , pi , N left n , right qquad text for k 0, dots N 1 . Because it is the inverse of DCT II , this form is sometimes simply referred to as the inverse DCT .Some authors divide the            x      0             displaystyle x 0  term by             2             displaystyle sqrt 2 ,  instead of by 2 and multiply the resulting matrix by an overall scale factor of                2                     N                 textstyle sqrt 2 N ,  , so that the DCT II and DCT III are transposes of one another. This makes the DCT III matrix orthogonal, but breaks the direct correspondence with a real even DFT of half shifted output. The DCT III implies the boundary conditions:         x      n          displaystyle x n  is even around       n     0     displaystyle n 0  and odd around       n     N   ;     displaystyle n N;          X      k          displaystyle X k  is even around       k          1               2       displaystyle k 1 2  and even around       k     N        1               2     .     displaystyle k N 1 2 .   DCT IV          X      k                   n       0         N       1          x      n        cos                                                        N                                                       for        k     0   ,          N     1     .     displaystyle X k sum n 0 N 1 x n cos left , tfrac , pi , N , left left , right qquad text for k 0, ldots N 1 . The DCT IV matrix becomes orthogonal if one further multiplies by an overall scale factor of             2              N           .     textstyle sqrt 2 N , .  A variant of the DCT IV, where data from different transforms are overlapped, is called the modified discrete cosine transform .The DCT IV implies the boundary conditions:         x      n          displaystyle x n  is even around       n          1               2       displaystyle n 1 2  and odd around       n     N        1               2     ;     displaystyle n N 1 2 ;  similarly for         X      k        .     displaystyle X k .   DCT V VIII  DCTs of types I IV treat both boundaries consistently regarding the point of symmetry: they are even odd around either a data point for both boundaries or halfway between two data points for both boundaries. By contrast, DCTs of types V VIII imply boundaries that are even odd around a data point for one boundary and halfway between two data points for the other boundary. In other words, DCT types I IV are equivalent to real even DFTs of even order , since the corresponding DFT is of length       2        displaystyle 2  or       4   N     displaystyle 4N  or       8   N     displaystyle 8N  . The four additional types of discrete cosine transform correspond essentially to real even DFTs of logically odd order, which have factors of       N        1               2       displaystyle N pm 1 2  in the denominators of the cosine arguments. However, these variants seem to be rarely used in practice. One reason, perhaps, is that FFT algorithms for odd length DFTs are generally more complicated than FFT algorithms for even length DFTs , and this increased intricacy carries over to the DCTs as described below. of a single number a , corresponds to a DCT V of length       N     1.     displaystyle N 1.   Inverse transforms Using the normalization conventions above, the inverse of DCT I is DCT I multiplied by 2 . The inverse of DCT IV is DCT IV multiplied by 2 N. The inverse of DCT II is DCT III multiplied by 2 N and vice versa.Like for the DFT, the normalization factor in front of these transform definitions is merely a convention and differs between treatments. For example, some authors multiply the transforms by             2              N          textstyle sqrt 2 N  so that the inverse does not require any additional multiplicative factor. Combined with appropriate factors of 2 , this can be used to make the transform matrix orthogonal.  Multidimensional DCTs Multidimensional variants of the various DCT types follow straightforwardly from the one dimensional definitions: they are simply a separable product of DCTs along each dimension.  M D DCT II  For example, a two dimensional DCT II of an image or a matrix is simply the one dimensional DCT II, from above, performed along the rows and then along the columns . That is, the 2D DCT II is given by the formula :                         X                k            1                 ,           k            2                                                              n            1                      0                     N            1                      1                                      k              2                                                 cos                                                 N              1                                                    k            1                                                                             n            1                      0                     N            1                      1                                  n            2                      0                     N            2                      1                  x                n            1                 ,           n            2                         cos                                                 N              1                                                    k            1                              cos                                                 N              2                                                    k            2                              .                 displaystyle begin aligned X k 1 ,k 2  sum n 1 0 N 1 1 left k 2 right right cos left frac pi N 1 left k 1 right  sum n 1 0 N 1 1 sum n 2 0 N 2 1 x n 1 ,n 2 cos left frac pi N 1 left k 1 right cos left frac pi N 2 left k 2 right . end aligned  The inverse of a multi dimensional DCT is just a separable product of the inverses of the corresponding one dimensional DCTs , e.g. the one dimensional inverses applied along one dimension at a time in a row column algorithm.The 3 D DCT II is only the extension of 2 D DCT II in three dimensional space and mathematically can be calculated by the formula         X          k        1           ,       k        2           ,       k        3                              n        1              0             N        1              1                    n        2              0             N        2              1                    n        3              0             N        3              1          x          n        1           ,       n        2           ,       n        3               cos                               N          1                                  k        1                  cos                               N          2                                  k        2                  cos                               N          3                                  k        3                  ,        for        k      i          0   ,   1   ,   2   ,     ,     N      i          1.     displaystyle X k 1 ,k 2 ,k 3 sum n 1 0 N 1 1 sum n 2 0 N 2 1 sum n 3 0 N 3 1 x n 1 ,n 2 ,n 3 cos left frac pi N 1 left k 1 right cos left frac pi N 2 left k 2 right cos left frac pi N 3 left k 3 right , quad text for k i 0,1,2, dots ,N i 1.

Technically, computing a two , three dimensional DCT by sequences of one dimensional DCTs along each dimension is known as a row column algorithm. As with multidimensional FFT algorithms, however, there exist other methods to compute the same thing while performing the computations in a different order . Owing to the rapid growth in the applications based on the 3 D DCT, several fast algorithms are developed for the computation of 3 D DCT II. Vector Radix algorithms are applied for computing M D DCT to reduce the computational complexity and to increase the computational speed. To compute 3 D DCT II efficiently, a fast algorithm, Vector Radix Decimation in Frequency algorithm was developed.  3 D DCT II VR DIF  In order to apply the VR DIF algorithm the input data is to be formulated and rearranged as follows.

The conventional method to calculate MD DCT II is using a Row Column Frame approach which is computationally complex and less productive on most advanced recent hardware platforms. The number of multiplications required to compute VR DIF Algorithm when compared to RCF algorithm are quite a few in number. The number of Multiplications and additions involved in RCF approach are given by                          3     2              N        3              log        2              N                displaystyle left frac 3 2 N 3 log 2 N right  and                          9     2              N        3              log        2              N       3       N        3              3       N        2                    ,     displaystyle left frac 9 2 N 3 log 2 N 3N 3 3N 2 right ,  respectively. From Table 1, it can be seen that the total number of multiplications associated with the 3 D DCT VR algorithm is less than that associated with the RCF approach by more than 40 . In addition, the RCF approach involves matrix transpose and more indexing and data swapping than the new VR algorithm. This makes the 3 D DCT VR algorithm more efficient and better suited for 3 D applications that involve the 3 D DCT II such as video compression and other 3 D image processing applications. The main consideration in choosing a fast algorithm is to avoid computational and structural complexities. As the technology of computers and DSPs advances, the execution time of arithmetic operations is becoming very fast, and regular computational structure becomes the most important factor. Therefore, although the above proposed 3 D VR algorithm does not achieve the theoretical lower bound on the number of multiplications, it has a simpler computational structure as compared to other 3 D DCT algorithms. It can be implemented in place using a single butterfly and possesses the properties of the Cooley Tukey FFT algorithm in 3 D. Hence, the 3 D VR presents a good choice for reducing arithmetic operations in the calculation of the 3 D DCT II, while keeping the simple structure that characterize butterfly style Cooley Tukey FFT algorithms. The image to the right shows a combination of horizontal and vertical frequencies for an 8 8            displaystyle  two dimensional DCT. Each step from left to right and top to bottom is an increase in frequency by 1 2 cycle. For example, moving right one from the top left square yields a half cycle increase in the horizontal frequency. Another move to the right yields two half cycles. A move down yields two half cycles horizontally and a half cycle vertically. The source data is transformed to a linear combination of these 64 frequency squares.  MD DCT IV  The M D DCT IV is just an extension of 1 D DCT IV on to M dimensional domain. The 2 D DCT IV of a matrix or an image is given by         X      k    ,                       n       0         N       1                   m       0         M       1             x      n    ,    m        cos                                         4     N                         cos                                         4     M                            ,     displaystyle X k, ell sum n 0 N 1 ; sum m 0 M 1 x n,m cos left  pi , 4N  right cos left  pi , 4M  right , for            k     0   ,     1   ,     2          N     1          displaystyle k 0, 1, 2 ldots N 1  and                 0   ,     1   ,     2   ,          M     1     .     displaystyle ell 0, 1, 2, ldots M 1 . We can compute the MD DCT IV using the regular row column method or we can use the polynomial transform method for the fast and efficient computation. The main idea of this algorithm is to use the Polynomial Transform to convert the multidimensional DCT into a series of 1 D DCTs directly. MD DCT IV also has several applications in various fields.  Computation Although the direct application of these formulas would require               O               displaystyle mathcal O   operations, it is possible to compute the same thing with only               O               displaystyle mathcal O   complexity by factorizing the computation similarly to the fast Fourier transform . One can also compute DCTs via FFTs combined with               O               displaystyle mathcal O   pre and post processing steps. In general,               O               displaystyle mathcal O   methods to compute DCTs are known as fast cosine transform algorithms. The most efficient algorithms, in principle, are usually those that are specialized directly for the DCT, as opposed to using an ordinary FFT plus               O               displaystyle mathcal O   extra operations . However, even specialized DCT algorithms are typically closely related to FFT algorithms since DCTs are essentially DFTs of real even data, one can design a fast DCT algorithm by taking an FFT and eliminating the redundant operations due to this symmetry. This can even be done automatically . Algorithms based on the Cooley Tukey FFT algorithm are most common, but any other FFT algorithm is also applicable. For example, the Winograd FFT algorithm leads to minimal multiplication algorithms for the DFT, albeit generally at the cost of more additions, and a similar algorithm was proposed by for the DCT. Because the algorithms for DFTs, DCTs, and similar transforms are all so closely related, any improvement in algorithms for one transform will theoretically lead to immediate gains for the other transforms as well . While DCT algorithms that employ an unmodified FFT often have some theoretical overhead compared to the best specialized DCT algorithms, the former also have a distinct advantage: Highly optimized FFT programs are widely available. Thus, in practice, it is often easier to obtain high performance for general lengths N with FFT based algorithms. Specialized DCT algorithms, on the other hand, see widespread use for transforms of small, fixed sizes such as the 8 8 DCT II used in JPEG compression, or the small DCTs typically used in audio compression. In fact, even the DCT algorithms using an ordinary FFT are sometimes equivalent to pruning the redundant operations from a larger FFT of real symmetric data, and they can even be optimal from the perspective of arithmetic counts. For example, a type II DCT is equivalent to a DFT of size         4   N        displaystyle 4N  with real even symmetry whose even indexed elements are zero. One of the most common methods for computing this via an FFT was described by Narasimha Peterson and Makhoul , and this method in hindsight can be seen as one step of a radix 4 decimation in time Cooley Tukey algorithm applied to the logical real even DFT corresponding to the DCT II. Because the even indexed elements are zero, this radix 4 step is exactly the same as a split radix step. If the subsequent size         N        displaystyle N  real data FFT is also performed by a real data split radix algorithm , then the resulting algorithm actually matches what was long the lowest published arithmetic count for the power of two DCT II . A recent reduction in the operation count to                   17    9           N     log      2          N           O             displaystyle tfrac 17 9 N log 2 N mathcal O  also uses a real data FFT. So, there is nothing intrinsically bad about computing the DCT via an FFT from an arithmetic perspective it is sometimes merely a question of whether the corresponding FFT algorithm is optimal.  Example of IDCT  Consider this 8x8 grayscale image of capital letter A. Each basis function is multiplied by its coefficient and then this product is added to the final image.

            "text": "Donald Watts Davies, was a Welsh computer scientist who was employed at the UK National Physical Laboratory .In 1965 he conceived of packet switching, which is today the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide. Davies proposed a commercial national network in the United Kingdom and designed and built the local area NPL network to demonstrate the technology. Many of the wide area packet switched networks built in the 1970s were similar in nearly all respects to his original 1965 design. The ARPANET project credited Davies for his influence, which was key to the development of the Internet.Davies' work was independent of the work of Paul Baran in the United States who had a similar idea in the early 1960s, and who also worked on ARPANET.  Early life Davies was born in Treorchy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales. His father, a clerk at a coalmine, died a few months later, and his mother took Donald and his twin sister back to her home town of Portsmouth, where he went to school. He attended the Southern Grammar School for Boys. He received a BSc degree in physics at Imperial College London, and then joined the war effort working as an assistant to Klaus Fuchs on the nuclear weapons Tube Alloys project at Birmingham University. He then returned to Imperial taking a first class degree in mathematics ; he was also awarded the Lubbock memorial Prize as the outstanding mathematician of his year. In 1955, he married Diane Burton; they had a daughter and two sons.  Career history   National Physical Laboratory  From 1947, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where Alan Turing was designing the Automatic Computing Engine computer. It is said that Davies spotted mistakes in Turing's seminal 1936 paper On Computable Numbers, much to Turing's annoyance. These were perhaps some of the first programming bugs in existence, even if they were for a theoretical computer, the universal Turing machine. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing's departure. Davies took over the project and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious Pilot ACE computer, which first worked in May 1950. A commercial spin off, DEUCE was manufactured by English Electric Computers and became one of the best selling machines of the 1950s.Davies also worked on applications of traffic simulation and machine translation. In the early 1960s, he worked on government technology initiatives designed to stimulate the British computer industry.  Packet switching  In 1965, Davies developed the idea of packet switching, dividing computer messages into packets that are routed independently across a network, possibly via differing routes, and are reassembled at the destination. Davies used the word packets after consulting with a linguist because it was capable of being translated into languages other than English without compromise. Davies' key insight came in the realisation that computer network traffic was inherently bursty with periods of silence, compared with relatively constant telephone traffic. He designed and proposed a commercial national data network based on packet switching in his 1966 Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On line Data Processing.In 1966 he returned to the NPL at Teddington just outside London, where he headed and transformed its computing activity. He became interested in data communications following a visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he saw that a significant problem with the new time sharing computer systems was the cost of keeping a phone connection open for each user. Davies was the first to describe the concept of an Interface computer , in 1966, today known as a router. He and his team were one of the first to use the term 'protocol' in a data commutation context in 1967. The NPL team also carried out simulation work on packet networks, including datagram networks.His work on packet switching, presented by his colleague Roger Scantlebury, initially caught the attention of the developers of ARPANET, a US defence network, at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. In Scantlebury's report following the conference, he noted It would appear that the ideas in the NPL paper at the moment are more advanced than any proposed in the USA . Larry Roberts of the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States applied Davies' concepts of packet switching in the late 1960s for the ARPANET, which went on to become a predecessor to the Internet. These early years of computer resource sharing were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing. Davies first presented his own ideas on packet switching at a conference in Edinburgh on 5 August 1968. At NPL Davies helped build a packet switched network . It was replaced with the Mark II in 1973, and remained in operation until 1986, influencing other research in the UK and Europe, including Louis Pouzin's CYCLADES project in France. Unbeknown to him, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation in the United States was also working on a similar concept; when Baran became aware of Davies's work he acknowledged that they both had equally discovered the concept. Baran was happy to acknowledge that Davies had come up with the same idea as him independently. In an e mail to Davies, he wrote You and I share a common view of what packet switching is all about, since you and I independently came up with the same ingredients. Leonard Kleinrock, a contemporary working on analysing message flow using queueing theory, developed a theoretical basis for the operation of message switching networks in his PhD thesis during 1961 2, published as a book in 1964. However, Kleinrock's later claim to have developed the theoretical basis of packet switching networks is disputed, including by Robert Taylor, Baran and Davies. Davies and Baran are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.  Internetworking  Davies, along with his deputy Derek Barber and Roger Scantlebury, conducted research into protocols for internetworking. They participated in the International Networking Working Group from 1972, initially chaired by Vint Cerf and later Derek Barber. Davies and Scantlebury were acknowledged by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf in their 1974 paper on internetworking, A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication .Davies and Barber published Communication networks for computers in 1973. They spoke at the Data Communications Symposium in 1975 about the battle for access standards between datagrams and virtual circuits, with Barber saying the lack of standard access interfaces for emerging public packet switched communication networks is creating 'some kind of monster' for users . For a long period of time, the network engineering community was polarized over the implementation of competing protocol suites, a debate commonly called the 'Protocol Wars'. It was unclear which type of protocol would result in the best and most robust computer networks. Internetworking experiments at NPL under Davies included connecting with the European Informatics Network by translating between two different host protocols and connecting with the Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service using a common host protocol in both networks. Their research confirmed establishing a common host protocol would be more reliable and efficient than translating between different host protocols using a gateway. Davies and Barber published Computer networks and their protocols in 1979.  Computer network security  Davies relinquished his management responsibilities in 1979 to return to research. He became particularly interested in computer network security. Together with David O. Clayden, he designed the Message Authenticator Algorithm in 1983, one of the first message authentication code algorithms to gain widespread acceptance. It was adopted as international standard ISO 8731 2 in 1987. He retired from NPL in 1984, becoming a leading consultant on data security to the banking industry and publishing a book on the topic that year.  Later career  In 1987, Davies became a visiting professor at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College.  Awards and honours Davies was appointed a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1975 and was made a CBE in 1983, and later a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1987.He received the John Player Award from the BCS in 1974. and was awarded a medal by the John von Neumann Computer Society in Hungary in 1985.In 2000, Davies shared the inaugural IEEE Internet Award. In 2007, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and in 2012 Davies was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.NPL sponsors a gallery, opened in 2009, about the development of packet switching and Technology of the Internet at The National Museum of Computing.A blue plaque commemorating Davies was unveiled in Treorchy in July 2013.  Family Davies was survived by his wife Diane, a daughter and two sons.

            "text": "The Eastern Orthodox Church, also called the Orthodox Church, is the second largest Christian church, with approximately 220 million baptized members. It operates as a communion of autocephalous churches, each governed by its bishops via local synods. The church has no central doctrinal or governmental authority analogous to the head of the Roman Catholic Church the Pope but the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is recognized by them as primus inter pares which is can be explained as representative of the church. As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe. The Eastern Orthodox Church officially calls itself the Orthodox Catholic Church.Eastern Orthodox theology is based on holy tradition, which incorporates the dogmatic decrees of the seven ecumenical councils, the Scriptures, and the teaching of the Church Fathers. The church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, and that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles. It maintains that it practices the original Christian faith, as passed down by holy tradition. Its patriarchates, reminiscent of the pentarchy, and other autocephalous and autonomous churches, reflect a variety of hierarchical organisation. It recognizes seven major sacraments, of which the Eucharist is the principal one, celebrated liturgically in synaxis. The church teaches that through consecration invoked by a priest, the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The Virgin Mary is venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the God bearer, honored in devotions. The churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch except for some breaks of communion such as the Photian schism or the Acacian schism shared communion with the Church of Rome until the East West Schism in 1054. The 1054 schism was the culmination of mounting theological, political, and cultural disputes, particularly over the authority of the pope, between those churches. Before the Council of Ephesus in AD 431, the Church of the East also shared in this communion, as did the various Oriental Orthodox Churches before the Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, all separating primarily over differences in Christology. The majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians live mainly in Southeast and Eastern Europe, Siberia, and the Russian Far East. Roughly half of Eastern Orthodox Christians live in the post Soviet states, mostly Russia. There are also communities in the former Byzantine regions of Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and in the Middle East, which are decreasing due to forced migration driven by increased religious persecution. Eastern Orthodox communities are also present in many other parts of the world, particularly North America, Western Europe, and Australia, formed through diaspora, conversions, and missionary activity.  Name and characteristics   Definition  The Eastern Orthodox Church is defined as the Eastern Christians which recognize the seven ecumenical councils and usually are in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the Patriarchate of Alexandria, the Patriarchate of Antioch, and the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Eastern Orthodox churches are defined positively by their adherence to the dogmatic definitions of the seven ecumenical councils, by the strong sense of not being a sect or a denomination but simply continuing the Christian church, and, despite their varied origins, by adherence to the Byzantine rite. Those churches are negatively defined by their rejection of papal immediate and universal supremacy. The seven ecumenical councils recognized by the Eastern Orthodox churches are: Nicaea I, Constantinople I, Ephesus, Chalcedon, Constantinople II, Constantinople III, and Nicaea II. Those churches consider the Quinisext Council shar es the ecumenical authority of Constantinople III. By an agreement that appears to be in place in the Eastern Orthodox world, possibly the council held in 879 to vindicate the Patriarch Photius will at some future date be recognized as the eighth ecumenical council by the Eastern Orthodox Church.Western Rite Orthodoxy exists both outside and inside Eastern Orthodoxy. Within Eastern Orthodoxy, it is practised by a vicariate of the Antiochian Orthodox church.  Name  In keeping with the church's teaching on universality and with the Nicene Creed, Eastern Orthodox authorities such as Raphael of Brooklyn have insisted that the full name of the church has always included the term Catholic , as in Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Church .The official name of the Eastern Orthodox Church is the Orthodox Catholic Church . It is the name by which the church refers to itself and which is issued in its liturgical or canonical texts. Eastern Orthodox theologians refer to the church as catholic. This name and longer variants containing Catholic are also recognized and referenced in other books and publications by secular or non Eastern Orthodox writers. The catechism of Philaret of Moscow published in the 19th century is titled: The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church . The common name of the church, Eastern Orthodox Church , is a shortened practicality that helps to avoid confusions in casual use. From ancient times through the first millennium, Greek was the most prevalent shared language in the demographic regions where the Byzantine Empire flourished, and Greek, being the language in which the New Testament was written, was the primary liturgical language of the church. For this reason, the eastern churches were sometimes identified as Greek , even before the Great Schism of 1054. After 1054, Greek Orthodox or Greek Catholic marked a church as being in communion with Constantinople, much as Catholic did for communion with the Catholic Church. In Hungarian, the church is still commonly called Eastern Greek . This identification with Greek, however, became increasingly confusing with time. Missionaries brought Eastern Orthodoxy to many regions without ethnic Greeks, where the Greek language was not spoken. In addition, struggles between Rome and Constantinople to control parts of Southeastern Europe resulted in the conversion of some churches to the Catholic Church, which then also used Greek Catholic to indicate their continued use of the Byzantine rites. Today, many of those same churches remain, while a very large number of Eastern Orthodox are not of Greek national origin, and do not use Greek as the language of worship. Eastern , then, indicates the geographical element in the church's origin and development, while Orthodox indicates the faith, as well as communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. There are additional Christian churches in the east that are in communion with neither the Catholic Church nor the Eastern Orthodox Church, who tend to be distinguished by the category named Oriental Orthodox . While the Eastern Orthodox Church continues officially to call itself Catholic , for reasons of universality, the common title of Eastern Orthodox Church avoids casual confusion with the Roman Catholic Church.  Orthodoxy  The first known use of the phrase the catholic Church occurred in a letter written about 110 AD from one Greek church to another . The letter states: Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal katholike Church. Thus, almost from the beginning, Christians referred to the Christian Church as the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church . The Eastern Orthodox Church claims that it is today the continuation and preservation of that same early church. A number of other Christian churches also make a similar claim: the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Assyrian Church and the Oriental Orthodox. In the Eastern Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox Church in the years following the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon , respectively, in their refusal to accept those councils' Christological definitions. Similarly, the churches in Rome and Constantinople separated in an event known as the East West Schism, traditionally dated to the year 1054, although it was more a gradual process than a sudden break. To all these churches, the claim to catholicity is important for multiple doctrinal reasons that have more bearing internally in each church than in their relation to the others, now separated in faith. The meaning of holding to a faith that is true is the primary reason why anyone's statement of which church split off from which other has any significance at all; the issues go as deep as the schisms. The depth of this meaning in the Eastern Orthodox Church is registered first in its use of the word Orthodox itself, a union of Greek orthos and doxa .The dual meanings of doxa, with glory or glorification , especially in worship, yield the pair correct belief and true worship . Together, these express the core of a fundamental teaching about the inseparability of belief and worship and their role in drawing the church together with Christ. The Bulgarian and all the Slavic churches use the title Pravoslavie , meaning correctness of glorification , to denote what is in English Orthodoxy, while the Georgians use the title Martlmadidebeli. The term Eastern Church has been used to distinguish it from western Christendom . Eastern is used to indicate that the highest concentrations of the Eastern Orthodox Church presence remain in the eastern part of the Christian world, although it is growing worldwide. Orthodox Christians throughout the world use various ethnic or national jurisdictional titles, or more inclusively, the title Eastern Orthodox , Orthodox Catholic , or simply Orthodox .What unites Orthodox Christians is the catholic faith as carried through holy tradition. That faith is expressed most fundamentally in scripture and worship, and the latter most essentially through baptism and in the Divine Liturgy.The lines of even this test can blur, however, when differences that arise are not due to doctrine, but to recognition of jurisdiction. As the Eastern Orthodox Church has spread into the west and over the world, the church as a whole has yet to sort out all the inter jurisdictional issues that have arisen in the expansion, leaving some areas of doubt about what is proper church governance. Moreover, as in the ancient church persecutions, the aftermath of persecutions of Christians in communist nations has left behind some issues of governance and lapse piety that have yet to be completely resolved.All members of the Eastern Orthodox Church profess the same faith, regardless of race or nationality, jurisdiction or local custom, or century of birth. Holy tradition encompasses the understandings and means by which that unity of faith is transmitted across boundaries of time, geography, and culture. It is a continuity that exists only inasmuch as it lives within Christians themselves. It is not static, nor an observation of rules, but rather a sharing of observations that spring both from within and also in keeping with others, even others who lived lives long past. The church proclaims the Holy Spirit maintains the unity and consistency of holy tradition to preserve the integrity of the faith within the church, as given in the scriptural promises.The shared beliefs of Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within holy tradition and cannot be separated from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone. Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed. Doctrine must also be lived in order to be prayed, for without action, the prayer is idle and empty, a mere vanity, and therefore the theology of demons.  Catholicity  The Eastern Orthodox Church considers itself to be both orthodox and catholic. The doctrine of the Catholicity of the Church, as derived from the Nicene Creed, is essential to Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology. The term Catholicity of the Church is used in its original sense, as a designation for the universality of the Christian Church, centered around Christ. Therefore, the Eastern Orthodox notion of catholicity is not centered around any singular see, unlike the Catholic Church which has one earthly center. Due to the influence of the Catholic Church in the west, where the English language itself developed, the words catholic and catholicity are sometimes used to refer to that church specifically. However, the more prominent dictionary sense given for general use is still the one shared by other languages, implying breadth and universality, reflecting comprehensive scope. In a Christian context, the Christian Church, as identified with the original church founded by Christ and his apostles, is said to be catholic in regard to its union with Christ in faith. Just as Christ is indivisible, so are union with him and faith in him, whereby the Christian Church is universal , unseparated, and comprehensive, including all who share that faith. Orthodox bishop Kallistos Ware has called that simple Christianity . That is the sense of early and patristic usage wherein the church usually refers to itself as the Catholic Church , whose faith is the Orthodox faith . It is also the sense within the phrase one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church , found in the Nicene Creed, and referred to in Orthodox worship, e.g. in the litany of the catechumens in the Divine Liturgy. With the mutual excommunications of the East West Schism in 1054, the churches in Rome and Constantinople each viewed the other as having departed from the true church, leaving a smaller but still catholic church in place. Each retained the Catholic part of its title, the Roman Catholic Church on the one hand, and the Orthodox Catholic Church on the other, each of which was defined in terms of inter communion with either Rome or Constantinople. While the Eastern Orthodox Church recognizes what it shares in common with other churches, including the Catholic Church, it sees catholicity in terms of complete union in communion and faith, with the Church throughout all time, and the sharing remains incomplete when not shared fully.  History   Early Church  Paul and the Apostles traveled extensively throughout the Roman Empire, including Asia Minor, establishing churches in major communities, with the first churches appearing in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome, Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries later would become prominent as the New Rome. Christianity encountered considerable resistance in the Roman Empire, mostly because its adherents refused to comply with the demands of the Roman state often even when their lives were threatened by offering sacrifices to the pagan gods. Despite persecution, skepticism, and initial social stigma, the Christian Church spread, particularly following the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in 312 AD.By the fourth century, Christianity was present in numerous regions well beyond the Levant. A number of influential schools of thought had arisen, particularly the Alexandrian and Antiochian philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the Arians, had also managed to gain influence. However, their positions caused theological conflicts within the church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical synod in order to define the church's position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the church. Most modern Christian churches regard this synod, commonly called the First Council of Nicaea or more generally the First Ecumenical Council, as of major importance.  Ecumenical councils  Several doctrinal disputes from the fourth century onwards led to the calling of ecumenical councils. In the Orthodox Church, an ecumenical council is the supreme authority that can be invoked to resolve contested issues of the faith. As such, these councils have been held to resolve the most important theological matters that came to be disputed within the Christian Church. Many lesser disagreements were resolved through local councils in the areas where they arose, before they grew significant enough to require an ecumenical council. There are seven councils authoritatively recognised as ecumenical by the Eastern Orthodox Church: The First Ecumenical Council was convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine at Nicaea in 325 and presided over by the Patriarch Alexander of Alexandria, with over 300 bishops condemning the view of Arius that the Son is a created being inferior to the Father. The Second Ecumenical Council was held at Constantinople in 381, presided over by the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, with 150 bishops, defining the nature of the Holy Spirit against those asserting His inequality with the other persons of the Trinity. The Third Ecumenical Council is that of Ephesus in 431, presided over by the Patriarch of Alexandria, with 250 bishops, which affirmed that Mary is truly Birthgiver or Mother of God , contrary to the teachings of Nestorius. The Fourth Ecumenical Council is that of Chalcedon in 451, Patriarch of Constantinople presiding, 500 bishops, affirmed that Jesus is truly God and truly man, without mixture of the two natures, contrary to Monophysite teaching. The Fifth Ecumenical Council is the second of Constantinople in 553, interpreting the decrees of Chalcedon and further explaining the relationship of the two natures of Jesus; it also condemned the alleged teachings of Origen on the pre existence of the soul, etc. The Sixth Ecumenical Council is the third of Constantinople in 681; it declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the Monothelites. The Seventh Ecumenical Council was called under the Empress Regent Irene of Athens in 787, known as the second of Nicaea. It supports the veneration of icons while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as The Triumph of Orthodoxy .There are also two other councils which are considered ecumenical by some Eastern Orthodox: The Fourth Council of Constantinople was called in 879. It restored Photius to his See in Constantinople and condemned any alteration of the Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed of 381. The Fifth Council of Constantinople was actually a series of councils held between 1341 and 1351. It affirmed the hesychastic theology of Gregory Palamas and condemned the philosopher Barlaam of Calabria.  Other major councils  In addition to these councils, there have been a number of other significant councils meant to further define the Eastern Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, in 1484, 1583, 1755, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Ia i in 1642, and the Pan Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem in 1672. Another council convened in June 2016 to discuss many modern phenomena, other Christian confessions, Eastern Orthodoxy's relation with other religions and fasting disciplines.  Roman Byzantine Empire  Constantinople is generally considered to be the center and the cradle of Orthodox Christian civilization . From the mid 5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe. Eastern Christian culture reached its golden age during the high point of the Byzantine Empire and continued to flourish in Ukraine and Russia, after the fall of Constantinople. Numerous autocephalous churches were established in Europe: Greece, Georgia, Ukraine, as well as in Russia and Asia. In the 530s the Church of the Holy Wisdom was built in Constantinople under Emperor Justinian I. Beginning with subsequent Byzantine architecture, Hagia Sophia became the paradigmatic Orthodox church form and its architectural style was emulated by Ottoman mosques a thousand years later. Being the episcopal see of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, it remained the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520. Hagia Sophia has been described as holding a unique position in the Christian world , and architectural and cultural icon of Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox civilization, and it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have changed the history of architecture .  Early schisms  There are the Nestorian churches resulted from the reaction of the Council of Ephesus , which are the earliest surviving Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople as legitimate. Nestorian is an outsider's term for a tradition that predated the influence of Nestorius, the origin of which might lay in certain sections of the School of Antioch or via Nestorius' teachers Theodore of Mopsuestia or Diodore of Tarsus. The modern incarnation of the Nestorian Church is commonly referred to as the Assyrian Church or fully as the Assyrian Church of the East. The church in Egypt split into two groups following the Council of Chalcedon , over a dispute about the relation between the divine and human natures of Jesus. Eventually this led to each group anathematizing the other. Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs are known today as the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, where the adjective Greek refers to their ties to the Greek speaking culture of the Byzantine Empire. However, those who disagreed with the findings of the Council of Chalcedon were the majority in Egypt, and today they are known as the Coptic Orthodox Church, having maintained a separate patriarchate. The Coptic Orthodox Church is currently the largest Christian church in Egypt and in the whole Middle East. There was also a similar, albeit smaller scale, split in Syria , which resulted in the separation of the Syriac Orthodox Church from the Byzantine Patriarchate of Antioch. Those who disagreed with the Council of Chalcedon are sometimes called Oriental Orthodox to distinguish them from the Eastern Orthodox , who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also sometimes referred to as non Chalcedonians , or anti Chalcedonians . The Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term miaphysite , to denote the united nature of Jesus consistent with Cyril's theology: The term union ... signifies the concurrence in one reality of those things which are understood to be united and the Word who is ineffably united with it in a manner beyond all description . This is also defined in the Coptic liturgy, where it is mentioned He made it his humanity one with his divinity without mingling, without confusion and without alteration , and His divinity parted not from his humanity for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye. They do not accept the teachings of Eutyches, or Eutychianism. Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church.  Conversion of South and East Slavs  In the ninth and tenth centuries, Christianity made great inroads into pagan Europe, including Bulgaria and later Kievan Rus' . This work was made possible by Cyril and Methodius of Thessaloniki, two brothers chosen by Byzantine emperor Michael III to fulfill the request of Rastislav of Moravia for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language. Cyril and Methodius began translating the divine liturgy, other liturgical texts, and the Gospels along with some other scriptural texts into local languages; with time, as these translations were copied by speakers of other dialects, the hybrid literary language Church Slavonic was created. Originally sent to convert the Slavs of Great Moravia, Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete with Frankish missionaries from the Roman diocese; their disciples were driven out of Great Moravia in AD 886 and emigrated to Bulgaria. After the Christianisation of Bulgaria in 864, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius in Bulgaria, the most important being Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav, were of great importance to the Orthodox faith in the First Bulgarian Empire. In a short time they managed to prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the biblical texts and in 870 AD the Fourth Council of Constantinople granted the Bulgarians the oldest organised autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church, which shortly thereafter became Patriarchate. The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of East Slavic peoples, most notably the Rus', predecessors of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians. A major event in this effort was the development of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria, at the Preslav Literary School in the ninth century; this script, along with the liturgical Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian, were declared official in Bulgaria in 893.The work of Cyril and Methodius and their disciples had a major impact on the Serbs as well. They accepted Christianity collectively along familial and tribal lines, a gradual process that occurred between the seventh and ninth centuries. In commemoration of their baptisms, each Serbian family or tribe began to celebrate an exclusively Serbian custom called Slava in a special way to honor the saint on whose day they received the sacrament of baptism. It is the most solemn day of the year for all Serbs of the Orthodox faith and has played a role of vital importance in the history of the Serbian people. Slava remains a celebration of the conversion of the Serbian people, which the church blessed and proclaimed a church institution.The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than Greek, the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire, or Latin, as the Roman priests did. Perhaps the greatest legacy of their efforts is the Russian Orthodox Church, which is the largest of the Orthodox churches.  Great Schism  In the 11th century, what was recognised as the Great Schism took place between Rome and Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine churches, now the Orthodox. There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and the authority of the Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic differences between Latins and Greeks. Regarding papal supremacy, the Eastern half grew disillusioned with the Pope's centralisation of power, as well as his blatant attempts of excluding the Eastern half in regard to papal approvals. It used to be that the emperor would at least have say when a new Pope would be elected, but towards the high Middle Ages, the Christians in Rome were slowly consolidating power and removing Byzantine influence. However, even before this exclusionary tendency from the West, well before 1054, the Eastern and Western halves of the Church were in perpetual conflict, particularly during the periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism. The final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450. The sacking of Church of Holy Wisdom and establishment of the Latin Empire as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204, which had also been strongly condemned by the Pope at the time, Innocent III; the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. However, many items stolen during this time, such as holy relics and riches, are still held in various European cities, particularly Venice.Reunion was attempted twice, at the 1274 Second Council of Lyon and the 1439 Council of Florence. The Council of Florence briefly reestablished communion between East and West, which lasted until after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. In each case, however, the councils were rejected by the Orthodox people as a whole, and the union of Florence also became very politically difficult after Constantinople came under Ottoman rule. However, in the time since, several local Orthodox Christian churches have renewed union with Rome, known as the Eastern Catholic Churches. Recent decades have seen a renewal of ecumenical spirit and dialogue between the Catholic and Orthodox churches.  Greek Church under Ottoman rule  The Byzantine Empire never fully recovered from the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Over the next two centuries, it entered a precipitous decline in both territory and influence. In 1453, a much diminished Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottoman Empire, ending what was once the most powerful state in the Orthodox Christian world, if not in all Christendom. By this time Egypt, another major center of Eastern Christianity, had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries; most Eastern Orthodox communities across southeastern Europe gradually came under Ottoman rule by the 16th century. Under the Ottomans, the Greek Orthodox Church acquired substantial power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the R m, an Ottoman administrative unit meaning Roman , which encompassed all Orthodox subjects of the Empire regardless of ethnicity. While legally subordinate to Muslims and subject to various restrictions, the Orthodox community was generally tolerated and left to govern its own internal affairs, both religiously and legally. Until the empire's dissolution in the early 20th century, Orthodox Christians would remain the largest non Muslim minority, and at times among the wealthiest and most politically influential. During the period 1914 1923 in Asia Minor the Greek Genocide took place by the Ottomans. During the Greek Genocide, many Orthodox Christians were persecuted and martyred. The culmination of the martyrdom was the Asia Minor Catastrophe with the killing of a large number of Orthodox. Among them, 347 clergymen of the Smyrna region and Metropolitan of Smyrna Chrysostomos were tortured and martyred. The period 1923 1924 was followed by the obligatory Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.  Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire  By the time most Orthodox communities came under Muslim rule in the mid 15th century, Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia, which had maintained close cultural and political ties with the Byzantine Empire; roughly two decades after the fall of Constantinople, Ivan III of Russia married Sophia Palaiologina, a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI, and styled himself Tsar or imperator. In 1547, his grandson Ivan IV, a devout Orthodox Christian, cemented the title as Tsar of All Rus , establishing Russia's first centralised state with divinely appointed rulers. In 1589, the Patriarchate of Constantinople granted autocephalous status to Moscow, the capital of what was now the largest Orthodox Christian polity; the city thereafter referred to itself as the Third Rome the cultural and religious heir of Constantinople. Until 1666, when Patriarch Nikon was deposed by the tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church had been independent of the State. In 1721, the first Russian Emperor, Peter I, abolished completely the patriarchate and effectively made the church a department of the government, ruled by a most holy synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Emperor himself. Over time, Imperial Russia would style itself a protector and patron of all Orthodox Christians, especially those within the Ottoman Empire.For nearly 200 years, until the Bolsheviks' October Revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox Church remained, in effect, a governmental agency and an instrument of tsarist rule. It was used to varying degrees in imperial campaigns of Russification, and was even allowed to levy taxes on peasants. The church's close ties with the state came to a head under Nicholas I , who explicitly made Orthodoxy a core doctrine of imperial unity and legitimacy. The Orthodox faith became further tied to Russian identity and nationalism, while the church was further subordinated to the interests of the state. Consequently, Russian Orthodox Church, along with the imperial regime to which it belonged, came to be presented as an enemy of the people by the Bolsheviks and other Russian revolutionaries.  Eastern Orthodox churches under Communist rule  After the October revolution of 1917, part of the clergy of the Russian Orthodox Church fled abroad to escape Bolshevik persecutions, founding an independent church in exile, which reunified with its Russian counterpart in 2007. Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with execution included torture, being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental hospitals. In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. However, in 1959, Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. It is estimated that 50,000 clergy had been executed between the revolution and the end of the Khrushchev era. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.Albania was the only state to have declared itself officially fully atheist. In some other Communist states such as Romania, the Romanian Orthodox Church as an organisation enjoyed relative freedom and even prospered, albeit under strict secret police control. That, however, did not rule out demolishing churches and monasteries as part of broader systematisation , and state persecution of individual believers. As an example of the latter, Romania stands out as a country which ran a specialised institution where many Orthodox were subjected to psychological punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in order to force them give up their religious convictions. However, this was only supported by one faction within the regime, and lasted only three years. The Communist authorities closed down the prison in 1952, and punished many of those responsible for abuses .  Post communism to 21st century  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent fall of communist governments across the Orthodox world, there has been marked growth in Christian Orthodoxy, particularly in Russia. According to the Pew Research Religion Public Life Project, between 1991 and 2008, the share of Russian adults identifying as Orthodox Christian rose from 31 percent to 72 percent, based on analysis of three waves of data from the International Social Survey Programme , a collaborative effort involving social scientists in about 50 countries.Pew research conducted in 2017 found a doubling in the global Orthodox population since the early 20th century, with the greatest resurgence in Russia. In the former Soviet Union where the largest Orthodox communities live self identified Orthodox Christians generally report low levels of observance and piety: In Russia, only 6 of Orthodox Christian adults reported attending church at least weekly, 15 say religion is very important in their lives, and 18 say they pray daily; other former Soviet republics display similarly low levels of religious observance.  1996 and 2018 Moscow Constantinople schisms   Organisation and leadership  The Eastern Orthodox Church is a fellowship of autocephalous churches, with the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople recognized as having the primus inter pares status. The patriarch of Constantinople has the honor of primacy, but his title is only first among equals and has no real authority over churches other than the Constantinopolitan and set out prerogatives interpreted by the ecumenical patriarch, though at times the office of the ecumenical patriarch has been accused of Constantinopolitan or Eastern papism. The Eastern Orthodox Church considers Jesus Christ to be the head of the church and the church to be his body. It is believed that authority and the grace of God is directly passed down to Orthodox bishops and clergy through the laying on of hands a practice started by the apostles, and that this unbroken historical and physical link is an essential element of the true church . The Eastern Orthodox assert that apostolic succession requires apostolic faith, and bishops without apostolic faith, who are in heresy, forfeit their claim to apostolic succession.The Eastern Orthodox communion is organised into several regional churches, which are either autocephalous or lower ranking autonomous church bodies unified in theology and worship. These include the fourteen autocephalous churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Georgia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, Greece, Poland, Romania, Albania, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which were officially invited to the Pan Orthodox Council of 2016; the Orthodox Church in America formed in 1970; the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine created in 2019; and the Macedonian Orthodox Church Ohrid Archbishopric, granted autocephaly by Serbian Orthodox Church in 2022; as well as a number of autonomous churches. Each church has a ruling bishop and a holy synod to administer its jurisdiction and to lead the Eastern Orthodox Church in the preservation and teaching of the apostolic and patristic traditions and church practices. Each bishop has a territory over which he governs. His main duty is to make sure the traditions and practices of the Eastern Orthodox Church are preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their territories are organised into various autocephalous groups or synods of bishops who gather together at least twice a year to discuss the state of affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Eastern Orthodox Church. Bishops are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.  Church councils  The ecumenical councils followed a democratic form, with each bishop having one vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the Imperial Roman Byzantine court, abbots, priests, deacons, monks and laymen were not allowed to vote. The primary goal of these great synods was to verify and confirm the fundamental beliefs of the Great Christian Church as truth, and to remove as heresy any false teachings that would threaten the Christian Church. The pope of Rome at that time held the position of primus inter pares and, while he was not present at any of the councils, he continued to hold this title until the East West Schism of 1054.Other councils have helped to define the Eastern Orthodox position, specifically the Quinisext Council, the Synods of Constantinople, 879 880, 1341, 1347, 1351, 1583, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Ia i, 1642, and the Pan Orthodox Synod of Jerusalem, 1672; the Pan Orthodox Council, held in Greece in 2016, was the only such Eastern Orthodox council in modern times. According to Eastern Orthodox teaching the position of first among equals gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds it, but rather that this person sits as organisational head of a council of equals .One of the decisions made by the First Council of Constantinople and supported by later such councils was that the Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honor to the Pope of Rome since Constantinople was considered to be the New Rome . According to the third canon of the second ecumenical council: Because Constantinople is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor after the bishop of Rome. The 28th canon of the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops actuated by the same consideration, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city which is honoured with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be magnified as she is. Because of the schism, the Eastern Orthodox no longer recognise the primacy of the pope of Rome. The patriarch of Constantinople therefore, like the Pope before him, now enjoys the title of first among equals .  Adherents  The most reliable estimates currently available number Eastern Orthodox adherents at around 220 million worldwide, making Eastern Orthodoxy the second largest Christian communion in the world after the Catholic Church.According to the 2015 Yearbook of International Religious Demography, as of 2010, the Eastern Orthodox population was 4 of the global population, declining from 7.1 in 1910. The study also found a decrease in proportional terms, with Eastern Orthodox Christians making up 12.2 of the world's total Christian population in 2015 compared to 20.4 a century earlier. A 2017 report by the Pew Research Center reached similar figures, noting that Eastern Orthodoxy has seen slower growth and less geographic spread than Catholicism and Protestantism, which were driven by colonialism and missionary activity across the world.Over two thirds of all Eastern Orthodox members are concentrated in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia, with significant minorities in Central Asia and the Levant. However, Eastern Orthodoxy has become more globalized over the last century, seeing greater growth in Western Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa; churches are present in the major cities of most countries. Adherents constitute the largest single religious community in Russia which is home to roughly half the world's Eastern Orthodox Christians and are the majority in Ukraine, Romania, Belarus, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Moldova, Georgia, North Macedonia, Cyprus, and Montenegro; communities also dominate the disputed territories of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. Significant Eastern Orthodox minorities exist in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Albania, Syria, and many other countries. Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the fastest growing religion in certain Western countries, primarily through labor migration from Eastern Europe, and to a lesser degree conversion. Ireland saw a doubling of its Eastern Orthodox population between 2006 and 2011. Spain and Germany have the largest communities in Western Europe, at roughly 1.5 million each, followed by Italy with around 900,000 and France with between 500,000 and 700,000. In the Americas, four countries have over 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians: Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States; all but the latter had fewer than 20,000 at the turn of the 20th century. The U.S. has seen its community more than quadruple since 1910, from 460,000 to 1.8 million as of 2017; consequently, the number of Eastern Orthodox parishes has been growing, with a 16 increase between 2000 and 2010.Turkey, which for centuries once had one of the largest Eastern Orthodox communities, saw its overall Christian population fall from roughly one fifth in 1914 to 2.5 in 1927. This was predominantly due to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, which saw most Christian territories become independent nations. The remaining Christian population was reduced further by large scale genocides against the Armenian, Greek, Assyrian communities; subsequent population exchanges between Greece and Turkey and Bulgaria and Turkey; and associated emigration of Christians to foreign countries . Today, only 0.2 of Turkey's population represent either Jews or various Christian denominations .  Theology   Trinity  Orthodox Christians believe in the Trinity, three distinct, divine persons , without overlap or modality among them, who each have one divine essence uncreated, immaterial, and eternal. These three persons are typically distinguished by their relation to each other. The Father is eternal and not begotten and does not proceed from any, the Son is eternal and begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit is eternal and proceeds from the Father. Orthodox doctrine regarding the Trinity is summarised in the Nicene Creed.Orthodox Christians believe in a monotheistic conception of God , which is both transcendent and immanent . In discussing God's relationship to his creation, Orthodox theology distinguishes between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and his uncreated energies, which is how he reaches humanity. The God who is transcendent and the God who touches mankind are one and the same. That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from God's inner being. This view is often called Palamism. In understanding the Trinity as one God in three persons , three persons is not to be emphasised more than one God , and vice versa. While the three persons are distinct, they are united in one divine essence, and their oneness is expressed in community and action so completely that they cannot be considered separately. For example, their salvation of mankind is an activity engaged in common: Christ became man by the good will of the Father and by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit. Christ sends the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father, and the Holy Spirit forms Christ in our hearts, and thus God the Father is glorified. Their communion of essence is indivisible . Trinitarian terminology essence, hypostasis, etc. are used philosophically , to answer the ideas of the heretics , and to place the terms where they separate error and truth. The words do what they can do, but the nature of the Trinity in its fullness is believed to remain beyond man's comprehension and expression, a holy mystery that can only be experienced.  Sin, salvation, and the incarnation  When Eastern Orthodox Christians refer to fallen nature they are not saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed in the image of God; humans are still God's creation, and God has never created anything evil, but fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said among Orthodox that humans are inclined to sin ; that is, people find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors.Since the fall of man, then, it has been mankind's dilemma that no human can restore his nature to union with God's grace; it was necessary for God to effect another change in human nature. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both God and Man absolutely and completely, having two natures indivisibly: eternally begotten of the Father in his divinity, he was born in his humanity of a woman, Mary, by her consent, through descent of the Holy Spirit. He lived on earth, in time and history, as a man. As a man he also died, and went to the place of the dead, which is Hades. But being God, neither death nor Hades could contain him, and he rose to life again, in his humanity, by the power of the Holy Spirit, thus destroying the power of Hades and of death itself.Through Christ's destruction of Hades' power to hold humanity hostage, he made the path to salvation effective for all the righteous who had died from the beginning of time saving many, including Adam and Eve, who are remembered in the church as saints.  Resurrection of Christ  The Eastern Orthodox Church understands the death and resurrection of Jesus to be real historical events, as described in the gospels of the New Testament.  Christian life  Church teaching is that Orthodox Christians, through baptism, enter a new life of salvation through repentance whose purpose is to share in the life of God through the work of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Christian life is a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person, through the imitation of Christ and hesychasm, cultivates the practice of unceasing prayer. Each life occurs within the life of the church as a member of the body of Christ. It is then through the fire of God's love in the action of the Holy Spirit that each member becomes more holy, more wholly unified with Christ, starting in this life and continuing in the next. The church teaches that everyone, being born in God's image, is called to theosis, fulfillment of the image in likeness to God. God the creator, having divinity by nature, offers each person participation in divinity by cooperatively accepting His gift of grace.The Eastern Orthodox Church, in understanding itself to be the Body of Christ, and similarly in understanding the Christian life to lead to the unification in Christ of all members of his body, views the church as embracing all Christ's members, those now living on earth, and also all those through the ages who have passed on to the heavenly life. The church includes the Christian saints from all times, and also judges, prophets and righteous Jews of the first covenant, Adam and Eve, even the angels and heavenly hosts. In Orthodox services, the earthly members together with the heavenly members worship God as one community in Christ, in a union that transcends time and space and joins heaven to earth. This unity of the church is sometimes called the communion of the saints.  Virgin Mary and other saints  The Eastern Orthodox Church believes death and the separation of body and soul to be unnatural a result of the Fall of Man. They also hold that the congregation of the church comprises both the living and the dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be saints, whether their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed and ultimately recognised by a large portion of the church a service of official recognition is celebrated. This does not make the person a saint; it merely recognises the fact and announces it to the rest of the church. A day is prescribed for the saint's celebration, hymns composed and icons created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year. They are venerated but not worshipped, for worship is due God alone . In showing the saints this love and requesting their prayers, the Eastern Orthodox manifest their belief that the saints thus assist in the process of salvation for others. Pre eminent among the saints is the Virgin Mary . In Eastern Orthodox theology, the Mother of God is the fulfillment of the Old Testament archetypes revealed in the Ark of the Covenant and the burning bush that appeared before Moses .The Eastern Orthodox believe that Christ, from the moment of his conception, was both fully God and fully human. Mary is thus called the Theotokos or Bogoroditsa as an affirmation of the divinity of the one to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not compromised in conceiving God incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she remained forever a virgin. Scriptural references to brothers of Christ are interpreted as kin, given that the word brother was used in multiple ways, as was the term father . Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary is honoured above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work that God accomplished through her.The Eastern Orthodox Church regards the bodies of all saints as holy, made such by participation in the holy mysteries, especially the communion of Christ's holy body and blood, and by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the church. Indeed, that persons and physical things can be made holy is a cornerstone of the doctrine of the Incarnation, made manifest also directly by God in Old Testament times through his dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant. Thus, physical items connected with saints are also regarded as holy, through their participation in the earthly works of those saints. According to church teaching and tradition, God himself bears witness to this holiness of saints' relics through the many miracles connected with them that have been reported throughout history since biblical times, often including healing from disease and injury.  Eschatology  Orthodox Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated from the body. Though it may linger for a short period on Earth, it is ultimately escorted either to paradise or the darkness of Hades, following the Temporary Judgment. Orthodox do not accept the doctrine of Purgatory, which is held by Catholicism. The soul's experience of either of these states is only a foretaste being experienced only by the soul until the Final Judgment, when the soul and body will be reunited.The Eastern Orthodox believe that the state of the soul in Hades can be affected by the love and prayers of the righteous up until the Last Judgment. For this reason the Church offers a special prayer for the dead on the third day, ninth day, fortieth day, and the one year anniversary after the death of an Orthodox Christian. There are also several days throughout the year that are set aside for general commemoration of the departed, sometimes including nonbelievers. These days usually fall on a Saturday, since it was on a Saturday that Christ lay in the Tomb.The Eastern Orthodox believe that after the Final Judgment: All souls will be reunited with their resurrected bodies. All souls will fully experience their spiritual state. Having been perfected, the saints will forever progress towards a deeper and fuller love of God, which equates with eternal happiness.  Bible  The official Bible of the Eastern Orthodox Church contains the Septuagint text of the Old Testament, with the Book of Daniel given in the translation by Theodotion. The Patriarchal Text is used for the New Testament. Orthodox Christians hold that the Bible is a verbal icon of Christ, as proclaimed by the 7th ecumenical council. They refer to the Bible as holy scripture, meaning writings containing the foundational truths of the Christian faith as revealed by Christ and the Holy Spirit to its divinely inspired human authors. Holy scripture forms the primary and authoritative written witness of holy tradition and is essential as the basis for all Orthodox teaching and belief.Once established as holy scripture, there has never been any question that the Eastern Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study, even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the Anagignoskomena comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon, but deemed by the Eastern Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon. The lowest tier contains the remaining books not accepted by either Protestants or Catholics, among them, Psalm 151. Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter .In a very strict sense, it is not entirely orthodox to call the holy scripture the Word of God . That is a title the Eastern Orthodox Church reserves for Christ, as supported in the scriptures themselves, most explicitly in the first chapter of the gospel of John. God's Word is not hollow, like human words. God said, 'let there be light'; and there was light. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not subscribe to the Protestant doctrine of sola scriptura. The church has defined what Scripture is; it also interprets what its meaning is. Christ promised: When He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth .Scriptures are understood to contain historical fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy and wisdom literature, and each bears its own consideration in its interpretation. While divinely inspired, the text still consists of words in human languages, arranged in humanly recognisable forms. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not oppose honest critical and historical study of the Bible.  Territorial expansion and doctrinal integrity  As the church increased in size through the centuries, the logistic dynamics of operating such large entities shifted: patriarchs, metropolitans, archimandrites, abbots and abbesses, all rose up to cover certain points of administration.  Liturgy   Church calendar  Lesser cycles also run in tandem with the annual ones. A weekly cycle of days prescribes a specific focus for each day in addition to others that may be observed.Each day of the Weekly Cycle is dedicated to certain special memorials. Sunday is dedicated to Christ's Resurrection; Monday honors the holy bodiless powers ; Tuesday is dedicated to the prophets and especially the greatest of the prophets, John the Forerunner and Baptist of the Lord; Wednesday is consecrated to the Cross and recalls Judas' betrayal; Thursday honors the holy apostles and hierarchs, especially Nicholas, Bishop of Myra in Lycia; Friday is also consecrated to the Cross and recalls the day of the Crucifixion; Saturday is dedicated to All Saints, especially the Mother of God, and to the memory of all those who have departed this life in the hope of resurrection and eternal life.  Church services   Music and chanting  The church has developed eight modes or tones within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year, feast day, or other considerations of the Typikon. There are numerous versions and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal between cultures.  Traditions   Art and architecture  The Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on New York City's Upper East Side is the largest Orthodox Christian church in the Western Hemisphere.  Local customs  Locality is also expressed in regional terms of churchly jurisdiction, which is often also drawn along national lines. Many Orthodox churches adopt a national title and this title can identify which language is used in services, which bishops preside, and which of the typica is followed by specific congregations. In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians are usually referred to as Rum Orthodox, because of their historical connection with the Eastern Roman Empire.  Holy mysteries  Those things which in the West are often termed sacraments or sacramentals are known among the Eastern Orthodox as the sacred mysteries . While the Roman Catholic Church numbers seven sacraments, and many Protestant groups list two or even none, the Eastern Orthodox do not limit the number. However, for the sake of convenience, catechisms will often speak of the seven great mysteries. Among these are Holy Communion , baptism, Chrismation, confession, unction, matrimony, and ordination. But the term also properly applies to other sacred actions such as monastic tonsure or the blessing of holy water, and involves fasting, almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying or asking God's blessing on food.  Baptism  Baptism is the mystery which transforms the old and sinful person into a new and pure one; the old life, the sins, any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through baptism a person is united to the Body of Christ by becoming a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. During the service, water is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the water three times in the name of the Trinity. This is considered to be a death of the old man by participation in the crucifixion and burial of Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his resurrection.Properly, the mystery of baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Eastern Orthodox Christian can baptise.  Chrismation  Chrismation is the mystery by which a baptised person is granted the gift of the Holy Spirit through anointing with Holy Chrism. It is normally given immediately after baptism as part of the same service, but is also used to receive lapsed members of the Eastern Orthodox Church. As baptism is a person's participation in the death and resurrection of Christ, so Chrismation is a person's participation in the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.A baptised and chrismated Eastern Orthodox Christian is a full member of the church and may receive the Eucharist regardless of age.The creation of Chrism may be accomplished by any bishop at any time, but usually is done only once a year, often when a synod of bishops convenes for its annual meeting. Some autocephalous churches get their chrism from others. Anointing with it substitutes for the laying on of hands described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is used.  Holy Communion  Communion is given only to baptised and chrismated Eastern Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will administer the gifts with a spoon, called a cochlear , directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice. From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive holy communion.  Repentance    Marriage  From the Orthodox perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments. As well as in many other Christian traditions, for example in Catholicism, it serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the purpose of following Christ and his Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy family through their holy union. The church understands marriage to be the union of one man and one woman, and certain Orthodox leaders have spoken out strongly in opposition to the civil institution of same sex marriage.Jesus said that when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven . For the Orthodox Christian this passage should not be understood to imply that Christian marriage will not remain a reality in the Kingdom, but points to the fact that relations will not be fleshy , but spiritual . Love between wife and husband, as an icon of relationship between Christ and church, is eternal.The church does recognise that there are rare occasions when it is better that couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces. For the Eastern Orthodox, to say that marriage is indissoluble means that it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulting from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the church towards sinful man.  Holy orders  Widowed priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery . This is also true of widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to receive holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church.In 2016, the Patriarchate of Alexandria decided to reintroduce the order of deaconess. In February 2017, Patriarch Theodoros II consecrated five women to be deaconesses within the Patriarchate of Alexandria.  Unction   Interfaith relations   Relations with other Christians  In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, published an encyclical addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations . This gesture was instrumental in the foundation of the World Council of Churches ; as such, almost all Eastern Orthodox churches are members of the WCC and Orthodox ecclesiastics and theologians serve on its committees . Kallistos Ware, a British metropolitan bishop of the Orthodox Church, has stated that ecumenism is important for Orthodoxy: it has helped to force the various Orthodox churches out of their comparative isolation, making them meet one another and enter into a living contact with non Orthodox Christians. Hilarion Alfeyev, Metropolitan of Volokolamsk and head of external relations for the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, stated that Orthodox and Evangelical Protestant Christians share the same positions on such issues as abortion, the family, and marriage and desire vigorous grassroots engagement between the two Christian communions on such issues. In that regard, the differences between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox communions have not been improved in any relevant way. Dogmatic and liturgical polarities have been significant, even and especially in recent times. A pertinent point of contention between the monarchically papal, administratively centralised Catholic Church and the decentralised confederation of Orthodox churches is the theological significance of the Virgin Mary. During his visit to Georgia in October 2016, Pope Francis was snubbed by most Orthodox Christians as he led mass before a practically empty Mikheil Meskhi Stadium in Tbilisi.The Oriental Orthodox Churches are not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Church, despite their similar names. Slow dialogue towards restoring communion between the two churches began in the mid 20th century, and, notably, in the 19th century, when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself from the country for a long period of time; he left his church under the guidance of the Coptic Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria.In 2019, the Primate of the OCU Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Ukraine Epiphanius stated that theoretically the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church could in the future unite into a united church around the Kyiv throne. In 2019, the Primate of the UGCC, Major Archbishop of Kyiv Galicia Sviatoslav, stated that every effort should be made to restore the original unity of the Kyivan Church in its Orthodox and Catholic branches, saying that the restoration of Eucharistic communion between Rome and Constantinople is not a utopia.Notwithstanding certain overtures by both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox leaders, the majority of Orthodox Christians, as well as Catholics, are not in favor of communion between their churches, with only a median of 35 percent and 38 percent, respectively, claiming support.  Relations with Islam  According to Bat Ye'or, Christians under Islamic rule were denied equality of rights since they were forced to pay the jizya poll tax.In 2007, Metropolitan Alfeyev expressed the possibility of peaceful coexistence between Islam and Christianity in Russia, as the two religions have never had religious wars in Russia.  Constituencies  The various autocephalous and autonomous synods of the Eastern Orthodox Church are distinct in terms of administration and local culture, but for the most part exist in full communion with one another. In addition, some schismatic churches not in any communion exist, with all three groups identifying as Eastern Orthodox. Another group of non mainstream Eastern Orthodox Christians are referred True Orthodoxy or Old Calendarists; they are those who, without authority from their parent churches, have continued to use the old Julian calendar, and split from their parent church. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia has united in 2007 with the Moscow Patriarchate; these two churches had separated from each other in the 1920s due to the subjection of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime. Another group called the Old Believers, separated in 1666 from the official Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church rite reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow.  Main communion  The Eastern Orthodox Church is a communion of 15 autocephalous that is, administratively completely independent regional churches, plus the Orthodox Church in America and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The Orthodox Church in America is recognised as autocephalous only by the Russian, Bulgarian, Georgian, Polish and Czech Slovak churches. In December 2018, representatives of two unrecognized Ukrainian Orthodox churches, along with two metropolitans of the recognized, but not autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, proclaimed the formation of the unified Orthodox Church of Ukraine. On 5 January 2019, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine received its tomos of autocephaly from the Ecumenical Patriarchate and thus received a place in the diptych. Each church has defined geographical boundaries of its jurisdiction and is ruled by its council of bishops or synod presided by a senior bishop its primate . The primate may carry the honorary title of patriarch, metropolitan or archbishop . Each regional church consists of constituent eparchies ruled by a bishop. Some churches have given an eparchy or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy . Such autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother church, usually defined in a tomos or other document of autonomy. Below is a list of the 14 autocephalous Orthodox churches forming the main body of Orthodox Christianity, all of which are titled equal to each other, but the Ecumenical Patriarchate is titled the first among equals. Based on the definitions, the list is in the order of precedence and alphabetical order where necessary, with some of their constituent autonomous churches and exarchates listed as well. The liturgical title of the primate is in italics. Within the main body of Eastern Orthodoxy there are unresolved internal issues as to the autonomous or autocephalous status or legitimacy of the following Orthodox churches, particularly between those stemming from the Russian Orthodox or Constantinopolitan churches:  Traditionalist groups   True Orthodox  True Orthodoxy has been separated from the mainstream communion over issues of ecumenism and calendar reform since the 1920s. The movement rejects the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Moscow Patriarchate, and all churches which are in communion with them, accusing them of heresy and placing themselves under bishops who do the same thing. They adhere to the use of the Julian calendar, claiming that the calendar reform in the 1920s is in contradiction with the ecumenical councils. There is no official communion of True Orthodox; and they often are local groups and are limited to a specific bishop or locality.  Old calendarists    Old Believers  Old Believers are groups which do not accept the liturgical reforms which were carried out within the Russian Orthodox Church by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in the 17th century. Although all of the groups of Old Believers emerged as a result of opposition to the Nikonian reforms, they do not constitute a single monolithic body. Despite their emphasis on invariable adherence to the pre Nikonian traditions, the Old Believers feature a great diversity of groups which profess different interpretations of church tradition and they are often not in communion with each other .  Churches not in communion with other churches  Churches with irregular or unresolved canonical status are entities that have carried out episcopal consecrations outside of the norms of canon law or whose bishops have been excommunicated by one of the 14 autocephalous churches. These include nationalist and other schismatic bodies such as the Abkhazian Orthodox Church.

Edholm's law also holds that data rates for these telecommunications categories increase on similar exponential curves, with the slower rates trailing the faster ones by a predictable time lag. Edholm's law predicts that the bandwidth and data rates double every 18 months, which has proven to be true since the 1970s. The trend is evident in the cases of Internet, cellular , wireless LAN and wireless personal area networks.  Concept Edholm's law was proposed by Phil Edholm of Nortel Networks. He observed that telecommunication bandwidth was doubling every 18 months, since the late 1970s through to the early 2000s. This is similar to Moore's law, which predicts an exponential rate of growth for transistor counts. He also found that there was a gradual convergence between wired , nomadic and wireless networks . The name Edholm's law was coined by his colleague, John H. Yoakum, who presented it at a 2004 Internet telephony press conference.Slower communications channels like cellphones and radio modems were predicted to eclipse the capacity of early Ethernet, due to developments in the standards known as UMTS and MIMO, which boosted bandwidth by maximizing antenna usage. Extrapolating forward indicates a convergence between the rates of nomadic and wireless technologies around 2030. In addition, wireless technology could end wireline communication if the cost of the latter's infrastructure remains high.  Underlying factors In 2009, Renuka P. Jindal observed the bandwidths of online communication networks rising from bits per second to terabits per second, doubling every 18 months, as predicted by Edholm's law. Jindal identified the following three major underlying factors that have enabled the exponential growth of communication bandwidth. MOSFET  The MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. It is the basic building block of telecommunications networks, and powers the worldwide Internet with high speed and low power MOS integrated circuits. Advances in MOSFET technology has been the most important contributing factor in the rapid rise of bandwidth in telecommunications networks. Continuous MOSFET scaling, along with various advances in MOS technology, has enabled both Moore's law and Edholm's law . Laser lightwave systems The laser was demonstrated by Charles H. Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow at Bell Labs in 1960. Laser technology was later adopted in the design of integrated electronics using MOS technology, leading to the development of lightwave systems around 1980. This has led to exponential growth of bandwidth since the early 1980s. Information theory Information theory, as enunciated by Claude Shannon at Bell Labs in 1948, provided a theoretical foundation to understand the trade offs between signal to noise ratio, bandwidth, and error free transmission in the presence of noise, in telecommunications technology. In the early 1980s, Renuka Jindal at Bell Labs used information theory to study the noise behaviour of MOS devices, improving their noise performance and resolving issues that limited their receiver sensitivity and data rates. This led to a significant improvement in the noise performance of MOS technology, and contributed to the wide adoption of MOS technology in lightwave and then wireless terminal applications.The bandwidths of wireless networks have been increasing at a faster pace compared to wired networks. This is due to advances in MOSFET wireless technology enabling the development and growth of digital wireless networks. The wide adoption of RF CMOS , power MOSFET and LDMOS devices led to the development and proliferation of digital wireless networks by the 1990s, with further advances in MOSFET technology leading to rapidly increasing bandwidth since the 2000s. Most of the essential elements of wireless networks are built from MOSFETs, including the mobile transceivers, base station modules, routers, RF power amplifiers, telecommunication circuits, RF circuits, and radio transceivers, in networks such as 2G, 3G, and 4G.In recent years, another enabling factor in the growth of wireless communication networks has been interference alignment, which was discovered by Syed Ali Jafar at the University of California, Irvine. He established it as a general principle, along with Viveck R. Cadambe, in 2008. They introduced a mechanism to align an arbitrarily large number of interferers, leading to the surprising conclusion that wireless networks are not essentially interference limited. This led to the adoption of interference alignment in the design of wireless networks. According to New York University senior researcher Dr. Paul Horn, this revolutionized our understanding of the capacity limits of wireless networks and demonstrated the astounding result that each user in a wireless network can access half of the spectrum without interference from other users, regardless of how many users are sharing the spectrum.

            "text": "The Edison Machine Works was a manufacturing company set up to produce dynamos, large electric motors, and other components of the electrical illumination system being built in the 1880s by Thomas A. Edison in New York City.  History The need for equipment in the development of a large scale electric illumination utility in New York City, starting around 1880, soon outstripped the capacity of Thomas Edison's machine shop at Menlo Park. To alleviate the problem in 1881 Edison leased the old Etna Iron Works on Goerck Street, Lower Manhattan and set up the Edison Machine Works with Edison providing 90 of the capital and investor partner Charles Batchelor providing 10 . The workforce built up to some 800 men supervised by Edison machinist Charles Dean. This shop supplied jumbo dynamos for the original Pearl Street Station as well as dynamos of various sizes for the different types of electric light installations Edison was offering customers. The Machine Works was incorporated in 1884 with Edison investor Charles Batchelor as general manager, John Kruesi as assistant general manager, and Samuel Insull as secretary. At the end of 1885 the Electric Tube Company and the Edison Shafting Manufacturing Company were merged into the Edison Machine Works. The Machine Works also had a department that designed and tested equipment and trained Edison workers how to wire buildings and install and repair dynamos. New types of dynamos were designed here as well as improved power consumption meters. The demands of the expanding utility soon overtaxed the cramped lower Manhattan shop. Extra lathes needed for production had to be set up on the sidewalks outside the building connected through the factory windows by long drive belts. Strikes, unionizing attempts, and the general expense of labor and land in New York City sent Edison looking for a site for a new factory. In 1886 the Machine Works, along with 200 of its workers, were moved to two unfinished factory buildings on a 10 acre site in Schenectady, NY, intended to have been the McQueen Locomotive Works. The new factory was put under the control of Samuel Insull. Edison Machine Works continued as a separate company until 1889, when all of Edison's electric related companies were merged to form Edison General Electric. The plant expanded rapidly and 1892 saw the merger of Edison General Electric and the Thomson Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts to form General Electric with the Schenectady location used as GE's headquarters for many years thereafter.

            "text": "Edwin Howard Armstrong was an American electrical engineer and inventor, who developed FM radio and the superheterodyne receiver system. He held 42 patents and received numerous awards, including the first Medal of Honor awarded by the Institute of Radio Engineers , the French Legion of Honor, the 1941 Franklin Medal and the 1942 Edison Medal. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and included in the International Telecommunication Union's roster of great inventors. Armstrong attended Columbia University, and served as a professor there for most of his life.  Early life  Armstrong was born in the Chelsea district of New York City, the oldest of John and Emily Armstrong's three children. His father began working at a young age at the American branch of the Oxford University Press, which published bibles and standard classical works, eventually advancing to the position of vice president. His parents first met at the North Presbyterian Church, located at 31st Street and Ninth Avenue. His mother's family had strong ties to Chelsea, and an active role in church functions. When the church moved north, the Smiths and Armstrongs followed, and in 1895 the Armstrong family moved from their brownstone row house at 347 West 29th Street to a similar house at 26 West 97th Street in the Upper West Side. The family was comfortably middle class. At the age of eight, Armstrong contracted Sydenham's chorea , an infrequent but serious neurological disorder precipitated by rheumatic fever. For the rest of his life, Armstrong was afflicted with a physical tic exacerbated by excitement or stress. Due to this illness, he withdrew from public school and was home tutored for two years. To improve his health, the Armstrong family moved to a house overlooking the Hudson River, at 1032 Warburton Avenue in Yonkers. The Smith family subsequently moved next door. Armstrong's tic and the time missed from school led him to become socially withdrawn. From an early age, Armstrong showed an interest in electrical and mechanical devices, particularly trains. He loved heights and constructed a makeshift backyard antenna tower that included a bosun's chair for hoisting himself up and down its length, to the concern of neighbors. Much of his early research was conducted in the attic of his parents' house.In 1909, Armstrong enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, where he became a member of the Epsilon Chapter of the Theta Xi engineering fraternity, and studied under Professor Michael Pupin at the Hartley Laboratories, a separate research unit at Columbia. Another of his instructors, Professor John H. Morecroft, later remembered Armstrong as being intensely focused on the topics that interested him, but somewhat indifferent to the rest of his studies. Armstrong challenged conventional wisdom and was quick to question the opinions of both professors and peers. In one case, he recounted how he tricked a visiting professor from Cornell University that he disliked into receiving a severe electrical shock. He also stressed the practical over the theoretical, stating that progress was more likely the product of experimentation and reasoning than on mathematical calculation and the formulae of mathematical physics . Armstrong graduated from Columbia in 1913, earning an electrical engineering degree.During World War I, Armstrong served in the Signal Corps as a captain and later a major.Following college graduation, he received a 600 one year appointment as a laboratory assistant at Columbia, after which he nominally worked as a research assistant, for a salary of 1 a year, under Professor Pupin. Unlike most engineers, Armstrong never became a corporate employee. He set up a self financed independent research and development laboratory at Columbia, and owned his patents outright. In 1934, he filled the vacancy left by John H. Morecroft's death, receiving an appointment as a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Columbia, a position he held the remainder of his life.  Early work   Regenerative circuit  Armstrong began working on his first major invention while still an undergraduate at Columbia. In late 1906, Lee de Forest had invented the three element grid Audion vacuum tube. How vacuum tubes worked was not understood at the time. De Forest's initial Audions did not have a high vacuum and developed a blue glow at modest plate voltages; De Forest improved the vacuum for Federal Telegraph. By 1912, vacuum tube operation was understood, and regenerative circuits using high vacuum tubes were appreciated. While growing up, Armstrong had experimented with the early temperamental, gassy Audions. Spurred by the later discoveries, he developed a keen interest in gaining a detailed scientific understanding of how vacuum tubes worked. In conjunction with Professor Morecroft he used an oscillograph to conduct comprehensive studies. His breakthrough discovery was determining that employing positive feedback produced amplification hundreds of times greater than previously attained, with the amplified signals now strong enough so that receivers could use loudspeakers instead of headphones. Further investigation revealed that when the feedback was increased beyond a certain level a vacuum tube would go into oscillation, thus could also be used as a continuous wave radio transmitter. Beginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared a series of comprehensive demonstrations and papers that carefully documented his research, and in late 1913 applied for patent protection covering the regenerative circuit. On October 6, 1914, U.S. Patent 1,113,149 was issued for his discovery. Although Lee de Forest initially discounted Armstrong's findings, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of competing patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, now stating that he had discovered regeneration first, based on August 6, 1912 notebook entry, while working for the Federal Telegraph company, prior to the January 31, 1913 date recognized for Armstrong. The result was an interference hearing at the patent office to determine priority. De Forest was not the only other inventor involved the four competing claimants included Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and Alexander Meissner, who was a German national, which led to his application being seized by the Office of Alien Property Custodian during World War I.Following the end of WWI Armstrong enlisted representation by the law firm of Pennie, Davis, Martin and Edmonds. To finance his legal expenses he began issuing non transferable licenses for use of the regenerative patents to a select group of small radio equipment firms, and by November 1920 17 companies had been licensed. These licensees paid 5 royalties on their sales which were restricted to only amateurs and experimenters . Meanwhile, Armstrong reviewed his options for selling the commercial rights to his work. Although the obvious candidate was the Radio Corporation of America , on October 5, 1920 the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company took out an option for 335,000 for the commercial rights for both the regenerative and superheterodyne patents, with an additional 200,000 to be paid if Armstrong prevailed in the regenerative patent dispute. Westinghouse exercised this option on November 4, 1920.Legal proceedings related to the regeneration patent became separated into two groups of court cases. An initial court action was triggered in 1919 when Armstrong sued de Forest's company in district court, alleging infringement of patent 1,113,149. This court ruled in Armstrong's favor on May 17, 1921. A second line of court cases, the result of the patent office interference hearing, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, but he was unwilling to settle with de Forest for less than what he considered full compensation. Thus pressured, de Forest continued his legal defense, and appealed the interference board decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court ruled that it was de Forest who should be considered regeneration's inventor. Armstrong was shocked by these events, and his side appealed this decision. Although the legal proceeding twice went before the US Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, he was unsuccessful in overturning the decision.In response to the second Supreme Court decision upholding de Forest as the inventor of regeneration, Armstrong attempted to return his 1917 IRE Medal of Honor, which had been awarded in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non oscillating audion . The organization's board refused to allow him, and issued a statement that it strongly affirms the original award .  Superheterodyne circuit  The United States entered into WWI in April 1917. Later that year Armstrong was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and assigned to a laboratory in Paris, France to help develop radio communication for the Allied war effort. He returned to the US in the autumn of 1919, after being promoted to the rank of Major. During this period Armstrong's most significant accomplishment was the development of a supersonic heterodyne soon shortened to superheterodyne radio receiver circuit. This circuit made radio receivers more sensitive and selective and is extensively used today. The key feature of the superheterodyne approach is the mixing of the incoming radio signal with a locally generated, different frequency signal within a radio set. This circuit is called the mixer. The result is a fixed, unchanging intermediate frequency, or I.F. signal which is easily amplified and detected by following circuit stages. In 1919, Armstrong filed an application for a US patent of the superheterodyne circuit which was issued the next year. This patent was subsequently sold to Westinghouse. The patent was challenged, triggering another patent office interference hearing. Armstrong ultimately lost this patent battle; although the outcome was less controversial than that involving the regeneration proceedings.The challenger was Lucien L vy of France who had worked developing Allied radio communication during WWI. He had been awarded French patents in 1917 and 1918 that covered some of the same basic ideas used in Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver. AT T, interested in radio development at this time, primarily for point to point extensions of its wired telephone exchanges, purchased the US rights to L vy's patent and contested Armstrong's grant. The subsequent court reviews continued until 1928, when the District of Columbia Court of Appeals disallowed all nine claims of Armstrong's patent, assigning priority for seven of the claims to L vy, and one each to Ernst Alexanderson of General Electric and Burton W. Kendall of Bell Laboratories.Although most early radio receivers used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's David Sarnoff, whom he had known since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public. Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine vacuum tubes. In conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the US market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other US companies until 1930.  Super regeneration circuit  The regeneration legal battle had one serendipitous outcome for Armstrong. While he was preparing apparatus to counteract a claim made by a patent attorney, he accidentally ran into the phenomenon of super regeneration , where, by rapidly quenching the vacuum tube oscillations, he was able to achieve even greater levels of amplification. A year later, in 1922, Armstrong sold his super regeneration patent to RCA for 200,000 plus 60,000 shares of corporation stock, which was later increased to 80,000 shares in payment for consulting services. This made Armstrong RCA's largest shareholder, and he noted that The sale of that invention was to net me more than the sale of the regenerative circuit and the superheterodyne combined . RCA envisioned selling a line of super regenerative receivers until superheterodyne sets could be perfected for general sales, but it turned out the circuit was not selective enough to make it practical for broadcast receivers.  Wide band FM radio  Static interference extraneous noises caused by sources such as thunderstorms and electrical equipment bedeviled early radio communication using amplitude modulation and perplexed numerous inventors attempting to eliminate it. Many ideas for static elimination were investigated, with little success. In the mid 1920s, Armstrong began researching a solution. He initially, and unsuccessfully, attempted to resolve the problem by modifying the characteristics of AM transmissions. One approach had been the use of frequency modulation transmissions. Instead of varying the strength of the carrier wave as with AM, the frequency of the carrier was changed to represent the desired audio signal. In 1922 John Renshaw Carson of AT T, inventor of Single sideband modulation , had published a detailed mathematical analysis which showed that FM transmissions did not provide any improvement over AM. Although the Carson bandwidth rule for FM is important today, this review turned out to be incomplete, because it analyzed only what is now known as narrow band FM. In early 1928 Armstrong began researching the capabilities of FM. Although there were others involved in FM research at this time, he knew of an RCA project to see if FM shortwave transmissions were less susceptible to fading than AM. In 1931 the RCA engineers constructed a successful FM shortwave link transmitting the Schmeling Stribling fight broadcast from California to Hawaii, and noted at the time that the signals seemed to be less affected by static. The project made little further progress.Working in secret in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Armstrong developed wide band FM, in the process discovering significant advantages over the earlier narrow band FM transmissions. In a wide band FM system, the deviations of the carrier frequency are made to be much larger in magnitude than the frequency of the audio signal; this can be shown to provide better noise rejection. He was granted five US patents covering the basic features of new system on December 26, 1933. Initially, the primary claim was that his FM system was effective at filtering out the noise produced in receivers by vacuum tubes.Armstrong had a standing agreement to give RCA the right of first refusal to his patents. In 1934 he presented his new system to RCA president Sarnoff. Sarnoff was somewhat taken aback by its complexity, as he had hoped it would be possible to eliminate static merely by adding a simple device to existing receivers. From May 1934 until October 1935 Armstrong conducted field tests of his FM technology from an RCA laboratory located on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building in New York City. An antenna attached to the building's spire transmitted signals for distances up to 80 miles . These tests helped demonstrate FM's static reduction and high fidelity capabilities. RCA, which was heavily invested in perfecting TV broadcasting, chose not to invest in FM, and instructed Armstrong to remove his equipment.Denied the marketing and financial clout of RCA, Armstrong decided to finance his own development and form ties with smaller members of the radio industry, including Zenith and General Electric, to promote his invention. Armstrong thought that FM had the potential to replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the Great Depression. Making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM capable receivers. In 1936 he published a landmark paper in the Proceedings of the IRE that documented the superior capabilities of using wide band FM. A year later, a paper by Murray G. Crosby in the same journal provided further analysis of the wide band FM characteristics, and introduced the concept of threshold , demonstrating that there is a superior signal to noise ratio when the signal is stronger than a certain level. In June 1936, Armstrong gave a formal presentation of his new system at the US Federal Communications Commission headquarters. For comparison, he played a jazz record using a conventional AM radio, then switched to an FM transmission. A United Press correspondent was present, and recounted in a wire service report that: if the audience of 500 engineers had shut their eyes they would have believed the jazz band was in the same room. There were no extraneous sounds. Moreover, Several engineers said after the demonstration that they consider Dr. Armstrong's invention one of the most important radio developments since the first earphone crystal sets were introduced. Armstrong was quoted as saying he could visualize a time not far distant when the use of ultra high frequency wave bands will play the leading role in all broadcasting , although the article noted that A switchover to the ultra high frequency system would mean the junking of present broadcasting equipment and present receivers in homes, eventually causing the expenditure of billions of dollars. In the late 1930s, as technical advances made it possible to transmit on higher frequencies, the FCC investigated options for increasing the number of broadcasting stations, in addition to ideas for better audio quality, known as high fidelity . In 1937 it introduced what became known as the Apex band, consisting of 75 broadcasting frequencies from 41.02 to 43.98 MHz. As on the standard broadcast band these were AM stations, but with higher quality audio in one example, a frequency response from 20 Hz to 17,000 Hz  1 dB because station separations were 40 kHz instead of the 10 kHz spacings used on the original AM band. Armstrong worked to convince the FCC that a band of FM broadcasting stations would be a superior approach. That year he financed the construction of the first FM radio station, W2XMN at Alpine, New Jersey. FCC engineers had believed that transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther than line of sight distances, limited by the horizon. When operating with 40 kilowatts on 42.8 MHz, the station could be clearly heard 100 miles away, matching the daytime coverage of a full power 50 kilowatt AM station.FCC studies comparing the Apex station transmissions with Armstrong's FM system concluded that his approach was superior. In early 1940, the FCC held hearings on whether to establish a commercial FM service. Following this review, the FCC announced the establishment of an FM band effective January 1, 1941, consisting of forty 200 kHz wide channels on a band from 42 50 MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations. Existing Apex stations were notified that they would not be allowed to operate after January 1, 1941 unless they converted to FM. Although there was interest in the new FM band by station owners, construction restrictions that went into place during WWII limited the growth of the new service. Following the end of WWII, the FCC moved to standardize its frequency allocations. One area of concern was the effects of tropospheric and Sporadic E propagation, which at times reflected station signals over great distances, causing mutual interference. A particularly controversial proposal, spearheaded by RCA, was that the FM band needed to be shifted to higher frequencies to avoid this problem. This reassignment was fiercely opposed as unneeded by Armstrong, but he lost. The FCC made its decision final on June 27, 1945. It allocated 100 FM channels from 88 108 MHz, and assigned the former FM band to 'non government fixed and mobile' , and television channel 1 , now sidestepping the interference concerns. A period of allowing existing FM stations to broadcast on both low and high bands ended at midnight on January 8, 1949, at which time any low band transmitters were shut down, making obsolete 395,000 receivers that had already been purchased by the public for the original band. Although converters allowing low band FM sets to receive high band were manufactured, they ultimately proved to be complicated to install, and often as expensive than buying a new high band set outright.Armstrong felt the FM band reassignment had been inspired primarily by a desire to cause a disruption that would limit FM's ability to challenge the existing radio industry, including RCA's AM radio properties that included the NBC radio network, plus the other major networks including CBS, ABC and Mutual. The change was thought to have been favored by AT T, as the elimination of FM relaying stations would require radio stations to lease wired links from that company. Particularly galling was the FCC assignment of TV channel 1 to the 44 50 MHz segment of the old FM band. Channel 1 was later deleted, since periodic radio propagation would make local TV signals unviewable. Although the FM band shift was an economic setback, there was reason for optimism. A book published in 1946 by Charles A. Siepmann heralded FM stations as Radio's Second Chance . In late 1945, Armstrong contracted with John Orr Young, founding member of the public relations firm Young Rubicam, to conduct a national campaign promoting FM broadcasting, especially by educational institutions. Article placements promoting both Armstrong personally and FM were made with general circulation publications including The Nation, Fortune, The New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, and The Saturday Evening Post.In 1940, RCA offered Armstrong 1,000,000 for a non exclusive, royalty free license to use his FM patents. He refused this offer, because he felt this would be unfair to the other licensed companies, which had to pay 2 royalties on their sales. Over time this impasse with RCA dominated Armstrong's life. RCA countered by conducting its own FM research, eventually developing what it claimed was a non infringing FM system. The corporation encouraged other companies to stop paying royalties to Armstrong. Outraged by this, in 1948 Armstrong filed suit against RCA and the National Broadcasting Company, accusing them of patent infringement and that they had deliberately set out to oppose and impair the value of his invention, for which he requested treble damages. Although he was confident that this suit would be successful and result in a major monetary award, the protracted legal maneuvering that followed eventually began to impair his finances, especially after his primary patents expired in late 1950.  FM radar During World War II, Armstrong turned his attention to investigations of continuous wave FM radar funded by government contracts. Armstrong hoped that the interference fighting characteristic of wide band FM and a narrow receiver bandwidth to reduce noise would increase range. Primary development took place at Armstrong s Alpine, NJ laboratory. A duplicate set of equipment was sent to the U.S. Army s Evans Signal Laboratory. The results of his investigations were inconclusive, the war ended, and the project was dropped by the Army. Under the name Project Diana, the Evans staff took up the possibility of bouncing radar signals off the moon. Calculations showed that standard pulsed radar like the stock SCR 271 would not do the job; higher average power, much wider transmitter pulses, and very narrow receiver bandwidth would be required. They realized that the Armstrong equipment could be modified to accomplish the task. The FM modulator of the transmitter was disabled and the transmitter keyed to produce quarter second CW pulses. The narrow band receiver, which tracked the transmitter frequency, got an incremental tuning control to compensate for the possible 300 Hz Doppler shift on the lunar echoes. They achieved success on 10 January 1946.  Death Bitter and overtaxed by years of litigation and mounting financial problems, Armstrong lashed out at his wife one day with a fireplace poker, striking her on the arm. She left their apartment to stay with her sister.Sometime during the night of January 31 February 1, 1954, Armstrong jumped to his death from a window in his 12 room apartment on the 13th floor of River House in Manhattan, New York City. The New York Times described the contents of his two page suicide note to his wife: he was heartbroken at being unable to see her once again, and expressing deep regret at having hurt her, the dearest thing in his life. The note concluded, God keep you and Lord have mercy on my Soul. David Sarnoff disclaimed any responsibility, telling Carl Dreher directly that I did not kill Armstrong. After his death, a friend of Armstrong estimated that 90 percent of his time was spent on litigation against RCA. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy reported that Armstrong had recently met with one of his investigators, and had been mortally afraid that secret radar discoveries by him and other scientists were being fed to the Communists as fast as they could be developed . Armstrong was buried in Locust Grove Cemetery, Merrimac, Massachusetts.  Legacy Following her husband's death, Marion Armstrong took charge of pursuing his estate's legal cases. In late December 1954, it was announced that through arbitration a settlement of approximately 1,000,000 had been made with RCA. Dana Raymond of Cravath, Swaine Moore in New York served as counsel in that litigation. Marion Armstrong was able to formally establish Armstrong as the inventor of FM following protracted court proceedings over five of his basic FM patents, with a series of successful suits, which lasted until 1967, against other companies that were found guilty of infringement.It was not until the 1960s that FM stations in the United States started to challenge the popularity of the AM band, helped by the development of FM stereo by General Electric, followed by the FCC's FM Non Duplication Rule, which limited large city broadcasters with AM and FM licenses to simulcasting on those two frequencies for only half of their broadcast hours. Armstrong's FM system was also used for communications between NASA and the Apollo program astronauts. A US Postage Stamp was released in his honor in 1983 in a series commemorating American Inventors.Armstrong has been called the most prolific and influential inventor in radio history . The superheterodyne process is still extensively used by radio equipment. Eighty years after its invention, FM technology has started to be supplemented, and in some cases replaced, by more efficient digital technologies. The introduction of digital television eliminated the FM audio channel that had been used by analog television, HD Radio has added digital sub channels to FM band stations, and, in Europe and Pacific Asia, Digital Audio Broadcasting bands have been created that will, in some cases, eliminate existing FM stations altogether. However, FM broadcasting is still used internationally, and remains the dominant system employed for audio broadcasting services.  Personal life  In 1923, combining his love for high places with courtship rituals, Armstrong climbed the WJZ antenna located atop a 20 story building in New York City, where he reportedly did a handstand, and when a witness asked him what motivated him to do these damnfool things , Armstrong replied I do it because the spirit moves me. Armstrong had arranged to have photographs taken, which he had delivered to David Sarnoff's secretary, Marion MacInnis. Armstrong and MacInnis married later that year. Armstrong bought a Hispano Suiza motor car before the wedding, which he kept until his death, and which he drove to Palm Beach, Florida for their honeymoon. A publicity photograph was made of him presenting Marion with the world's first portable superheterodyne radio as a wedding gift.He was an avid tennis player until an injury in 1940, and drank an Old Fashioned with dinner. Politically, he was described by one of his associates as a revolutionist only in technology in politics he was one of the most conservative of men. In 1955, Marion Armstrong founded the Armstrong Memorial Research Foundation, and participated in its work until her death in 1979 at the age of 81. She was survived by two nephews and a niece.Among Armstrong's living relatives are Steven McGrath, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, formerly energy advisor to Maine's Governor, and Adam Brecht, a media executive in New York City, whose paternal great grandfather, John Frank MacInnis, was the brother of Marion Armstrong. Edwin Howard Armstrong's niece, Jeanne Hammond, who represented the family in the Ken Burns documentary Empire of the Air , died on May 1, 2019 in Scarborough, Maine. Ms. Hammond worked in her uncle's radio laboratory at Columbia University for several years following her graduation from Wellesley College in 1943.  Honors  In 1917, Armstrong was the first recipient of the IRE's Medal of Honor.For his wartime work on radio, the French government gave him the Legion of Honor in 1919. He was awarded the 1941 Franklin Medal, and in 1942 received the AIEEs Edison Medal for distinguished contributions to the art of electric communication, notably the regenerative circuit, the superheterodyne, and frequency modulation. The ITU added him to its roster of great inventors of electricity in 1955. He later received two honorary doctorates, from Columbia in 1929, and Muhlenberg College in 1941.In 1980, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and appeared on a U.S. postage stamp in 1983. The Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame inducted him in 2000, in recognition of his contributions and pioneering spirit that have laid the foundation for consumer electronics. Columbia University established the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professorship in the School of Engineering and Applied Science in his memory.Philosophy Hall, the Columbia building where Armstrong developed FM, was declared a National Historic Landmark. Armstrong's boyhood home in Yonkers, New York was recognized by the National Historic Landmark program and the National Register of Historic Places, although this was withdrawn when the house was demolished.Armstrong Hall at Columbia was named in his honor. The hall, located at the northeast corner of Broadway and 112th Street, was originally an apartment house but was converted to research space after being purchased by the university. It is currently home to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a research institute dedicated to atmospheric and climate science that is jointly operated by Columbia and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A storefront in a corner of the building houses Tom's Restaurant, a longtime neighborhood fixture that inspired Susanne Vega's song Tom's Diner and was used for establishing shots for the fictional Monk's diner in the Seinfeld television series. A second Armstrong Hall, also named for the inventor, is located at the United States Army Communications and Electronics Life Cycle Management Command Headquarters at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.

Sources of mechanical energy include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, wind turbines and even hand cranks. The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was invented in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday. Generators provide nearly all of the power for electric power grids. In addition to electromechanical designs, photovoltaic and fuel cell powered generators utilize solar power and hydrogen based fuels, respectively, to generate electrical output. The reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor, and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity; frequently they make acceptable manual generators.  Terminology  Electromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators. Dynamos generate pulsing direct current through the use of a commutator. Alternators generate alternating current.Mechanically a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part: Rotor: The rotating part of an electrical machine. Stator: The stationary part of an electrical machine, which surrounds the rotor.One of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current: Field winding or field magnets: The magnetic field producing component of an electrical machine. The magnetic field of the dynamo or alternator can be provided by either wire windings called field coils or permanent magnets. Electrically excited generators include an excitation system to produce the field flux. A generator using permanent magnets is sometimes called a magneto, or a permanent magnet synchronous generator . Armature: The power producing component of an electrical machine. In a generator, alternator, or dynamo, the armature windings generate the electric current, which provides power to an external circuit.The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator, depending on the design, with the field coil or magnet on the other part.  History Before the connection between magnetism and electricity was discovered, electrostatic generators were invented. They operated on electrostatic principles, by using moving electrically charged belts, plates and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: electrostatic induction or the triboelectric effect. Such generators generated very high voltage and low current. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of insulating machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early X ray tubes, and later in some atomic particle accelerators.  Faraday disk generator  The operating principle of electromagnetic generators was discovered in the years of 1831 1832 by Michael Faraday. The principle, later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor which encircles a varying magnetic flux. He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk; a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. It produced a small DC voltage. This design was inefficient, due to self cancelling counterflows of current in regions of the disk that were not under the influence of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later homopolar generators would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current flow direction. Another disadvantage was that the output voltage was very low, due to the single current path through the magnetic flux. Experimenters found that using multiple turns of wire in a coil could produce higher, more useful voltages. Since the output voltage is proportional to the number of turns, generators could be easily designed to produce any desired voltage by varying the number of turns. Wire windings became a basic feature of all subsequent generator designs.  Jedlik and the self excitation phenomenon  Independently of Faraday, nyos Jedlik started experimenting in 1827 with the electromagnetic rotating devices which he called electromagnetic self rotors. In the prototype of the single pole electric starter both the stationary and the revolving parts were electromagnetic. It was also the discovery of the principle of dynamo self excitation, which replaced permanent magnet designs. He also may have formulated the concept of the dynamo in 1861 but did not patent it as he thought he was not the first to realize this.  Direct current generators  A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces a current which changes direction with each 180 rotation, an alternating current . However many early uses of electricity required direct current . In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the armature winding to the circuit every 180 rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process. It was used by the firm of Elkingtons for commercial electroplating.The modern dynamo, fit for use in industrial applications, was invented independently by Sir Charles Wheatstone, Werner von Siemens and Samuel Alfred Varley. Varley took out a patent on 24 December 1866, while Siemens and Wheatstone both announced their discoveries on 17 January 1867, the latter delivering a paper on his discovery to the Royal Society. The dynamo electric machine employed self powering electromagnetic field coils rather than permanent magnets to create the stator field. Wheatstone's design was similar to Siemens', with the difference that in the Siemens design the stator electromagnets were in series with the rotor, but in Wheatstone's design they were in parallel. The use of electromagnets rather than permanent magnets greatly increased the power output of a dynamo and enabled high power generation for the first time. This invention led directly to the first major industrial uses of electricity. For example, in the 1870s Siemens used electromagnetic dynamos to power electric arc furnaces for the production of metals and other materials. The dynamo machine that was developed consisted of a stationary structure, which provides the magnetic field, and a set of rotating windings which turn within that field. On larger machines the constant magnetic field is provided by one or more electromagnets, which are usually called field coils. Large power generation dynamos are now rarely seen due to the now nearly universal use of alternating current for power distribution. Before the adoption of AC, very large direct current dynamos were the only means of power generation and distribution. AC has come to dominate due to the ability of AC to be easily transformed to and from very high voltages to permit low losses over large distances.  Synchronous generators  Through a series of discoveries, the dynamo was succeeded by many later inventions, especially the AC alternator, which was capable of generating alternating current. It is commonly known to be the Synchronous Generators . The synchronous machines are directly connected to the grid and need to be properly synchronized during startup. Moreover, they are excited with special control to enhance the stability of the power system.Alternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from Michael Faraday's original discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current. Faraday himself built an early alternator. His machine was a rotating rectangle , whose operation was heteropolar each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions.Large two phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, J.E.H. Gordon, in 1882. The first public demonstration of an alternator system was given by William Stanley, Jr., an employee of Westinghouse Electric in 1886.Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti established Ferranti, Thompson and Ince in 1882, to market his Ferranti Thompson Alternator, invented with the help of renowned physicist Lord Kelvin. His early alternators produced frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Ferranti went on to design the Deptford Power Station for the London Electric Supply Corporation in 1887 using an alternating current system. On its completion in 1891, it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high voltage AC power that was then stepped down for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world. After 1891, polyphase alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases. Later alternators were designed for varying alternating current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.  Self excitation  As the requirements for larger scale power generation increased, a new limitation rose: the magnetic fields available from permanent magnets. Diverting a small amount of the power generated by the generator to an electromagnetic field coil allowed the generator to produce substantially more power. This concept was dubbed self excitation. The field coils are connected in series or parallel with the armature winding. When the generator first starts to turn, the small amount of remanent magnetism present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This bootstrap process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to saturation and the generator reaches a steady state power output. Very large power station generators often utilize a separate smaller generator to excite the field coils of the larger. In the event of a severe widespread power outage where islanding of power stations has occurred, the stations may need to perform a black start to excite the fields of their largest generators, in order to restore customer power service.  Specialized types of generator   Direct current  A dynamo uses commutators to produce direct current. It is self excited, i.e. its field electromagnets are powered by the machine's own output. Other types of DC generators use a separate source of direct current to energize their field magnets.  Homopolar generator  A homopolar generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating in a plane perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field. A potential difference is created between the center of the disc and the rim , the electrical polarity depending on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field. It is also known as a unipolar generator, acyclic generator, disk dynamo, or Faraday disc. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage. They are unusual in that they can produce tremendous electric current, some more than a million amperes, because the homopolar generator can be made to have very low internal resistance.  Magnetohydrodynamic generator  A magnetohydrodynamic generator directly extracts electric power from moving hot gases through a magnetic field, without the use of rotating electromagnetic machinery. MHD generators were originally developed because the output of a plasma MHD generator is a flame, well able to heat the boilers of a steam power plant. The first practical design was the AVCO Mk. 25, developed in 1965. The U.S. government funded substantial development, culminating in a 25 MW demonstration plant in 1987. In the Soviet Union from 1972 until the late 1980s, the MHD plant U 25 was in regular utility operation on the Moscow power system with a rating of 25 MW, the largest MHD plant rating in the world at that time. MHD generators operated as a topping cycle are currently less efficient than combined cycle gas turbines.  Alternating current    Induction generator  Induction AC motors may be used as generators, turning mechanical energy into electric current. Induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotor faster than the synchronous speed, giving negative slip. A regular AC asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator, without any internal modifications. Induction generators are useful in applications such as minihydro power plants, wind turbines, or in reducing high pressure gas streams to lower pressure, because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls. They do not require an exciter circuit because the rotating magnetic field is provided by induction from the stator circuit. They also do not require speed governor equipment as they inherently operate at the connected grid frequency. To operate, an induction generator must be excited with a leading voltage; this is usually done by connection to an electrical grid, or sometimes they are self excited by using phase correcting capacitors.  Linear electric generator  In the simplest form of linear electric generator, a sliding magnet moves back and forth through a solenoid a spool of copper wire. An alternating current is induced in the loops of wire by Faraday's law of induction each time the magnet slides through. This type of generator is used in the Faraday flashlight. Larger linear electricity generators are used in wave power schemes.  Variable speed constant frequency generators  Many renewable energy efforts attempt to harvest natural sources of mechanical energy to produce electricity. Because these sources fluctuate in power applied, standard generators using permanent magnets and fixed windings would deliver unregulated voltage and frequency. The overhead of regulation is high in proportion to the naturally derived energy available. New generator designs such as the asynchronous or induction singly fed generator, the doubly fed generator, or the brushless wound rotor doubly fed generator are seeing success in variable speed constant frequency applications, such as wind turbines or other renewable energy technologies. These systems thus offer cost, reliability and efficiency benefits in certain use cases.  Common use cases   Power station  A power station, also referred to as a power plant or powerhouse and sometimes generating station or generating plant, is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power. Most power stations contain one or more generators, a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into three phase electric power. The relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor creates an electric current. The energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely. Most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas to generate electricity. Cleaner sources include nuclear power, and an increasing use of renewables such as solar, wind, wave and hydroelectric.  Vehicular generators   Roadway vehicles  Motor vehicles require electrical energy to power their instrumentation, keep the engine itself operating, and recharge their batteries. Until about the 1960s motor vehicles tended to use DC generators with electromechanical regulators. Following the historical trend above and for many of the same reasons, these have now been replaced by alternators with built in rectifier circuits.  Bicycles  Bicycles require energy to power running lights and other equipment. There are two common kinds of generator in use on bicycles: bottle dynamos which engage the bicycle's tire on an as needed basis, and hub dynamos which are directly attached to the bicycle's drive train. The name is conventional as these they are small permanent magnet alternators, not self excited DC machines as are dynamos. Some electric bicycles are capable of regenerative braking, where the drive motor is used as a generator to recover some energy during braking.  Sailboats  Sailing boats may use a water or wind powered generator to trickle charge the batteries. A small propeller, wind turbine or turbine is connected to a low power generator to supply currents at typical wind or cruising speeds.  Electric scooters  Electric scooters with regenerative braking have become popular all over the world. Engineers use kinetic energy recovery systems on the scooter to reduce energy consumption and increase its range up to 40 60 by simply recovering energy using the magnetic brake, which generates electric energy for further use. Modern vehicles reach speed up to 25 30 km h and can run up to 35 40 km.  Genset  An engine generator is the combination of an electrical generator and an engine mounted together to form a single piece of self contained equipment. The engines used are usually piston engines, but gas turbines can also be used, and there are even hybrid diesel gas units, called dual fuel units. Many different versions of engine generators are available ranging from very small portable petrol powered sets to large turbine installations. The primary advantage of engine generators is the ability to independently supply electricity, allowing the units to serve as backup power solutions.  Human powered electrical generators  A generator can also be driven by human muscle power . Human powered electric generators are commercially available, and have been the project of some DIY enthusiasts. Typically operated by means of pedal power, a converted bicycle trainer, or a foot pump, such generators can be practically used to charge batteries, and in some cases are designed with an integral inverter. An average healthy human can produce a steady 75 watts for a full eight hour period, while a first class athlete can produce approximately 298 watts for a similar period. At the end of which an undetermined period of rest and recovery will be required. At 298 watts the average healthy human becomes exhausted within 10 minutes. The net electrical power that can be produced will be less, due to the efficiency of the generator. Portable radio receivers with a crank are made to reduce battery purchase requirements, see clockwork radio. During the mid 20th century, pedal powered radios were used throughout the Australian outback, to provide schooling , medical and other needs in remote stations and towns.  Mechanical measurement  A tachogenerator is an electromechanical device which produces an output voltage proportional to its shaft speed. It may be used for a speed indicator or in a feedback speed control system. Tachogenerators are frequently used to power tachometers to measure the speeds of electric motors, engines, and the equipment they power. Generators generate voltage roughly proportional to shaft speed. With precise construction and design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft speeds.  Equivalent circuit  An equivalent circuit of a generator and load is shown in the adjacent diagram. The generator is represented by an abstract generator consisting of an ideal voltage source and an internal impedance. The generator's         V      G          displaystyle V text G  and         R      G          displaystyle R text G  parameters can be determined by measuring the winding resistance , and measuring the open circuit and loaded voltage for a defined current load. This is the simplest model of a generator, further elements may need to be added for an accurate representation. In particular, inductance can be added to allow for the machine's windings and magnetic leakage flux, but a full representation can become much more complex than this.  See also   References",

            "text": "The electric power industry covers the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric power to the general public and industry. The commodity sold is actually energy, not power, e.g. consumers pay for kilowatt hours, power multiplied by time, which is energy. The commercial distribution of electricity started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. What was once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements of developed economies. By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a natural monopoly , only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure. Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find.  History  Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the United States, Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed direct current electricity. Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the Sussex town of Brighton in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched. In early 1882, Edison opened the world's first steam powered electricity generating station at Holborn Viaduct in London, where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current . Whilst the Godalming and the 1882 Holborn Viaduct Scheme closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day. It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the Pearl Street Power Station in New York City and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the danger from direct contact and increases the required insulation thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.The mid to late 1880s saw the introduction of alternating current systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the war of the currents. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out. The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as George Westinghouse with Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky, Galileo Ferraris, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, William Stanley Jr., Nikola Tesla, and others contributed to this field. Power electronics is the application of solid state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier in 1902, used to convert AC into DC. From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Grading electrodes made them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933, selenium rectifiers were invented. Transistor technology dates back to 1947, with the invention of the point contact transistor, which was followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier was introduced, increasing the range of power electronic applications.A breakthrough in power electronics came with the invention of the MOSFET in 1959. Generations of MOSFETs enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS . The power MOSFET has since become the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair.While HVDC is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent asynchronous power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.  Organization  The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are electricity generation such as a power station, electric power transmission, electricity distribution and electricity retailing. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a natural monopoly. The industry is generally heavily regulated, often with price controls and is frequently government owned and operated. However, the modern trend has been growing deregulation in at least the latter two processes.The nature and state of market reform of the electricity market often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end users of electricity may opt for more costly green electricity.  Generation  All forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects. Technology will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a market economy, the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources. It is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity. There are indications that renewable energy is rapidly becoming the most viable in economic terms. A diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes.  Electric power transmission  Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the power grid in North America, or just the grid . In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia and New Zealand, the network is known as the National Grid. A wide area synchronous grid, also known as an interconnection in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative frequency numerous consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America grid . In Europe one large grid connects most of continental Europe. Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.  Electric power distribution  Electric power distribution is the final stage in the delivery of electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. Primary distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through secondary distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.  Electric retailing  Electricity retailing is the final sale of electricity from generation to the end use consumer.  World electricity industries  The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country. In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization. Other regions have private or investor owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, cooperative companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system. Not everyone has access to grid electricity. About 840 million people had no access in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.  Market reform The business model behind the electric utility has changed over the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990.  United States  In 1996 1999 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission made a series of decisions which were intended to open the U.S. wholesale power market to new players, with the hope that spurring competition would save consumers 4 to 5 billion per year and encourage technical innovation in the industry. Steps were taken to give all market participants open access to existing interstate transmission lines.  Order No. 888 ordered vertically integrated electric utilities to functionally separate their transmission, power generation and marketing businesses to prevent self dealing. Order No. 889 set up a system to provide all participants with timely access to information about available transmission capacity and prices. The FERC also endorsed the concept of appointing independent system operators to manage the electric power grid a function that was traditionally the responsibility of vertically integrated electric utility companies. The concept of an independent system operator evolved into that of regional transmission organizations . FERC's intention was that all U.S. companies owning interstate electric transmission lines would place those facilities under the control of an RTO. In its Order No. 2000 , issued in 1999, FERC specified the minimum capabilities that an RTO should possess.These decisions, which were intended to create a fully interconnected grid and an integrated national power market, resulted in the restructuring of the U.S. electricity industry. That process was soon dealt two setbacks: the California energy crisis of 2000, and the Enron scandal and collapse. Although industry restructuring proceeded, these events made clear that competitive markets could be manipulated and thus must be properly designed and monitored. Furthermore, the Northeast blackout of 2003 highlighted the need for a dual focus on competitive pricing and strong reliability standards.  Other countries  In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK's National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought several electric utilities in New England for 3.2 billion. Between 1995 and 1997, seven of the 12 Regional Electric Companies in England and Wales were bought by U.S. energy companies. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; solar engineering and photovoltaic systems; off shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.  Outlook Electricity is expected to see growing demand in the future. The Information Revolution is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, industrial processes, and transportation .  See also   References   Further reading P.

            "text": "Elihu Thomson was an English born American engineer and inventor who was instrumental in the founding of major electrical companies in the United States, the United Kingdom and France.  Early life He was born in Manchester, England, on March 29, 1853, but his family moved to Philadelphia in the United States in 1858. Thomson attended Central High School in Philadelphia and graduated in 1870. Thomson took a teaching position at Central, and in 1876, at the age of twenty three, held the chair of Chemistry. In 1880, he left Central to pursue research in the emerging field of electrical engineering.  Electrical innovations With Edwin J. Houston, a former teacher and later colleague of Thomson's at Central High School, Thomson founded the Thomson Houston Electric Company. Notable inventions created by Thomson during this period include an arc lighting system, an automatically regulated three coil dynamo, a magnetic lightning arrester, and a local power transformer. In 1892 the Thomson Houston Electric Company merged with the Edison General Electric Company to become the General Electric Company.The historian Thomas P. Hughes writes that Thomson displayed methodological characteristics in the workshop and the laboratory as an inventor and in the business world as an entrepreneur. He also chose to solve problems in the rapidly expanding field of electric light and power. Thomson's name is further commemorated by the British Thomson Houston Company , and the French companies Thomson SA and Alstom . Thomson was notable both for his emphasis on models and for the singular focus with which he pursued his research, with Thomson referring to his workshop as a model room rather than a laboratory. Between 1880 and 1885, Thomson averaged twenty one patent applications annually, doubling that average between 1885 and 1890. Upon the merger of Thomson Houston Electric Company to form General Electric in 1892, Thomson chose to keep his laboratory at Lynn, Massachusetts near Boston away from GE's New York headquarters to ensure his control over his research. At the Lynn GE plant, he worked with Edwin Rice and Sanford Moss and Charles Steinmetz . After being asked to become a director of GE, Thomson rejected the offer preferring continued research to management.  Honors Thomson was the first recipient of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers AIEE Edison Medal, bestowed upon him in 1909 For meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto during the past thirty years. ; Thomson was also president of the organization from 1889 90. Near the end of his life, Thomson's second wife Clarissa Hovey Thomson is reported to have said that she had to carry a basket with her to carry all of Thomson's awards and honors.He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1876.In 1889 he was decorated by the French Government for his electrical inventions, being made Chevalier et Officier de la L gion d'honneur. He received the honorary degree of A.M. from Yale . Tufts College in 1892 gave him the degree of Ph.D., and in 1899 he received a D.Sc. from Harvard.  Later life He was a founding member, as well as the second president, of the International Electrotechnical Commission. He served as acting president of MIT from 1920 1923. Thomson, overcoming his distaste for management, accepted this role during a critical period for the university when it could not otherwise find a president.On June 21, 1932, at age 79, Thomson was interviewed on film talking about his life and times.Thomson died at his estate in Swampscott, Massachusetts. The Elihu Thomson House in Swampscott was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976 and serves as Swampscott's town hall.  Patents Thomson held more than 700 patents. Thomson used his patents to bolster his company, Thomson Houston Company, later General Electric.  Personal life He married Mary Louise Peck on May 1, 1884.

            "text": "Elisha Gray was an American electrical engineer who co founded the Western Electric Manufacturing Company. Gray is best known for his development of a telephone prototype in 1876 in Highland Park, Illinois. Some recent authors have argued that Gray should be considered the true inventor of the telephone because Alexander Graham Bell allegedly stole the idea of the liquid transmitter from him. Although Gray had been using liquid transmitters in his telephone experiments for more than two years previously, Bell's telephone patent was upheld in numerous court decisions. Gray is also considered to be the father of the modern music synthesizer, and was granted over 70 patents for his inventions. He was one of the founders of Graybar, purchasing a controlling interest in the company shortly after its inception.  Biography and early inventions Gray was born in Barnesville, Ohio, the son of Christiana and David Gray. His family were Quakers. He was brought up on a farm. He spent several years at Oberlin College where he experimented with electrical devices. Although Gray did not graduate, he taught electricity and science there and built laboratory equipment for its science departments. In 1862, while at Oberlin, Gray met and married Delia Minerva Shepard. In 1865, Gray invented a self adjusting telegraph relay that automatically adapted to varying insulation of the telegraph line. In 1867 Gray received a patent for the invention, the first of more than seventy. In 1869, Elisha Gray and his partner Enos M. Barton founded Gray Barton Co. in Cleveland, Ohio to supply telegraph equipment to the giant Western Union Telegraph Company. The electrical distribution business was later spun off and organized into a separate company, Graybar Electric Company, Inc. Barton was employed by Western Union to examine and test new products. In 1870, financing for Gray Barton Co. was arranged by General Anson Stager, a superintendent of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Stager became an active partner in Gray Barton Co. and remained on the board of directors. The company moved to Chicago near Highland Park. Gray later gave up his administrative position as chief engineer to focus on inventions that could benefit the telegraph industry. Gray's inventions and patent costs were financed by a dentist, Dr. Samuel S. White of Philadelphia, who had made a fortune producing porcelain teeth. White wanted Gray to focus on the acoustic telegraph which promised huge profits instead of what appeared to be unpromising competing inventions such as the telephone. White made the decision in 1876 to redirect Gray's interest in the telephone. In 1870, Gray developed a needle annunciator for hotels and another for elevators. He also developed a microphone printer which had a typewriter keyboard and printed messages on paper tape.In 1871 Great Chicago Fire destroyed the city and it's telegraph infrastructure, Gray Barton was hired to rebuild it. In 1872, Western Union, then financed by the Vanderbilts and J. P. Morgan, bought one third of Gray and Barton Co. and changed the name to Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago. Gray continued to invent for Western Electric. In 1874, Gray retired to do independent research and development. Gray applied for a patent on a harmonic telegraph which consisted of multi tone transmitters, that controlled each tone with a separate telegraph key. Gray gave several private demonstrations of this invention in New York and Washington, D.C. in May and June 1874. Gray was a charter member of the Presbyterian Church in Highland Park, Illinois. At the church, on December 29, 1874, Gray gave the first public demonstration of his invention for transmitting musical tones and transmitted familiar melodies through telegraph wire according to a newspaper announcement. This was one of the earliest electric musical instruments using vibrating electromagnetic circuits that were single note oscillators operated by a two octave piano keyboard. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were created by electromagnets and transmitted over a telegraph wire. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator tones audible and louder at the receiving end. In 1900 Gray worked on an underwater signaling device. After his death in 1901 officials gave the invention to Oberlin College. A few years later he was recognized as the inventor of the underwater signaling device. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. Patent 166,095 for Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones . His experiments with transmitting musical tones went further, and on February 15, 1876 Elisha Grey was granted US Patent for electro harmonic telegraph with piano keyboard.He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1878.  Telephone  Because of Samuel White's opposition to Gray working on the telephone, Gray did not tell anybody about his invention for transmitting voice sounds until February 11, 1876 . The only remaining proof is a drawing he made on that day. Gray requested that his patent lawyer William D. Baldwin prepare a caveat for filing at the US Patent Office. A caveat was like a provisional patent application with drawings and description but without a request for examination. On Monday morning February 14, 1876, Gray signed and had notarized the caveat that described a telephone that used a liquid transmitter. Baldwin then submitted the caveat to the US Patent Office. That same morning a lawyer for Alexander Graham Bell submitted Bell's patent application. Which application arrived first is hotly disputed, although Gray believed that his caveat arrived a few hours before Bell's application. Bell's lawyers in Washington, DC, had been waiting with Bell's patent application for months, under instructions not to file it in the USA until it had been filed in Britain first. According to Evenson, during the weekend of February 12 14, 1876, before either caveat or application had been filed in the patent office, Bell's lawyer learned about the liquid transmitter idea in Gray's caveat that would be filed early Monday morning February 14. Bell's lawyer then added seven sentences describing the liquid transmitter and a variable resistance claim to Bell's draft application. After the lawyer's clerk recopied the draft as a finished patent application, Bell's lawyer hand delivered the finished application to the patent office just before noon Monday, a few hours after Gray's caveat was delivered by Gray's lawyer. Bell's lawyer requested that Bell's application be immediately recorded and hand delivered to the examiner on Monday so that later Bell could claim it had arrived first. Bell was in Boston at this time and was not aware that his application had been filed.Five days later, on February 19, Zenas Fisk Wilber, the patent examiner for both Bell's application and Gray's caveat, noticed that Bell's application claimed the same variable resistance feature described in Gray's caveat. Wilber suspended Bell's application for 90 days to give Gray time to submit a competing patent application. The suspension also gave Bell time to amend his claims to avoid an interference with an earlier patent application of Gray's that mentioned changing the intensity of the electric current without breaking the circuit, which seemed to the examiner to be an undulatory current that Bell was claiming. Such an interference would delay Bell's application until Bell submitted proof, under the first to invent rules, that Bell had invented that feature before Gray. Bell's lawyer telegraphed Bell, who was still in Boston, to come to Washington, DC. When Bell arrived on February 26, Bell visited his lawyers and then visited examiner Wilber who told Bell that Gray's caveat showed a liquid transmitter and asked Bell for proof that the liquid transmitter idea was invented by Bell. Bell pointed to an application of Bell's filed a year earlier where mercury was used in a circuit breaker. The examiner accepted this argument, although mercury would not have worked in a telephone transmitter. On February 29, Bell's lawyer submitted an amendment to Bell's claims that distinguished them from Gray's caveat and Gray's earlier application. On March 3, Wilber approved Bell's application and on March 7, 1876, 174,465 was published by the U.S. Patent Office.Bell returned to Boston and resumed work on March 9, drawing a diagram in his lab notebook of a water transmitter being used face down, very similar to that shown in Gray's caveat. Bell and Watson built and tested a liquid transmitter design on March 10 and successfully transmitted clear speech saying Mr. Watson come here I want to see you. Bell's notebooks became public when they were donated to the Library of Congress in 1976.Although Bell has been accused of stealing the telephone from Gray because his liquid transmitter design resembled Gray's, documents in the Library of Congress indicate that Bell had been using liquid transmitters extensively for three years in his multiple telegraph and other experiments. In April, 1875, ten months before the alleged theft of Gray's design, the U.S. Patent Office granted 161,739 to Bell for a primitive fax machine, which he called the autograph telegraph. The patent drawing includes liquid transmitters.After March 1876, Bell and Watson focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.Although Gray had abandoned his caveat, Gray applied for a patent for the same invention in late 1877. This put him in a second interference with Bell's patents. The Patent Office determined, while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the variable resistance invention, as in his caveat of February 14, 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered. Gray challenged Bell's patent anyway, and after two years of litigation, Bell was awarded rights to the invention, and as a result, Bell is credited as the inventor. In 1886, Wilber stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic and deeply in debt to Bell's lawyer Marcellus Bailey with whom Wilber had served in the Civil War. Wilber stated that, contrary to Patent Office rules, he showed Bailey the caveat Gray had filed. He also stated that he showed the caveat to Bell and Bell gave him 100. Bell testified that they only discussed the patent in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Wilbur's affidavit contradicted his earlier testimony, and historians have pointed out that his last affidavit was drafted for him by the attorneys for the Pan Electric Company which was attempting to steal the Bell patents and was later discovered to have bribed the U.S. Attorney General Augustus Garland and several Congressmen. Bell's patent was disputed in 1888 by attorney Lysander Hill who accused Wilber of allowing Bell or his lawyer Pollok to add a handwritten margin note of seven sentences to Bell's application that describe an alternate design similar to Gray's liquid microphone design. However, the marginal note was added only to Bell's earlier draft, not to his patent application that shows the seven sentences already present in a paragraph. Bell testified that he added those seven sentences in the margin of an earlier draft of his application almost at the last moment before sending it off to Washington to his lawyers. Bell or his lawyer could not have added the seven sentences to the application after it was filed in the Patent Office, because then the application would not have been suspended.  Further inventions In 1887, Gray invented the telautograph, a device that could remotely transmit handwriting through telegraph systems. Gray was granted several patents for these pioneer fax machines, and the Gray National Telautograph Company was chartered in 1888 and continued in business as The Telautograph Corporation for many years; after a series of mergers it was finally absorbed by Xerox in the 1990s. Gray's telautograph machines were used by banks for signing documents at a distance and by the military for sending written commands during gun tests when the deafening noise from the guns made spoken orders on the telephone impractical. The machines were also used at train stations for schedule changes.Gray displayed his telautograph invention in 1893 at the 1893 Columbian Exposition and sold his share in the telautograph shortly after that. Gray was also chairman of the International Congress of Electricians at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. Gray conceived of a primitive closed circuit television system that he called the telephone . Pictures would be focused on an array of selenium cells and signals from the selenium cells would be transmitted to a distant station on separate wires. At the receiving end, each wire would open or close a shutter to recreate the image. In 1899, Gray moved to Boston where he continued inventing. One of his projects was to develop an underwater signaling device to transmit messages to ships. One such signaling device was tested on December 31, 1900. Three weeks later, on January 21, 1901, Gray died from a heart attack in Newtonville, Massachusetts. Some modern authors incorrectly attribute the Gray code to Elisha Gray, whereas it was named after Frank Gray.  Publications Gray wrote several books including: Experimental Researches in Electro Harmonic Telegraphy and Telephony, 1867 1876 Telegraphy and Telephony Electricity and Magnetism and Nature's Miracles a nontechnical discussion of science and technology for the general public.

            "text": "Emile Berliner originally Emil Berliner, was a German American inventor. He is best known for inventing the lateral cut flat disc record used with a gramophone. He founded the United States Gramophone Company in 1894; The Gramophone Company in London, England, in 1897; Deutsche Grammophon in Hanover, Germany, in 1898; and Berliner Gram o phone Company of Canada in Montreal in 1899 .  Early life Berliner was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1851 into a Jewish merchant family. Though Jewish, his religious persuasion would develop into agnosticism. He completed an apprenticeship to become a merchant, as was family tradition. While his real hobby was invention, he worked as an accountant to make ends meet. To avoid being drafted for the Franco Prussian War, Berliner migrated to the United States of America in 1870 with a friend of his father's, in whose shop he worked in Washington, D.C. He moved to New York and, living off temporary work, such as doing the paper route and cleaning bottles, he studied physics at night at the Cooper Union Institute.  Career After some time working in a livery stable, he became interested in the new audio technology of the telephone and phonograph, and invented an improved telephone transmitter . The patent was acquired by the Bell Telephone Company . In America, Thomas Edison and Berliner fought a long legal battle over the patent rights. On February 27, 1901, the United States Court of Appeals declared Berliner's patent void and awarded Edison full rights to the invention, stating Edison preceded Berliner in the transmission of speech ... The use of carbon in a transmitter is, beyond controversy, the invention of Edison and the patent was ruled invalid. Berliner subsequently moved to Boston in 1877 and worked for Bell Telephone until 1883, when he returned to Washington and established himself as a private researcher. Emile Berliner became a United States citizen in 1881. Berliner also invented what was probably the first radial aircraft engine , a helicopter , and acoustical tiles . In 1886 Berliner began experimenting with methods of sound recording and reproduction. He was granted his first patent for what he called the Gramophone in 1887. The patent described recording sound using horizontal modulation of a stylus as it traced a line on a rotating cylindrical surface coated with an unresisting opaque material such as lampblack, subsequently fixed with varnish and used to photoengrave a corresponding groove into the surface of a metal playback cylinder. In practice, Berliner opted for the disc format, which made the photoengraving step much less difficult and offered the prospect of making multiple copies of the result by some simpler process such as electrotyping, molding or stamping. In 1888 Berliner was using a more direct recording method, in which the stylus traced a line through a very thin coating of wax on a zinc disc, which was then etched in acid to convert the line of bared metal into a playable groove. By 1890 a Berliner licensee in Germany was manufacturing a toy Gramophone and five inch hard rubber discs , but because key U.S. patents were still pending they were sold only in Europe. Berliner meant his Gramophone to be more than a mere toy, and in 1894 he persuaded a group of businessmen to invest 25,000, with which he started the United States Gramophone Company. He began marketing seven inch records and a more substantial Gramophone, which was, however, still hand propelled like the smaller toy machine.The difficulty in using early hand driven Gramophones was getting the turntable to rotate at an acceptably steady speed while playing a disc. Engineer Eldridge R. Johnson, the owner of a small machine shop in Camden, New Jersey, assisted Berliner in developing a suitable low cost wind up spring motor for the Gramophone and became Berliner's manufacturer. Berliner gave Frank Seaman the exclusive sales rights in the U.S., but after disagreements Seaman began selling his own version of the Gramophone, as well as unauthorized copies of Berliner's records, and Berliner was legally barred from selling his own products. The U.S. Berliner Gramophone Company shut down in mid 1900 and Berliner moved to Canada. Following various legal maneuvers, the Victor Talking Machine Company was officially founded by Eldridge Johnson in 1901 and the trade name Gramophone was completely and permanently abandoned in the U.S., although its use continued elsewhere. The Berliner Gramophone Co. of Canada was chartered on 8 April 1904 and reorganized as the Berliner Gramophone Co. in 1909 in Montreal's Saint Henri district.  The Gramophone  The Gramophone was presented as an apparatus for making permanent records of the human voice or other sounds, including music of all kinds and for reproducing the same at any time thereafter as often as desired. The records were of hard rubber, solid metal or other indestructible material and could, therefore, be handled without fear of breaking or injuring them. The sound records were grooves of even depth, but of varying direction, as opposed to those of straight lines and various depths in the Phonograph and Graphophone. These records could be multiplied at will to any extent, and each copy would sound precisely like the original.It was based on the Leon Scott Phonautograph, which was invented nearly forty years before, and which traced sound as curvilinear lines upon the smoked surface of a brass cylinder by means of a diaphragm with a stylus attached to its center. Early in 1877, or six months before the discovery of the phonograph principle by indenting tin foil or wax, Charles Cros, of Paris, had conceived and placed on file the theory that if the curvilinear record of a Scott Phonautograph be photo engraved, and such an engraving be made to act again on a stylus attached to a diaphragm, the original sound would be reproduced with absolute accuracy. This was the first conception of a sound reproducing machine. Cros, however, did not put this idea into practical operation, presumably on account of the many technical difficulties which had to be overcome in order to accomplish it.Emile Berliner undertook to reproduce the human voice on a similar principle, and after much study and experimenting, secured fundamental patents covering the general process and its essential details. In his machine, which he called The Gramophone the voice was first traced in curvilinear lines as in the Scott machine, but on a metal plate covered with a very delicate layer of fatty etching ground, and the lines were then etched in to the metal plate by immersing the same in acid. From this faithfully etched record the voice could readily be reproduced, and copied at will by electrotyping or other modes of multiplying. Future generations will be able to condense into the brief space of twenty minutes the tone pictures of a lifetime five minutes of childish prattle, five moments embalming the last feeble utterrances from the death bed. Will this not seem like holding veritable communion with immortality?  Other inventions  Berliner's other inventions include a new type of loom for mass production of cloth; an acoustic tile; and an early version of the helicopter. According to a July 1, 1909, report in The New York Times, a helicopter built by Berliner and J. Newton Williams of Derby, Connecticut, had lifted its operator from the ground on three occasions at Berliner's laboratory in the Brightwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C.Between 1907 and 1926, Berliner dedicated himself to improving the technologies of vertical flight through the development of a light weight rotary engine, which he improved upon throughout the 1910s and 1920s. With R.S. Moore, also a Scientist and Inventor, as his chief assistant, Berliner obtained automobile engines from the Adams Company in Dubuque, Iowa, manufacturer of the Adams Farwell automobile. This car used air cooled three or five cylinder rotary engines, which were developed in house by Fay Oliver Farwell . Berliner and Farwell adapted them for use in perfecting machines produced for vertical flight. His realizations allowed him to move away from the heavy in line engines to lighter rotary models, which led to the invention of a 6 hp rotary engine for the improvement of vertical flight. It was these experiments that led to the formal creation of the Gyro Motor Company in 1909 and it was the creation of the 6 hp rotary engine that initiated the use of rotary engines in aviation. The Gyro Motor Company manufactured these and other improved versions of the Gyro Engine between 1909 and roughly 1926. The building used for these operations exists at 774 Girard Street, NW, Washington, D.C., where its principal facade is in the Fairmont Girard alleyway. By 1910, continuing to advance vertical flight, Berliner experimented with the use of a vertically mounted tail rotor to counteract torque on his single main rotor design. It was this configuration that led to the mechanical development of practical helicopters of the 1940s. When the Gyro Motor Company opened, Spencer Heath , a mechanical engineer , became the manager. Heath was connected with the American Propeller Manufacturing Company, also a manufacturer of aeronautical related mechanisms and products in Baltimore, Maryland. Both R.S. Moore, Designer and Engineer, and Joseph Sanders , inventor, engineer, and manufacturer, were involved in the original operations of the company. Berliner was president of the newly founded Gyro Motor Company and much of his time was spent dealing with business operations.On June 16, 1922, Berliner and his son, Henry, demonstrated a working helicopter for the United States Army. Henry became disillusioned with helicopters in 1925, and in 1926 founded the Berliner Aircraft Company, which merged to become Berliner Joyce Aircraft in 1929.Berliner, who suffered a nervous breakdown in 1914, was also active in advocating improvements in public health and sanitation. He also advocated for women's equality and, in 1908, established the scholarship program, Sarah Berliner Research Fellowship, in honor of his mother. Berliner also supported and advocated Zionism.  Awards Berliner was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Scott Medal in 1897, and later the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1913 and the Franklin Medal in 1929.  Death On August 3, 1929, Berliner died of a heart attack at his home at the Wardman Park Hotel in Washington D.C., at the age of 78. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., alongside his wife and a son, Herbert Samuel Berliner.

            "text": "The Empire State Building is a 102 story Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from Empire State , the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet and stands a total of 1,454 feet tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building until the construction of the World Trade Center in 1970; following the latter's collapse in 2001, the Empire State Building reverted to being the city's tallest skyscraper until that title was surpassed in 2012. As of 2022, the building is the seventh tallest building in New York City, the ninth tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, the 54th tallest in the world, and the sixth tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. The site of the Empire State Building, in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s. The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film King Kong was released in 1933. The building's size has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.  Site The Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, between 33rd Street to the south and 34th Street to the north. Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at 350 Fifth Avenue. Visitors to the observatories use an entrance at 20 West 34th Street; prior to August 2018, visitors entered through the Fifth Avenue lobby. Although physically located in South Midtown, a mixed residential and commercial area, the building is so large that it was assigned its own ZIP Code, 10118; as of 2012, it is one of 43 buildings in New York City that have their own ZIP codes.The areas surrounding the Empire State Building are home to other major points of interest, including Macy's at Herald Square on Sixth Avenue and 34th Street, and Koreatown on 32nd Street between Madison and Sixth Avenues. To the east of the Empire State Building is Murray Hill, a neighborhood with a mix of residential, commercial, and entertainment activity. The block directly to the northeast contains the B. Altman and Company Building, which houses the City University of New York's Graduate Center, while the Demarest Building is directly across Fifth Avenue to the east. The nearest New York City Subway stations are 34th Street Herald Square, one block west, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue, two blocks east; there is also a PATH station at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue.  Architecture The Empire State Building was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the Art Deco style. The Empire State Building is 1,250 ft tall to its 102nd floor, or 1,453 feet 8 9 16 inches including its 203 foot pinnacle. It was the first building in the world to be more than 100 stories tall, though only the lowest 86 stories are usable. The first through 85th floors contain 2.158 million square feet of commercial and office space, while the 86th story contains an observatory. The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes. Atop the 102nd story is the 203 ft pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.The building has been named one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and confirmed by the New York City Board of Estimate. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 2007, it was first on the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.  Form  The Empire State Building has a symmetrical massing because of its large lot and relatively short base. Its articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The five story base occupies the entire lot, while the 81 story shaft above it is set back sharply from the base. The setback above the 5th story is 60 feet deep on all sides. There are smaller setbacks on the upper stories, allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors while also positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below. The setbacks are located at the 21st, 25th, 30th, 72nd, 81st, and 85th stories. The setbacks correspond to the tops of elevator shafts, allowing interior spaces to be at most 28 feet deep .The setbacks were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well. Normally, a building of the Empire State's dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd 34th Streets side, before it would have to utilize setbacks. However, with the largest setback being located above the base, the tower stories could contain a uniform shape. According to architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern, the building's form contrasted with the nearly contemporary, similarly designed 500 Fifth Avenue eight blocks north, which had an asymmetrical massing on a smaller lot.  Facade  The Empire State Building's Art Deco design is typical of pre World War II architecture in New York City. The facade is clad in Indiana limestone panels sourced from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana, which give the building its signature blonde color. According to official fact sheets, the facade uses 200,000 cubic feet of limestone and granite, ten million bricks, and 730 short tons of aluminum and stainless steel. The building also contains 6,514 windows. The decorative features on the facade are largely geometric, in contrast with earlier buildings, whose decorations often were intended to represent a specific narrative. The main entrance, composed of three sets of metal doors, is at the center of the facade's Fifth Avenue elevation, flanked by molded piers that are topped with eagles. Above the main entrance is a transom, a triple height transom window with geometric patterns, and the golden letters Empire State above the fifth floor windows. There are two entrances each on 33rd and 34th Streets, with modernistic, stainless steel canopies projecting from the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets there. Above the secondary entrances are triple windows, less elaborate in design than those on Fifth Avenue.The storefronts on the first floor contain aluminum framed doors and windows within a black granite cladding. The second through fourth stories consist of windows alternating with wide stone piers and narrower stone mullions. The fifth story contains windows alternating with wide and narrow mullions, and is topped by a horizontal stone sill.The facade of the tower stories is split into several vertical bays on each side, with windows projecting slightly from the limestone cladding. The bays are arranged into sets of one, two, or three windows on each floor. The bays are separated by alternating narrow and wide piers, the inclusion of which may have been influenced by the design of the contemporary Daily News Building. The windows in each bay are separated by vertical nickel chrome steel mullions and connected by horizontal aluminum spandrels between each floor. The windows are placed within stainless steel frames, which eliminated the need to saved money by removing the need to apply a stone finish around the windows. In addition, the use of aluminum spandrels obviated the need for cross bonding, which would have been required if stone had been used instead.  Lights  The building was originally equipped with white searchlights at the top. They were first used in November 1932 when they lit up to signal Roosevelt's victory over Hoover in the presidential election of that year. These were later swapped for four Freedom Lights in 1956. In February 1964, flood lights were added on the 72nd floor to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the World Fair later that year. The lights were shut off from November 1973 to July 1974 because of the energy crisis at the time. In 1976, the businessman Douglas Leigh suggested that Wien and Helmsley install 204 metal halide lights, which were four times as bright as the 1,000 incandescent lights they were to replace. New red, white, and blue metal halide lights were installed in time for the country's bicentennial that July. After the bicentennial, Helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost, about 116 a year.Since October 12, 1977, the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays. Organizations are allowed to make requests through the building's website. The building is also lit in the colors of New York based sports teams on nights when they host games: for example, orange, blue, and white for the New York Knicks; red, white, and blue for the New York Rangers. The spire can also be lit to commemorate events including disasters, anniversaries, or deaths, as well as for celebrations such as Pride and Halloween. In 1998, the building was lit in blue after the death of singer Frank Sinatra, who was nicknamed Ol' Blue Eyes . The structure was lit in red, white, and blue for several months after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. On January 13, 2012, the building was lit in red, orange, and yellow to honor the 60th anniversary of NBC program The Today Show. After retired basketball player Kobe Bryant's January 2020 death, the building was lit in purple and gold, signifying the colors of his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.In 2012, the building's four hundred metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with 1,200 LED fixtures, increasing the available colors from nine to over 16 million. The computer controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, CNN used the top of the Empire State Building as a scoreboard during the 2012 United States presidential election, using red and blue lights to represent Republican and Democratic electoral votes respectively. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. Artists such as Eminem and OneRepublic have been featured in later shows, including the building's annual Holiday Music to Lights Show. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they do not use the lights to play advertisements.  Interior  According to official fact sheets, the Empire State Building weighs 365,000 short tons and has an internal volume of 37 million cubic feet . The interior required 1,172 miles of elevator cable and 2 million feet of electrical wires. It has a total floor area of 2,768,591 sq ft , and each of the floors in the base cover 2 acres . This gives the building capacity for 20,000 tenants and 15,000 visitors.The riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravitational stresses and wind loads. The amount of material used in the building's construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of 42 pounds per square foot versus the Willis Tower's 33 pounds per square foot and the John Hancock Center's 26 pounds per square foot . A December 1930 feature in Popular Mechanics estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of 50 short tons .Utilities are grouped in a central shaft. On the 6th through 86th stories, the central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides. Per the final specifications of the building, the corridor is surrounded in turn by office space 28 feet deep, maximizing office space at a time before air conditioning became commonplace. Each of the floors has 210 structural columns that pass through it, which provide structural stability but limits the amount of open space on these floors. The relative dearth of stone in the Empire State Building allows for more space overall, with a 1:200 stone to building ratio compared to a 1:50 ratio in similar buildings.  Lobby  The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and is the only place in the building where the design contains narrative motifs. It contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three crafts or industries used in the building's construction Electricity, Masonry, and Heating. The three story high space, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts to the north and south. These storefronts are flanked by tubes of dark rounded marble and topped by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble. The lobby contains two tiers of marble: a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from east to west.The western ends of the north and south walls include escalators to a mezzanine level. At the west end of the lobby, behind the security desk, is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built . The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect, contains an embossed outline of the building, with rays radiating from the spire and the sun behind it. In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a medallion in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is depicted in the bottom right and a plaque to the building's major developers is on the bottom left. A scale model of the building was also placed south of the security desk. The plaque at the western end of the lobby is on the eastern interior wall of a one story tall rectangular shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby. The rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle, as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side. At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low rise elevators in between the corridors. The western side of the rectangular elevator bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators , which go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from the northern and southern corridors, respectively. The side entrances from 33rd and 34th Street lead to two story high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass enclosed bridges at the mezzanine floor.Until the 1960s, an Art Deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the Machine Age, was installed in the lobby ceilings. Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur. The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Ren e Nemorov, in time for the 1964 World's Fair, depicting the building as the Eighth Wonder of the World alongside the traditional seven. The building's owners installed a series of paintings by the New York artist Kysa Johnson in the concourse level. Johnson later filed a federal lawsuit, in January 2014, under the Visual Artists Rights Act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist. As part of the building's 2010 renovation, Denise Amses commissioned a work consisting of 15,000 stars and 5,000 circles, superimposed on a 13 by 5 foot etched glass installation, in the lobby.  Elevators  The Empire State Building has 73 elevators in all, including service elevators. Its original 64 elevators, built by the Otis Elevator Company, in a central core and are of varying heights, with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the 80th floor. As originally built, there were four express elevators that connected the lobby, 80th floor, and several landings in between; the other 60 local elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. Of the 64 total elevators, 58 were for passenger use , and eight were for freight deliveries. The elevators were designed to move at 1,200 feet per minute . At the time of the skyscraper's construction, their practical speed was limited to 700 feet per minute per city law, but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened.Additional elevators connect the 80th floor to the six floors above it, as the six extra floors were built after the original 80 stories were approved. The elevators were mechanically operated until 2011, when they were replaced with automatic elevators during the 550 million renovation of the building. An additional elevator connects the 86th and 102nd floor observatories, which allows visitors access the 102nd floor observatory after having their tickets scanned. It also allows employees to access the mechanical floors located between the 87th and 101st floors.  Observation decks  The 80th, 86th, and 102nd floors contain observatories. The latter two observatories saw a combined average of four million visitors per year in 2010. Since opening, the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the Chrysler Building, the first One World Trade Center, or the Woolworth Building, despite being more expensive. There are variable charges to enter the observatories; one ticket allows visitors to go as high as the 86th floor, and there is an additional charge to visit the 102nd floor. Other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory, a premium guided tour with VIP access, and the AM PM package which allows for two visits in the same day. The 86th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open air outdoor viewing area, allowing for it to remain open 365 days a year regardless of the weather. The 102nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size. The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005 due to limited viewing capacity and long lines. The observation decks were redesigned in mid 1979. The 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019, allowing the windows to be extended from floor to ceiling and widening the space in the observatory overall. An observatory on the 80th floor, opened in 2019, includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by British artist Stephen Wiltshire.According to a 2010 report by Concierge.com, the five lines to enter the observation decks are as legendary as the building itself . Concierge.com stated that there were five lines: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck. However, in 2016, New York City's official tourism website, NYCgo.com, made note of only three lines: the security check line, the ticket purchase line, and the second elevator line. Following renovations completed in 2019, designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times, guests enter from a single entrance on 34th Street, where they make their way through 10,000 square foot exhibits on their way up to the observatories. Guests were offered a variety of ticket packages, including a package that enables them to skip the lines throughout the duration of their stay. The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.  New York Skyride  In early 1994, a motion simulator attraction was built on the 2nd floor, as a complement to the observation deck. The original cinematic presentation lasted approximately 25 minutes, while the simulation was about eight minutes. The ride had two incarnations. The original version, which ran from 1994 until around 2002, featured James Doohan, Star Trek's Scotty, as the airplane's pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the ride was closed. An updated version debuted in mid 2002, featuring actor Kevin Bacon as the pilot, with the new flight also going haywire. This new version served a more informative goal, as opposed to the old version's main purpose of entertainment, and contained details about the 9 11 attacks. The simulator received mixed reviews, with assessments of the ride ranging from great to satisfactory to corny .  Spire   Above the 102nd floor  The final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast, a 158 foot steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities, above the 86th floor. At the top would be a conical roof and the 102nd floor docking station. Inside, the elevators would ascend 167 feet from the 86th floor ticket offices to a 33 foot wide 101st floor waiting room. From there, stairs would lead to the 102nd floor, where passengers would enter the airships. The airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor.As constructed, the mast contains four rectangular tiers topped by a cylindrical shaft with a conical pinnacle. On the 102nd floor , there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor . This was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the building's spire, and has a circular balcony outside. It is now an access point to reach the spire for maintenance. The room now contains electrical equipment, but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there. Above the 103rd floor, there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work. The mast's 480 windows were all replaced in 2015. The mast serves as the base of the building's broadcasting antenna.  Broadcast stations  Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when NBC and RCA began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the mast, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there. In 1934, RCA was joined by Edwin Howard Armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna. This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first FM transmitter, continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong. Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 . NBC's FM station, W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940. NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the Federal Communications Commission ordered the exclusive deal be terminated. The FCC directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Other television broadcasters would later join RCA at the building on the 81st through 83rd floors, often along with sister FM stations. Construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on July 27, 1950, with TV, and FM, transmissions starting in 1951. The 200 foot broadcast tower was completed in 1953. From 1951, six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined 600,000 per year for the use of the antenna. In 1965, a separate set of FM antennae was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna.The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.The September 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a transmitter for ten days until the Armstrong Tower in Alpine, New Jersey was re activated temporarily. By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that Congress commissioned about the transition from analog television to digital television, it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered problematic due to interference from nearby buildings. In comparison, the congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference. In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby Cond Nast Building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building. Eleven television stations and twenty two FM stations had signed 15 year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in Bayonne, New Jersey, or Governors Island, would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a backup since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality. Following the construction of One World Trade Center in the late 2000s and early 2010s, some TV stations began moving their transmitting facilities there.As of 2021, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations: Television: WABC 7, WPIX 11, WXTV 41 Paterson, and WFUT 68 Newark FM: WINS 92.3, WPAT 93.1 Paterson, WNYC 93.9, WPLJ 95.5, WXNY 96.3, WQHT 97.1, WSKQ 97.9, WEPN 98.7, WHTZ 100.3 Newark, WCBS 101.1, WFAN 101.9, WNEW FM 102.7, WKTU 103.5 Lake Success, WAXQ 104.3, WWPR 105.1, WQXR 105.9 Newark, WLTW 106.7, and WBLS 107.5  History The site was previously owned by John Jacob Astor of the prominent Astor family, who had owned the site since the mid 1820s. In 1893, John Jacob Astor Sr.'s grandson William Waldorf Astor opened the Waldorf Hotel on the site. Four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site. The two portions of the Waldorf Astoria hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the largest hotel in the world at the time. After the death of its founding proprietor, George Boldt, in early 1918, the hotel lease was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont. By the 1920s, the old Waldorf Astoria was becoming dated and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north. Additionally, many stores had opened on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street. The Astor family decided to build a replacement hotel on Park Avenue and sold the hotel to Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in 1928 for 14 16 million. The hotel closed shortly thereafter on May 3, 1929.  Planning   Early plans  Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25 story office building on the Waldorf Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid 100,000 of the 1 million down payment required to start construction on the building, with the promise that the difference would be paid later. Brown borrowed 900,000 from a bank but defaulted on the loan.After Brown was unable to secure additional funding, the land was resold to Empire State Inc., a group of wealthy investors that included Louis G. Kaufman, Ellis P. Earle, John J. Raskob, Coleman du Pont, and Pierre S. du Pont. The name came from the state nickname for New York. Alfred E. Smith, a former Governor of New York and U.S. presidential candidate whose 1928 campaign had been managed by Raskob, was appointed head of the company. The group also purchased nearby land so they would have the 2 acres needed for the base, with the combined plot measuring 425 feet wide by 200 feet long. The Empire State Inc. consortium was announced to the public in August 1929. Concurrently, Smith announced the construction of an 80 story building on the site, to be taller than any other buildings in existence.Empire State Inc. contracted William F. Lamb, of architectural firm Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, to create the building design. Lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks using the firm's earlier designs for the Reynolds Building in Winston Salem, North Carolina as the basis. He had also been inspired by Raymond Hood's design for the Daily News Building, which was being constructed at the same time. Concurrently, Lamb's partner Richmond Shreve created bug diagrams of the project requirements. The 1916 Zoning Act forced Lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors. Consequently, the building was designed from the top down, giving it a pencil like shape. The plans were devised within a budget of 50 million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy within 18 months of the start of construction.  Design changes  The original plan of the building was 50 stories, but was later increased to 60 and then 80 stories. Height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned 80 story, 1,000 foot tall building would have unobstructed views of the city. The New York Times lauded the site's proximity to mass transit, with the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit's 34th Street station and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad's 33rd Street terminal one block away, as well as Penn Station two blocks away and Grand Central Terminal nine blocks away at its closest. It also praised the 3,000,000 square feet of proposed floor space near one of the busiest sections in the world . The Empire State Building was to be a typical office building, but Raskob intended to build it better and in a bigger way , according to architectural writer Donald J. Reynolds.While plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of world's tallest building was underway. 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building. The Race into the Sky , as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities. The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from 840 feet to 925 feet making it the world's tallest. The Chrysler Building added its 185 foot steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street. The Chrysler Building's developer, Walter Chrysler, realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having instructed his architect, William Van Alen, to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire. Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension. On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27 31 West 33rd Street, adding 75 feet to the width of the proposed office building's site. Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper. The plans included an observation deck on the 86th floor roof at a height of 1,050 feet , higher than the Chrysler's 71st floor observation deck.The 1,050 foot Empire State Building would only be 4 feet taller than the Chrysler Building, and Raskob was afraid that Chrysler might try to pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute. The plans were revised one last time in December 1929, to include a 16 story, 200 foot metal crown and an additional 222 foot mooring mast intended for dirigibles. The roof height was now 1,250 feet , making it the tallest building in the world by far, even without the antenna. The addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor, the now enclosed 86th floor, would have to be built below the crown; however, unlike the Chrysler's spire, the Empire State's mast would serve a practical purpose. A revised plan was announced to the public in late December 1929, just before the start of construction. The final plan was sketched within two hours, the night before the plan was supposed to be presented to the site's owners in January 1930. The New York Times reported that the spire was facing some technical problems , but they were no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan. By this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved. Lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final, approved plan: The program was short enough a fixed budget, no space more than 28 feet from window to corridor, as many stories of such space as possible, an exterior of limestone, and completion date of May 1 , 1931, which meant a year and six months from the beginning of sketches.  Construction  The contractors were Starrett Brothers and Eken, which were composed of Paul and William A. Starrett and Andrew J. Eken. The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont, while James Farley's General Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials. John W. Bowser was the construction superintendent of the project, and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom. The tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be finalized.  Hotel demolition  Demolition of the old Waldorf Astoria began on October 1, 1929. Stripping the building down was an arduous process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been. Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and 'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal. Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.By the time the hotel's demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building. The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange experienced the major and sudden Wall Street Crash, marking the beginning of the decade long Great Depression. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob, who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash. However, most of the investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a 27.5 million loan from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company so construction could begin. The stock market crash resulted in no demand for new office space; Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction, as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.  Steel structure  A structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930, with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on January 22, before the old hotel had been completely demolished. Two twelve hour shifts, consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the 55 foot foundation. Small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork. Excavation was nearly complete by early March, and construction on the building itself started on March 17, with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished. Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows, the large block Indiana Limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks, and the building's vertical lines. Four colossal columns, intended for installation in the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined 10,000,000 pounds when the building was finished.The structural steel was pre ordered and pre fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city's building code that would have allowed the Empire State Building's structural steel to carry 18,000 pounds per square inch , up from 16,000 pounds per square inch , thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000 psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence. The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930. From there, construction proceeded at a rapid pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors. This was made possible through precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels. On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.The scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying 16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, 450 cubic yards 340 m3 of sand and 300 bags of lime arriving at the construction site every day. There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch. Temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level. Additionally, carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks. The 57,480 short tons of steel ordered for the project was the largest ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined. According to historian John Tauranac, building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, and hardware from New England. The facade, too, used a variety of material, most prominently Indiana limestone but also Swedish black granite, terracotta, and brick.By June 20, the skyscraper's supporting steel structure had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the steel structure had been completed. Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction, a goal that they almost reached with their pace of 4 1 2 stories per week; prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been 3 1 2 stories per week. While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up . Some of the levels were still undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized. On September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands. The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day's New York Times, a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction. The steel structure was topped out at 1,048 feet on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of construction. Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.  Completion and scale  Work on the building's interior and crowning mast commenced after the topping out. The mooring mast topped out on November 21, two months after the steelwork had been completed. Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor. The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November. Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at 1,200 feet per minute , which represented the largest ever elevator order at the time.In addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building's first floor and basements. Concrete mixers, brick hoppers, and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public. At one point, over 200 trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day. A series of relay and erection derricks, placed on platforms erected near the building, lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations. The Empire State Building was structurally completed on April 11, 1931, twelve days ahead of schedule and 410 days after construction commenced. Al Smith shot the final rivet, which was made of solid gold. The project involved more than 3,500 workers at its peak, including 3,439 on a single day, August 14, 1930. Many of the workers were Irish and Italian immigrants, with a sizable minority of Mohawk ironworkers from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. According to official accounts, five workers died during the construction, although the New York Daily News gave reports of 14 deaths and a headline in the socialist magazine The New Masses spread unfounded rumors of up to 42 deaths. The Empire State Building cost 40,948,900 to build , including demolition of the Waldorf Astoria. This was lower than the 60 million budgeted for construction.Lewis Hine captured many photographs of the construction, documenting not only the work itself but also providing insight into the daily life of workers in that era. Hine's images were used extensively by the media to publish daily press releases. According to the writer Jim Rasenberger, Hine climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture, as no one ever had before , the dizzy work of building skyscrapers . In Rasenberger's words, Hine turned what might have been an assignment of corporate flak into exhilarating art . These images were later organized into their own collection. Onlookers were enraptured by the sheer height at which the steelworkers operated. New York magazine wrote of the steelworkers: Like little spiders they toiled, spinning a fabric of steel against the sky .  Opening and early years  The Empire State Building officially opened on May 1, 1931, forty five days ahead of its projected opening date, and eighteen months from the start of construction. The opening was marked with an event featuring United States President Herbert Hoover, who turned on the building's lights with the ceremonial button push from Washington, D.C. Over 350 guests attended the opening ceremony, and following luncheon, at the 86th floor including Jimmy Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Al Smith. An account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog, with other landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty being lost in the mist enveloping New York City. The Empire State Building officially opened the next day. Advertisements for the building's observatories were placed in local newspapers, while nearby hotels also capitalized on the events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to the newly opened building.According to The New York Times, builders and real estate speculators predicted that the 1,250 foot tall Empire State Building would be the world's tallest building for many years , thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry. At the time, most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than 1,200 feet , even with the hardy Manhattan bedrock as a foundation. Technically, it was believed possible to build a tower of up to 2,000 feet , but it was deemed uneconomical to do so, especially during the Great Depression. As the tallest building in the world, at that time, and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building became an icon of the city and, ultimately, of the nation.In 1932, the Fifth Avenue Association gave the building its 1931 gold medal for architectural excellence, signifying that the Empire State had been the best designed building on Fifth Avenue to open in 1931. A year later, on March 2, 1933, the movie King Kong was released. The movie, which depicted a large stop motion ape named Kong climbing the Empire State Building, made the still new building into a cinematic icon.  Tenants and tourism  At the beginning of 1931, Fifth Avenue was experiencing high demand for storefront space, with only 12 of 224 stores being unoccupied. The Empire State Building, along with 500 Fifth Avenue and 608 Fifth Avenue, were expected to add a combined 11 stores. The office space was less successful, as the Empire State Building's opening had coincided with the Great Depression in the United States. In the first year, only 23 percent of the available space was rented, as compared to the early 1920s, where the average building would be 52 percent occupied upon opening and 90 percent occupied within five years. The lack of renters led New Yorkers to deride the building as the Empty State Building or Smith's Folly .The earliest tenants in the Empire State Building were large companies, banks, and garment industries. Jack Brod, one of the building's longest resident tenants, co established the Empire Diamond Corporation with his father in the building in mid 1931 and rented space in the building until he died in 2008. Brod recalled that there were only about 20 tenants at the time of opening, including him, and that Al Smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh floor offices. Generally, during the early 1930s, it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in the building, despite Smith's and Raskob's aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew. The building's lights were continuously left on, even in the unrented spaces, to give the impression of occupancy. This was exacerbated by competition from Rockefeller Center as well as from buildings on 42nd Street, which, when combined with the Empire State Building, resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during the 1930s.Aggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce the Empire State Building's status as the world's tallest. The observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets. The building became a popular tourist attraction, with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in 1931. In its first year of operation, the observation deck made approximately 2 million in revenue, as much as its owners made in rent that year. By 1936, the observation deck was crowded on a daily basis, with food and drink available for purchase at the top, and by 1944 the building had received its five millionth visitor. In 1931, NBC took up tenancy, leasing space on the 85th floor for radio broadcasts. From the outset the building was in debt, losing 1 million per year by 1935. Real estate developer Seymour Durst recalled that the building was so underused in 1936 that there was no elevator service above the 45th floor, as the building above the 41st floor was empty except for the NBC offices and the Raskob Du Pont offices on the 81st floor.  Other events  Per the original plans, the Empire State Building's spire was intended to be an airship docking station. Raskob and Smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th floor, while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor. An elevator would ferry passengers from the 86th to the 101st floor after they had checked in on the 86th floor, after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board the airship. The idea, however, was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by the building itself, the wind currents across Manhattan, and the spires of nearby skyscrapers. Furthermore, even if the airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles, its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability, and then tie the craft's nose to the spire with no mooring lines securing the tail end of the craft. On September 15, 1931, a small commercial United States Navy airship circled 25 times in 45 mile per hour winds. The airship then attempted to dock at the mast, but its ballast spilled and the craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies. The near disaster scuttled plans to turn the building's spire into an airship terminal, although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward.On July 28, 1945, a B 25 Mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 79th and 80th floors. One engine completely penetrated the building and landed in a neighboring block, while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft. Fourteen people were killed in the incident, but the building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later.  Profitability  By the 1940s, the Empire State Building was 98 percent occupied. The structure broke even for the first time in the 1950s. At the time, mass transit options in the building's vicinity were limited compared to the present day. Despite this challenge, the Empire State Building began to attract renters due to its reputation. A 222 foot radio antenna was erected on top of the towers starting in 1950, allowing the area's television stations to be broadcast from the building.Despite the turnaround in the building's fortunes, Raskob listed it for sale in 1951, with a minimum asking price of 50 million. The property was purchased by business partners Roger L. Stevens, Henry Crown, Alfred R. Glancy and Ben Tobin. The sale was brokered by the Charles F. Noyes Company, a prominent real estate firm in upper Manhattan, for 51 million, the highest price paid for a single structure at the time. By this time, the Empire State had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in the building, according to the Cortland Standard. That same year, six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of 600,000 to use the building's antenna, which was completed in 1953. Crown bought out his partners' ownership stakes in 1954, becoming the sole owner. The following year, the American Society of Civil Engineers named the building one of the Seven Modern Civil Engineering Wonders .In 1961, Lawrence A. Wien signed a contract to purchase the Empire State Building for 65 million, with Harry B. Helmsley acting as partners in the building's operating lease. This became the new highest price for a single structure. Over 3,000 people paid 10,000 for one share each in a company called Empire State Building Associates. The company in turn subleased the building to another company headed by Helmsley and Wien, raising 33 million of the funds needed to pay the purchase price. In a separate transaction, the land underneath the building was sold to Prudential Insurance for 29 million. Helmsley, Wien, and Peter Malkin quickly started a program of minor improvement projects, including the first ever full building facade refurbishment and window washing in 1962, the installation of new flood lights on the 72nd floor in 1964, and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in 1966. The little used western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until 1964, at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area.  Loss of tallest building title  In 1961, the same year that Helmsley, Wien, and Malkin had purchased the Empire State Building, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey formally backed plans for a new World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The plan originally included 66 story twin towers with column free open spaces. The Empire State's owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers' 7.6 million square feet of office space would create a glut of rentable space in Manhattan as well as take away the Empire State Building's profits from lessees. A revision in the World Trade Center's plan brought the twin towers to 1,370 feet each or 110 stories, taller than the Empire State. Opponents of the new project included prominent real estate developer Robert Tishman, as well as Wien's Committee for a Reasonable World Trade Center. In response to Wien's opposition, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin said that Wien was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his Empire State Building as the world's tallest building.The World Trade Center's twin towers started construction in 1966. The following year, the Ostankino Tower succeeded the Empire State Building as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. In 1970, the Empire State surrendered its position as the world's tallest building, when the World Trade Center's still under construction North Tower surpassed it, on October 19; the North Tower was topped out on December 23, 1970.In December 1975, the observation deck was opened on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers, significantly higher than the 86th floor observatory on the Empire State Building. The latter was also losing revenue during this period, particularly as a number of broadcast stations had moved to the World Trade Center in 1971; although the Port Authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the Empire State until 1984. The Empire State Building was still seen as prestigious, having seen its forty millionth visitor in March 1971.  1980s and 1990s  By 1980, there were nearly two million annual visitors, although a building official had previously estimated between 1.5 million and 1.75 million annual visitors. The building received its own ZIP code in May 1980 in a roll out of 63 new postal codes in Manhattan. At the time, its tenants collectively received 35,000 pieces of mail daily. The Empire State Building celebrated its 50th anniversary on May 1, 1981, with a much publicized, but poorly received, laser light show, as well as an Empire State Building Week that ran through to May 8.The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on May 19, 1981, citing the historic nature of the first and second floors, as well as the fixtures and interior components of the upper floors. The New York City Planning Commission endorsed the landmark status. The building became a National Historic Landmark in 1986 in close alignment to the New York City Landmarks report. The Empire State Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places the following year due to its architectural significance.Capital improvements were made to the Empire State Building during the early to mid 1990s at a cost of 55 million. These improvements entailed replacing alarm systems, elevators, windows, and air conditioning; making the observation deck compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ; and refurbishing the limestone facade. The observatory renovation was added after disability rights groups and the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the building in 1992, in what was the first lawsuit filed by an organization under the new law. A settlement was reached in 1994, in which the Empire State Building Associates agreed to add ADA compliant elements, such as new elevators, ramps, and automatic doors, during its ongoing renovation.Prudential sold the land under the building in 1991 for 42 million to a buyer representing hotelier Hideki Yokoi, who was imprisoned at the time in connection with the deadly Hotel New Japan Fire at the Hotel New Japan in Tokyo. In 1994, Donald Trump entered into a joint venture agreement with Yokoi, with a shared goal of breaking the Empire State Building's lease on the land in an effort to gain total ownership of the building so that, if successful, the two could reap the potential profits of merging the ownership of the building with the land beneath it. Having secured a half ownership of the land, Trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it, even though Helmsley and Malkin had already started their refurbishment project. He sued Empire State Building Associates in February 1995, claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a high rise slum and a second rate, rodent infested office tower. Trump had intended to have Empire State Building Associates evicted for violating the terms of their lease, but was denied. This led to Helmsley's companies countersuing Trump in May. This sparked a series of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years, partly arising from Trump's desire to obtain the building's master lease by taking it from Empire State Building Associates. Upon Harry Helmsley's death in 1997, the Malkins sued Helmsley's widow, Leona Helmsley, for control of the building.  21st century   2000s  Following the destruction of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, but was only the second tallest building in the Americas after the Sears Tower in Chicago. As a result of the attacks, transmissions from nearly all of the city's commercial television and FM radio stations were again broadcast from the Empire State Building. The attacks also led to an increase in security due to persistent terror threats against prominent sites in New York City.In 2002, Trump and Yokoi sold their land claim to the Empire State Building Associates, now headed by Malkin, in a 57.5 million sale. This action merged the building's title and lease for the first time in half a century. Despite the lingering threat posed by the 9 11 attacks, the Empire State Building remained popular with 3.5 million visitors to the observatories in 2004, compared to about 2.8 million in 2003.Even though she maintained her ownership stake in the building until the post consolidation IPO in October 2013, Leona Helmsley handed over day to day operations of the building in 2006 to Peter Malkin's company. In 2008, the building was temporarily stolen by the New York Daily News to show how easy it was to transfer the deed on a property, since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information, as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money. The paperwork submitted to the city included the names of Fay Wray, the famous star of King Kong, and Willie Sutton, a notorious New York bank robber. The newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners, who at that time were Empire State Land Associates.  2010s to present  Starting in 2009, the building's public areas received a 550 million renovation, with improvements to the air conditioning and waterproofing, renovations to the observation deck and main lobby, and relocation of the gift shop to the 80th floor. About 120 million was spent on improving the energy efficiency of the building, with the goal of reducing energy emissions by 38 within five years. For example, all of the windows were refurbished onsite into film coated superwindows which block heat but pass light. Air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced, saving 17 million of the project's capital cost immediately and partially funding some of the other retrofits. The Empire State Building won the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold for Existing Buildings rating in September 2011, as well as the World Federation of Great Towers' Excellence in Environment Award for 2010. For the LEED Gold certification, the building's energy reduction was considered, as was a large purchase of carbon offsets. Other factors included low flow bathroom fixtures, green cleaning supplies, and use of recycled paper products.On April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center topped out, taking the Empire State Building's record of tallest in the city. By 2014, the building was owned by the Empire State Realty Trust , with Anthony Malkin as chairman, CEO, and president. The ESRT was a public company, having begun trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange the previous year. In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority was issued new fully diluted shares equivalent to 9.9 of the trust; this investment gave them partial ownership of the entirety of the ESRT's portfolio, and as a result, partial ownership of the Empire State Building. The trust's president John Kessler called it an endorsement of the company's irreplaceable assets . The investment has been described by the real estate magazine The Real Deal as an unusual move for a sovereign wealth fund , as these funds typically buy direct stakes in buildings rather than real estate companies. Other foreign entities that have a stake in the ESRT include investors from Norway, Japan, and Australia.A renovation of the Empire State Building was commenced in the 2010s to further improve energy efficiency, public areas, and amenities. In August 2018, to improve the flow of visitor traffic, the main visitor's entrance was shifted to 20 West 34th Street as part of a major renovation of the observatory lobby. The new lobby includes several technological features, including large LED panels, digital ticket kiosks in nine languages, and a two story architectural model of the building surrounded by two metal staircases. The first phase of the renovation, completed in 2019, features an updated exterior lighting system and digital hosts. The new lobby also features free Wi Fi provided for those waiting. A 10,000 square foot exhibit with nine galleries opened in July 2019. The 102nd floor observatory, the third phase of the redesign, reopened to the public on October 12, 2019. That portion of the project included outfitting the space with floor to ceiling glass windows and a brand new glass elevator. The final portion of the renovations to be completed was a new observatory on the 80th floor, which opened on December 2, 2019. In total, the renovation had cost 165 million and taken four years to finish.A comprehensive restoration of the building's mooring and antenna masts also began in June 2019. Antennas on the mooring mast were removed or relocated to the upper mast, while the aluminum panels were cleaned and coated with silver paint. To minimize disruption to the observation decks, the restoration work took place at night. The project was completed by late 2020.  Height records  The longest world record held by the Empire State Building was for the tallest skyscraper , which it held for 42 years until it was surpassed by the North Tower of the World Trade Center in October 1970. The Empire State Building was also the tallest human made structure in the world before it was surpassed by the Griffin Television Tower Oklahoma in 1954, and the tallest freestanding structure in the world until the completion of the Ostankino Tower in 1967. An early 1970s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional 11 floors, which would have brought the building's height to 1,494 feet and made it once again the world's tallest at the time, was considered but ultimately rejected.With the destruction of the World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, the Empire State Building again became the tallest building in New York City, and the second tallest building in the Americas, surpassed only by the Willis Tower in Chicago. The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in New York until the new One World Trade Center reached a greater height in April 2012. As of 2022, it is the seventh tallest building in New York City and the tenth tallest in the United States. The Empire State Building is the 49th tallest in the world as of February 2021. It is also the eleventh tallest freestanding structure in the Americas behind the tallest U.S. buildings and the CN Tower.  Notable tenants As of 2013, the building houses around 1,000 businesses. Current tenants include: Former tenants include: The National Catholic Welfare Council The King's College China National Tourist Office National Film Board of Canada Nathaniel Branden Institute Schenley Industries YWCA of the USA  Incidents   1945 plane crash  At 9:40 am on July 28, 1945, a B 25 Mitchell bomber, piloted in thick fog by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr., crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building between the 79th and 80th floors . One engine completely penetrated the building, landing on the roof of a nearby building where it started a fire that destroyed a penthouse. The other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft causing a fire, which was extinguished in 40 minutes. Fourteen people were killed in the incident. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator, which still stands as the Guinness World Record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded.Despite the damage and loss of life, the building was open for business on many floors two days later. The crash helped spur the passage of the long pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the incident. Also as a result of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Administration enacted strict regulations regarding flying over New York City, setting a minimum flying altitude of 2,500 feet above sea level regardless of the weather conditions.A year later, on July 24, 1946, another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building. The unidentified twin engine plane scraped past the observation deck, scaring the tourists there.  2000 elevator plunge  On January 24, 2000, an elevator in the building suddenly descended 40 stories after a cable that controlled the cabin's maximum speed was severed. The elevator fell from the 44th floor to the fourth floor, where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system. Despite the 40 floor fall, both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured. After the fall, building inspectors reviewed all of the building's elevators.  Suicide attempts  Because of the building's iconic status, it and other Midtown landmarks are popular locations for suicide attempts. More than 30 people have attempted suicide over the years by jumping from the upper parts of the building, with most attempts being successful.The first suicide from the building occurred on April 7, 1931, before it was even completed, when a carpenter who had been laid off went to the 58th floor and jumped. The first suicide after the building's opening occurred from the 86th floor observatory in February 1935, when Irma P. Eberhardt fell 1,029 feet onto a marquee sign. On December 16, 1943, William Lloyd Rambo jumped to his death from the 86th floor, landing amidst Christmas shoppers on the street below. In the early morning of September 27, 1946, shell shocked Marine Douglas W. Brashear Jr. jumped from the 76th floor window of the Grant Advertising Agency; police found his shoes 50 feet from his body.On May 1, 1947, Evelyn McHale leapt to her death from the 86th floor observation deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse a few minutes after her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: He is much better off without me.... I wouldn't make a good wife for anybody . The photo ran in the May 12, 1947 edition of Life magazine and is often referred to as The Most Beautiful Suicide . It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled Suicide . A 7 foot mesh fence was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three week span in October and November of that year. By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.Only one person has jumped from the upper observatory. Frederick Eckert of Astoria ran past a guard in the enclosed 102nd floor gallery on November 3, 1932, and jumped a gate leading to an outdoor catwalk intended for dirigible passengers. He landed and died on the roof of the 86th floor observation promenade.Two people have survived falls by not falling more than a floor. On December 2, 1979, Elvita Adams jumped from the 86th floor, only to be blown back onto a ledge on the 85th floor by a gust of wind and left with a broken hip. On April 25, 2013, a man fell from the 86th floor observation deck, but he landed alive with minor injuries on an 85th floor ledge where security guards brought him inside and paramedics transferred him to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.  Shootings  Two fatal shootings have occurred in the direct vicinity of the Empire State Building. Abu Kamal, a 69 year old Palestinian teacher, shot seven people on the 86th floor observation deck during the afternoon of February 23, 1997. He killed one person and wounded six others before committing suicide. Kamal reportedly committed the shooting in response to events happening in Palestine and Israel.On the morning of August 24, 2012, 58 year old Jeffrey T. Johnson shot and killed a former co worker on the building's Fifth Avenue sidewalk. He had been laid off from his job in 2011. Two police officers confronted the gunman, and he aimed his firearm at them. They responded by firing 16 shots, killing him but also wounding nine bystanders. Most of the injured were hit by bullet fragments, although three took direct hits from bullets.  Impact  As the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation. In 2013, Time magazine noted that the Empire State Building seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with . The historian John Tauranac called it 'the' twentieth century New York building , despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings.Early architectural critics also focused on the Empire State Building's exterior ornamentation. Architectural critic Talbot Hamlin wrote in 1931, That it is the world's tallest building is purely incidental. George Shepard Chappell, writing in The New Yorker under the pseudonym T Square , wrote the same year that the Empire State Building had a palpably enormous appeal to the general public, and that its difference and distinction lay in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design . However, architectural critics also wrote negatively of the mast, especially in light of its failure to become a real air terminal. Chappell called the mast a silly gesture and Lewis Mumford called it a public comfort station for migratory birds . Nevertheless, architecture critic Douglas Haskell said the Empire State Building's appeal came from the fact that it was caught at the exact moment of transition caught between metal and stone, between the idea of 'monumental mass' and that of airy volume, between handicraft and machine design, and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication.  As icon  Early in the building's history, travel companies such as Short Line Motor Coach Service and New York Central Railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city. After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect Paul Goldberger noted that the Empire State Building is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good. As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was America's favorite building . The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants. The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men who were themselves new Americans. The architectural critic Jonathan Glancey refers to the building as an icon of American design . In addition, the New York New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the Empire Tower , a 47 story replica of the Empire State Building.In addition, the New York New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the Chrysler Tower , a replica of the Chrysler Building measuring 35 or 40 stories tall. A portion of the hotel's interior was also designed to resemble the Empire State Building's interior.The Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a wonder of the world due to the massive effort expended during construction. The Washington Star listed it as part of one of the seven wonders of the modern world in 1931, while Holiday magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the Eiffel Tower and the Great Pyramid of Giza. The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States in 1958, and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World in 1994. Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the seven wonders of engineering . It has often been called the Eighth Wonder of the World as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening. The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building also became the standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures globally, both natural and human made.  In media  As an icon of New York City, the Empire State Building has been featured in various films, books, TV shows, and video games. According to the building's official website, more than 250 movies contain depictions of the Empire State Building. In his book about the building, John Tauranac writes that its first documented appearance in popular culture was Swiss Family Manhattan, a 1932 children's story by Christopher Morley. A year later, the film King Kong depicted Kong, a large stop motion ape that climbs the Empire State Building, bringing the building into the popular imagination. Later movies such as An Affair to Remember , Sleepless in Seattle , and Independence Day also prominently featured the building. The building has also been featured in other works, such as Daleks in Manhattan , a 2007 episode of the TV series Doctor Who; and Empire, an eight hour black and white silent film by Andy Warhol, which was later added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.  Empire State Building Run Up  The Empire State Building Run Up, a foot race from ground level to the 86th floor observation deck, has been held annually since 1978. It is organized by NYCRUNS. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often tower running enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of 1,050 ft and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9 minutes and 33 seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist Paul Crake in 2003, at a climbing rate of 6,593 ft per hour.

It prevented system overloads by monitoring call center traffic and prioritizing tasks on phone switching systems to enable more robust service during peak calling times. At Bell Laboratories where she worked for over 32 years, Hoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology.  Early life Erna Schneider was born on June 19, 1926, in Irvington, New Jersey. Her family lived in South Orange, New Jersey and her father was a dentist and her mother was a teacher. She had a younger brother who died from polio at the age of five. She loved swimming, sailing, canoeing, and was interested in science at an early age. According to one source, she read the biography of Marie Curie which suggested to her that she could succeed in a scientific field despite the prevailing ideas about gender roles at the time. She graduated from Columbia High School in nearby Maplewood in 1944, which would later induct her into its hall of fame in 2007.Hoover attended Wellesley College where she studied classical and medieval philosophy and history. She graduated from Wellesley in 1948 with honors, earning a bachelor's degree, and she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa and was honored as a Durant Scholar. She earned her PhD from Yale University in philosophy and foundations of mathematics in 1951.  Career Hoover was a professor at Swarthmore College from 1951 to 1954 where she taught philosophy and logic. However, she had been unable to win a tenure track position, possibly because of her gender and marital status, according to one view. In 1953, she married Charles Wilson Hoover, Jr., and he was very supportive of his wife's career pursuits. In 1954, she joined Bell Labs as a senior technical associate, and was promoted in 1956. According to one source, the internal training program was the equivalent of a master's degree in computer science. Switching systems were moving from electronic to computer based technologies. Problems happened when a call center would be inundated with thousands of calls in a short amount of time, overwhelming the unreliable electronic relays, and causing the entire system to freeze up. Hoover used her knowledge of symbolic logic and feedback theory to program the control mechanisms of a call center to use data about incoming calls to impose order on the whole system. It used computer electronic methods to monitor the frequency of incoming calls at different times. Her method gave priority to processes that were concerned with the input and output of the switch over processes that were less important such as record keeping and billing. The computer, as a result, would adjust the call center's acceptance rate automatically, greatly reducing the overloading problem. The system became known as stored program control.Hoover's thinking about the invention happened while she was in a hospital recuperating after having given birth to her second daughter, according to several sources. Lawyers for Bell Labs handling the patent had to go to her house to visit her while she was on maternity leave so that she could sign the papers. The result of the invention was much more robust service to callers during peak load times: To my mind it was kind of common sense ... I designed the executive program for handling situations when there are too many calls, to keep it operating efficiently without hanging up on itself. Basically it was designed to keep the machine from throwing up its hands and going berserk. For her invention, termed Feedback Control Monitor for Stored Program Data Processing System, Hoover was awarded patent 3,623,007 in November 1971, one of the first software patents ever issued. The patent was applied for in 1967 and issued in 1971. As a result of her invention, she became the first woman supervisor of a technical department at Bell Labs. She headed the operations support department in 1987. The principles of her invention are still being used in telecommunications equipment in the 21st century. Hoover worked on various high level applications such as research radar control programs of the Safeguard Anti Ballistic Missile System, which were systems to intercept incoming intercontinental ballistic missile warheads. Her department worked on artificial intelligence methods, large databases, and transactional software to support large telephone networks. She worked at Bell Labs for 32 years until retiring in 1987. In addition, she served on the boards of higher education organizations in New Jersey. As a member of the board of Trustees of The College of New Jersey, she was described as a visionary who was instrumental in increasing women faculty as well as enrolling the best prepared high school graduates in the state, and she helped build the college into a respected institution of higher education by lobbying extensively for state funding.  Awards She was awarded one of the first patents for computer software. She was elected as a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008.

The organization promotes excellence in the profession and in education through an emphasis on scholarship, character, and attitude. Joining HKN is by invitation only. Membership is a lifelong designation for individuals who have distinguished themselves as students or as professionals in electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, and other fields of IEEE interest.  About HKN IEEE HKN Eta Kappa Nu was founded in 1904 as an independent honor society for electrical engineering. It has expanded its scope through the years and it became an organizational unit within IEEE in 2010. Over 260 collegiate chapters have been chartered world wide and more than 200,000 members have been elected to membership. These chapters recognize high scholarship through membership and foster a culture of service and volunteerism within their host departments. They are noted for student led engagement with peers, faculty, and industry through tutoring, maker space management, networking events, etc. Most members are inducted as students, but distinguished professionals may be inducted as well. The guiding ideals for membership eligibility of scholarship, character, and attitude have remained unchanged since the early years. The corporate IEEE HKN supports the chapters and the profession with a variety of signature activities. An annual Founders Day promotion during October encourages chapters to celebrate HKN and to engage in service in their local community in recognition of HKN's founding. An annual student conference addresses networking, leadership, and professional development objectives. A prominent awards program includes six award categories to promote educational and career excellence. An online magazine, The Bridge, is the archival publication for students, alumni members, and others in the profession and industry. Collegiate chapter activities, including the member election process, are organized around the recognition of academic accomplishment, the promotion of ethical behavior and volunteer service, and the development of leadership and collaborative skills. The member induction ceremony states, This is what we strive for as members of Eta Kappa Nu: to lead a balanced life, a life in which scholarship, character, and attitude are jointly developed. Student members join their collegiate chapter of IEEE HKN for reasons including: Formal recognition of academic accomplishment Interaction with faculty and successful students Opportunities for leadership experience Organized service projects and service learning Opportunities for professional development Lifelong professional community within IEEEStudent membership is valued as an early indicator of career success; many prominent leaders, inventors, and entrepreneurs are HKN.  History of HKN IEEE HKN  Eta Kappa Nu was founded on October 28, 1904 as the national honor society for electrical engineering students at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Maurice L. Carr and nine other undergraduates formed the first chapter and developed a national structure. Their vision for the honor association combined collegiate engagement with a professional community to aid student and alumni members and to support the general profession. Character and attitude were designated along with scholarship as the three ideals to be recognized and promoted through membership and activity. Hence, HKN is concerned with more than simply scholarship and the collegiate experience.The first century of Eta Kappa Nu began with two of the founders, Maurice L. Carr and Edmund B. Wheeler, serving as the first and second national presidents, respectively. The next chapters were organized at Purdue University, Ohio State University, and Illinois Institute of Technology. By the centennial in 2004, more than 200 student chapters as well as several alumni chapters had been chartered. These chapters have sustained records of local service and engagement activities. The national organization developed prominent awards for outstanding chapters, students, teachers, young professionals, and service in electrical engineering. The scope expanded to both electrical and computer engineering in 2000. Also, HKN created a membership path for professionals and an Eminent Member recognition for career accomplishments. The early history is documented in History of Eta Kappa Nu by Larry Dwon. The second century of Eta Kappa Nu has a continued emphasis on the original vision, but the program and structure have been modified. Its signature activities have been revised to include special attention on service and student conferences. It has formalized a relationship within IEEE as an organizational unit in which HKN is now IEEE HKN and it is governed by a Board of Governors that are elected by the chapters. This merger became effective 1 September 2010. As a result of the merger, chapters are being chartered internationally and membership eligibility is expanded to all IEEE fields of interest. The first chapters outside the U.S. were chartered in 2012 at the University of Hong Kong and at Dalhousie University . The headquarters was moved to IEEE in Piscataway, NJ where the office is administered by the IEEE HKN Director and staff. IEEE HKN has close ties with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association . An important repository of HKN IEEE HKN history is the IEEE History Center, especially its Engineering and Technology History Wiki .  Symbols of IEEE HKN Eta Kappa Nu's name is based on the Greek word for amber elektron from which the English words electron , electricity , and electronic are derived.  In Greek, the word is   or   . The first, fourth, and last letters form the society name of Eta Kappa Nu, which abbreviates to HKN. The emblem is a stylized representation of a Wheatstone bridge. This circuit is used to determine an unknown resistance from three known resistances. A membership analogy is made in which career success is determined when a balance of scholarship, character, and attitude is achieved. These three ideals are the basis for member eligibility. The shield of HKN dates from 1927 and symbolizes several aspects of HKN history. The three ideals are represented prominently by the three cubes of magnetite in the diagonal band and are also represented in the emblem atop the shield.  The caduceus in the honor point of the shield is a memorial to founder Maurice L. Carr who favored this symbol. The hand of Jupiter stands for the first chapter Alpha and the ten lightning bolts refer to the original ten founding members. The shield incorporates the colors for HKN navy blue to represent loyalty and scarlet to represent zeal. Student members will often wear honor cords in these colors at their graduation. Members are also encouraged to wear pins of either the emblem or the shield. A ceremony is the last step in members' entry into HKN. An induction ritual reviews the history, the three ideals, and the symbols as described here. In addition, the induction officials will speak as avatars, or in the voice, of selected historical individuals. This HKN review and the use of avatars reflect an intention to honor and to remember the contributions of the past.  Recognitions and Awards IEEE Eta Kappa Nu membership is an honor society recognition and is earned through qualification, election, and induction. Any student chapter may conduct the membership process for undergraduates, graduate students, and professional members. Minimum scholastic or professional qualifications are defined. However, a chapter may set higher scholastic or career qualifications and will evaluate the character and attitude qualifications locally. An alumni chapter or the Board of Governors may conduct a membership process for professional members. During the induction ceremony, new members commit themselves to the ideals of HKN. An Eminent Member category was approved as the highest membership grade in 1941 and the first recognitions were in 1950. This grade is reserved for those individuals, who by their technical attainments and contributions to society, have shown themselves to be outstanding leaders in an IEEE designed field of interest, and great benefactors to society. Individuals must be recognized during their lifetimes for the Eminent Member category; deceased individuals may be recognized as Honorary Eminent Members. Only 144 Eminent Members and 10 Honorary Eminent Members have been so recognized by the HKN. Select Eminent Members are identified with an asterisk in the list at the end of this article. IEEE HKN has an annual awards program to honor accomplishment related to the Eta Kappa Nu vision. The initial award category was created in 1932 for outstanding chapter activities. Several awards are named for important HKN volunteers. There are six award categories: Outstanding Chapter Award Alton B. Zerby and Carl T. Koerner Outstanding Student Award C. Holmes MacDonald Outstanding Teaching Award Outstanding Young Professional Award Distinguished Service Award Asad M. Madni Outstanding Technical Achievement and Excellence Award.  The Bridge magazine  The Bridge magazine is an open access publication of IEEE and is the archival, flagship publication of IEEE Eta Kappa Nu. Features relate to technical, historical, and professional interests of the membership and other content deals with activities of the organization. Chapters, student members, and alumni are welcome to submit potential content. Alton B. Zerby, Executive Secretary 1934 1958, wrote that the magazine started as a vehicle of communication between students and alumni. It continues to connect students and alumni, as well as to promote the activities and recognition programs of IEEE HKN and to highlight the development of technology and the profession. The magazine is managed by volunteers, an Editor in Chief and an Editorial Board , with assistance from the IEEE HKN Director and other staff. The history of the magazine dates back to the first publication of Eta Kappa Nu which was a short booklet entitled The Electric Field. This name continued until 1908. The name of The Eta Kappa Nu Yearbook was used briefly. The first use of The Bridge as the publication name occurred in 1910. The volume label was added later and the volume count dates to the publication year of 1905. The number of issues per year has varied from one to four. Originally a print publication, the magazine became electronic only after the HKN merger with IEEE in 2010. Recent issues have won numerous international awards for excellence.  Chapters IEEE Eta Kappa Nu collegiate chapters are present at education institutions of higher learning across the world. These chapters are designated by a Greek letter or letters starting with the first chapter Alpha at the University of Illinois. The second chapter, Beta at Purdue University, was organized and began inducted members in 1906; however, the chapter was not officially approved by the Purdue University administration until 1913. The chapter with the Eta designation is administered by the IEEE HKN Board of Governors for at large inductions. The following table gives the chapter name, host institution, charter date, and location. Several alumni chapters exist that are geographically based.

            "text": "Evangelista Torricelli ; 15 October 1608 25 October 1647 was an Italian physicist and mathematician, and a student of Galileo. He is best known for his invention of the barometer, but is also known for his advances in optics and work on the method of indivisibles. The Torr is also named after him.  Biography   Early life  Torricelli was born on 15 October 1608 in Rome, the firstborn child of Gaspare Torricelli and Caterina Angetti. His family was from Faenza in the Province of Ravenna, then part of the Papal States. His father was a textile worker and the family was very poor. Seeing his talents, his parents sent him to be educated in Faenza, under the care of his uncle, Giacomo , a Camaldolese monk, who first ensured that his nephew was given a sound basic education. He then entered young Torricelli into a Jesuit College in 1624, possibly the one in Faenza itself, to study mathematics and philosophy until 1626, by which time his father, Gaspare, had died. The uncle then sent Torricelli to Rome to study science under the Benedictine monk Benedetto Castelli, professor of mathematics at the Collegio della Sapienza . Castelli was a student of Galileo Galilei. Benedetto Castelli made experiments on running water , and he was entrusted by Pope Urban VIII with hydraulic undertakings. There is no actual evidence that Torricelli was enrolled at the university. It is almost certain that Torricelli was taught by Castelli. In exchange he worked for him as his secretary from 1626 to 1632 in a private arrangement. Because of this, Torricelli was exposed to experiments funded by Pope Urban VIII. While living in Rome, Torricelli became also the student of the mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri, with whom he became great friends. It was in Rome that Torricelli also became friends with two other students of Castelli, Raffaello Magiotti and Antonio Nardi. Galileo referred to Torricelli, Magiotti, and Nardi affectionately as his triumvirate in Rome.  Career  In 1632, shortly after the publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Torricelli wrote to Galileo of reading it with the delight ... of one who, having already practiced all of geometry most diligently ... and having studied Ptolemy and seen almost everything of Tycho Brahe, Kepler and Longomontanus, finally, forced by the many congruences, came to adhere to Copernicus, and was a Galileian in profession and sect . Aside from several letters, little is known of Torricelli's activities in the years between 1632 and 1641, when Castelli sent Torricelli's monograph of the path of projectiles to Galileo, then a prisoner in his villa at Arcetri. Although Galileo promptly invited Torricelli to visit, Torricelli did not accept until just three months before Galileo's death. The reason for this was that Torricelli's mother, Caterina Angetti died. his short intercourse with the great mathematician enabled Torricelli to finish the fifth dialogue under the personal direction of its author; it was published by Viviani, another pupil of Galileo, in 1674. After Galileo's death on 8 January 1642, Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici asked Torricelli to succeed Galileo as the grand ducal mathematician and chair of mathematics at the University of Pisa. Right before the appointment, Torricelli was considering returning to Rome because of there being nothing left for him in Florence, where he had invented the barometer. In this new role he solved some of the great mathematical problems of the day, such as finding a cycloid's area and center of gravity. As a result of this study, he wrote the book the Opera Geometrica in which he described his observations. The book was published in 1644.Little was known about Torricelli in regard to his works in geometry when he accepted the honorable position, but after he published Opera Geometrica two years later, he became highly esteemed in that discipline. He was interested in Optics, and invented a method whereby microscopic lenses might be made of glass which could be easily melted in a lamp. As a result, he designed and built a number of telescopes and simple microscopes; several large lenses, engraved with his name, are still preserved in Florence. On 11 June 1644, he famously wrote in a letter to Michelangelo Ricci: Noi viviamo sommersi nel fondo d'un pelago d'aria. However his work on the cycloid involved him in a controversy with Gilles de Roberval, who accused him of plagiarizing his earlier solution of the problem of its quadrature. Although it appears that Torricelli reached his solution independently, the matter was still in dispute up to his death.  Death  Torricelli died of fever, most likely typhoid, in Florence on 25 October 1647, 10 days after his 39th birthday, and was buried at the Basilica of San Lorenzo. He left all his belongings to his adopted son Alessandro. Belonging to that first period are his pamphlets on Solidi spherali, Contatti and the major part of the propositions and sundry problems which were gathered together by Viviani after Torricelli's death. This early work owes much to the study of the classics. Sixty eight years after Torricelli had died, his genius still filled his contemporaries with admiration, as evidenced by the anagram below the frontispice of Lezioni accademiche d'Evangelista Torricelli published in 1715: En virescit Galileus alter, meaning Here blossoms another Galileo.  Honours  In Faenza, a statue of Torricelli was created in 1868 in gratitude for all that Torricelli had done in advancing science during his short lifetime.The asteroid 7437 Torricelli and a crater on the Moon were named in his honour. In 1830, botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle published Torricellia, which is a genus of flowering plants from Asia belonging to the family Torricelliaceae. They were named in Evangelista Torricelli's honour.  Torricelli's work in physics The perusal of Galileo's Two New Sciences inspired Torricelli with many developments of the mechanical principles there set forth, which he embodied in a treatise De motu . Its communication by Castelli to Galileo in 1641, with a proposal that Torricelli should reside with him, led to Torricelli traveling to Florence, where he met Galileo, and acted as his amanuensis during the three remaining months of his life.  Suction pumps and the invention of the barometer  Torricelli's work led to first speculations about atmospheric pressure, and to the corollary invention of the mercury barometer  the principle of which was described as early as 1631 by Ren Descartes, although there is no evidence that Descartes ever built such an instrument.The barometer arose from the need to solve a theoretical and practical problem: a suction pump could only raise water up to a height of 10 metres . In the early 1600s, Torricelli's teacher, Galileo, argued that suction pumps were able to draw water from a well because of the force of vacuum. This argument, however, failed to explain the fact that suction pumps could only raise water to a height of 10 metres. After Galileo's death, Torricelli proposed, rather, that we live in a sea of air that exerts a pressure analogous in many ways to the pressure of water on submerged objects. According to this hypothesis, at sea level, the air in the atmosphere has weight that roughly equals the weight of a 34 feet column of water. When a suction pump creates a vacuum inside a tube, the atmosphere no longer pushes on the water column below the piston but still pushes down on the surface of the water outside, thus causing the water to rise until its weight counterbalances the weight of the atmosphere. This hypothesis might have led him to a striking prediction: That a suction pump might only raise mercury, which is 13 times heavier than water, to 1 13 the height of the water column in a similar pump. . In 1643, Torricelli filled a meter long tube with mercury thirteen times denser than water and setting it vertically into a basin of the liquid metal. The column of mercury fell to about 76 centimetres , producing a Torricellian vacuum above. This was also the first recorded incident of creating permanent vacuum. A second unambiguous prediction of Torricelli's sea of air hypothesis was made by Blaise Pascal, who argued, and proved, that the mercury column of the barometer should drop at higher elevations. Indeed, it dropped slightly on top of a 50 meter bell tower, and much more so at the peak of a 1460 meter mountain. As we know now, the column's height fluctuates with atmospheric pressure at the same location, a fact which plays a key role in weather forecasting. Baseline changes in the column's height at different elevations, in turn, underlie the principle of the altimeter. Thus, this work laid the foundations for the modern concept of atmospheric pressure, the first barometer, an instrument that would later play a key role in weather forecasting, and the first pressure altimeter, which measures altitude and is often used in hiking, climbing, skiing, and aviation. The solution to the suction pump puzzle and the discovery of the principle of the barometer and altimeter have perpetuated Torricelli's fame with terms such as Torricellian tube and Torricellian vacuum . The torr, a unit of pressure used in vacuum measurements, is named after him.  Torricelli's law  Torricelli also discovered a law, regarding the speed of a fluid flowing out of an opening, which was later shown to be a particular case of Bernoulli's principle. He found that water leaks out a small hole in the bottom of a container at a rate proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. So if the container is an upright cylinder with a small leak at the bottom and y is the depth of the water at time t, then                d    y           d    t                k         u       y          displaystyle frac dy dt k sqrt u y  for some constant k 0.  Torricelli's principle  The concept of center of gravity was discovered by Archimedes. Torricelli, following in his footsteps, discovered an important new principle, Torricelli s principle, which says: if any number of bodies be so connected that, by their motion, their centre of gravity can neither ascend nor descend, then those bodies are in equilibrium. This is essentially a version of the principle of virtual work. This principle was later used by Christian Huygens to study pendulum motion.  The study of projectiles  Torricelli studied projectiles and how they traveled through the air. Perhaps his most notable achievement in the field of projectiles was to establish for the first time the idea of an envelope: projectiles sent out at ... the same speed in all directions trace out parabolas which are all tangent to a common paraboloid. This envelope became known as the parabola di sicurezza .  Cause of wind  Torricelli gave the first scientific description of the cause of wind: ... winds are produced by differences of air temperature, and hence density, between two regions of the earth.  Torricelli's work in mathematics Torricelli is also famous for the discovery of the Torricelli's trumpet whose surface area is infinite, but whose volume is finite. This was seen as an incredible paradox by many at the time, including Torricelli himself, and prompted a fierce controversy about the nature of infinity, also involving the philosopher Hobbes. It is supposed by some to have led to the idea of a completed infinity . Torricelli tried several alternative proofs, attempting to prove that its surface area was also finite all of which failed.Torricelli was also a pioneer in the area of infinite series. In his De dimensione parabolae of 1644, Torricelli considered a decreasing sequence of positive terms         a      0        ,     a      1        ,     a      2        ,        displaystyle a 0 ,a 1 ,a 2 , ldots  and showed the corresponding telescoping series                      displaystyle  cdots  necessarily converges to         a      0          L     displaystyle a 0 L , where L is the limit of the sequence, and in this way gives a proof of the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Torricelli developed further the method of indivisibles of Cavalieri. Many 17th century mathematicians learned of the method through Torricelli whose writing was more accessible than Cavalieri's.  Italian submarines  Several Italian Navy submarines were named after Evangelista Torricelli: A Micca class submarine, built in 1918, stricken in 1930 An Archimede class submarine , transferred to Spain in 1937 and renamed General Mola, stricken in 1959 A Benedetto Brin class submarine , sank in the Red Sea due to the British Navy in 1940 Evangelista Torricelli, the former USS Lizardfish, transferred to Italy in 1960 and decommissioned in 1976  Selected works His original manuscripts are preserved at Florence, Italy.

Since the 2019 redefinition of SI base units, which took effect on 20 May 2019, the Faraday constant has the exactly defined value given by the product of the elementary charge e and Avogadro constant NA:       F     e        N          A             1.602176634        10          19             C       6.02214076        10      23             m   o      l           1             9.64853321233100184        10      4             C            m   o      l           1           .     displaystyle F equiv e times N mathrm A 1.602176634 times 10 19 mathrm C times 6.02214076 times 10 23 mathrm mol 1 9.64853321233100184 times 10 4 mathrm C cdot mol 1 . The Faraday constant can be thought of as the conversion factor between the mole and the coulomb , and is therefore of particular use in electrochemistry. Because 1 mole contains exactly NA 6.02214076 1023 entities, and 1 coulomb contains exactly             1    e                    10        19           1.602176634          displaystyle frac 1 e  frac 10 19 1.602176634  elementary charges, the Faraday constant is given by the quotient of these two quantities:       F               N             A                   1                e             9.64853321233100184        10      4             C            m   o      l           1           .     displaystyle F frac N mathrm A  1 e 9.64853321233100184 times 10 4 mathrm C cdot mol 1 . One common use of the Faraday constant is in electrolysis calculations. One can divide the amount of charge by the Faraday constant in order to find the chemical amount of a substance that has been electrolyzed. The value of F was first determined by weighing the amount of silver deposited in an electrochemical reaction in which a measured current was passed for a measured time, and using Faraday's law of electrolysis.  Other common units 96.485 kJ per volt gram equivalent 23.061 kcal per volt gram equivalent 26.801 A h mol  Faraday a unit of charge Related to the Faraday constant is the faraday , a unit of electrical charge. It is much less common than the coulomb, but is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons, i.e., 1 faraday F 1 mol 9.648533212... 104 C.Conversely, the Faraday constant F equals 1 faraday per mole. The faraday is not to be confused with the farad, an unrelated unit of capacitance .  Popular media The Simpsons episode Dark Knight Court has Mr. Burns asking Comic Book Guy how much he wants for his entire comic book inventory. He says the speed of light expressed as dollars and Mr. Burns tells Smithers to just give him Faraday's Constant . The check is written for 96,485.34.

            "text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Justice, the FBI is also a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counter terrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes.Although many of the FBI's functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the British MI5, the New Zealand GCSB and the Russian FSB. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency , which has no law enforcement authority and is focused on intelligence collection abroad, the FBI is primarily a domestic agency, maintaining 56 field offices in major cities throughout the United States, and more than 400 resident agencies in smaller cities and areas across the nation. At an FBI field office, a senior level FBI officer concurrently serves as the representative of the Director of National Intelligence.Despite its domestic focus, the FBI also maintains a significant international footprint, operating 60 Legal Attache offices and 15 sub offices in U.S. embassies and consulates across the globe. These foreign offices exist primarily for the purpose of coordination with foreign security services and do not usually conduct unilateral operations in the host countries. The FBI can and does at times carry out secret activities overseas, just as the CIA has a limited domestic function; these activities generally require coordination across government agencies. The FBI was established in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation, the BOI or BI for short. Its name was changed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935. The FBI headquarters is the J. Edgar Hoover Building, located in Washington, D.C.  Mission, priorities and budget   Mission  The mission of the FBI is:Protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States  Priorities  Currently, the FBI's top priorities are: Protect the United States from terrorist attacks Protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations, espionage, and cyber operations Combat significant cyber criminal activity Combat public corruption at all levels Protect civil rights Combat transnational criminal enterprises Combat major white collar crime Combat significant violent crime  Budget  In the fiscal year 2019, the Bureau's total budget was approximately 9.6 billion.In the Authorization and Budget Request to Congress for fiscal year 2021, the FBI asked for 9,800,724,000. Of that money, 9,748,829,000 would be used for Salaries and Expenses and 51,895,000 for Construction. The S E program saw an increase of 199,673,000.  History   Background  In 1896, the National Bureau of Criminal Identification was founded, which provided agencies across the country with information to identify known criminals. The 1901 assassination of President William McKinley created a perception that the United States was under threat from anarchists. The Departments of Justice and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted more power to monitor them.The Justice Department had been tasked with the regulation of interstate commerce since 1887, though it lacked the staff to do so. It had made little effort to relieve its staff shortage until the Oregon land fraud scandal at the turn of the 20th century. President Roosevelt instructed Attorney General Charles Bonaparte to organize an autonomous investigative service that would report only to the Attorney General.Bonaparte reached out to other agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service, for personnel, investigators in particular. On May 27, 1908, Congress forbade this use of Treasury employees by the Justice Department, citing fears that the new agency would serve as a secret police department. Again at Roosevelt's urging, Bonaparte moved to organize a formal Bureau of Investigation, which would then have its own staff of special agents.  Creation of BOI  The Bureau of Investigation was created on July 26, 1908. Attorney General Bonaparte, using Department of Justice expense funds, hired thirty four people, including some veterans of the Secret Service, to work for a new investigative agency. Its first chief was Stanley Finch. Bonaparte notified the Congress of these actions in December 1908.The bureau's first official task was visiting and making surveys of the houses of prostitution in preparation for enforcing the White Slave Traffic Act or Mann Act, passed on June 25, 1910. In 1932, the bureau was renamed the United States Bureau of Investigation.  Creation of FBI  The following year, 1933, the BOI was linked to the Bureau of Prohibition and rechristened the Division of Investigation ; it became an independent service within the Department of Justice in 1935. In the same year, its name was officially changed from the Division of Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation .  J. Edgar Hoover as FBI director  J. Edgar Hoover served as FBI director from 1924 to 1972, a combined 48 years with the BOI, DOI, and FBI. He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the FBI Laboratory, which officially opened in 1932, as part of his work to professionalize investigations by the government. Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. But as detailed below, his proved to be a highly controversial tenure as Bureau director, especially in its later years. After Hoover's death, Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI directors to ten years. Early homicide investigations of the new agency included the Osage Indian murders. During the War on Crime of the 1930s, FBI agents apprehended or killed a number of notorious criminals who committed kidnappings, bank robberies, and murders throughout the nation, including John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Kate Ma Barker, Alvin Creepy Karpis, and George Machine Gun Kelly. Other activities of its early decades focused on the scope and influence of the white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan, a group with which the FBI was evidenced to be working in the Viola Liuzzo lynching case. Earlier, through the work of Edwin Atherton, the BOI claimed to have successfully apprehended an entire army of Mexican neo revolutionaries under the leadership of General Enrique Estrada in the mid 1920s, east of San Diego, California. Hoover began using wiretapping in the 1920s during Prohibition to arrest bootleggers. In the 1927 case Olmstead v. United States, in which a bootlegger was caught through telephone tapping, the United States Supreme Court ruled that FBI wiretaps did not violate the Fourth Amendment as unlawful search and seizure, as long as the FBI did not break into a person's home to complete the tapping. After Prohibition's repeal, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934, which outlawed non consensual phone tapping, but did allow bugging. In the 1939 case Nardone v. United States, the court ruled that due to the 1934 law, evidence the FBI obtained by phone tapping was inadmissible in court. After Katz v. United States overturned Olmstead, Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Control Act, allowing public authorities to tap telephones during investigations, as long as they obtained warrants beforehand.  National security  Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, the bureau investigated cases of espionage against the United States and its allies. Eight Nazi agents who had planned sabotage operations against American targets were arrested, and six were executed under their sentences. Also during this time, a joint US UK code breaking effort called The Venona Project with which the FBI was heavily involved broke Soviet diplomatic and intelligence communications codes, allowing the US and British governments to read Soviet communications. This effort confirmed the existence of Americans working in the United States for Soviet intelligence. Hoover was administering this project, but he failed to notify the Central Intelligence Agency of it until 1952. Another notable case was the arrest of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in 1957. The discovery of Soviet spies operating in the US motivated Hoover to pursue his longstanding concern with the threat he perceived from the American Left.  Japanese American internment  In 1939, the Bureau began compiling a custodial detention list with the names of those who would be taken into custody in the event of war with Axis nations. The majority of the names on the list belonged to Issei community leaders, as the FBI investigation built on an existing Naval Intelligence index that had focused on Japanese Americans in Hawaii and the West Coast, but many German and Italian nationals also found their way onto the FBI Index list. Robert Shivers, head of the Honolulu office, obtained permission from Hoover to start detaining those on the list on December 7, 1941, while bombs were still falling over Pearl Harbor. Mass arrests and searches of homes began a few hours after the attack, and over the next several weeks more than 5,500 Issei men were taken into FBI custody. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. FBI Director Hoover opposed the subsequent mass removal and confinement of Japanese Americans authorized under Executive Order 9066, but Roosevelt prevailed. The vast majority went along with the subsequent exclusion orders, but in a handful of cases where Japanese Americans refused to obey the new military regulations, FBI agents handled their arrests. The Bureau continued surveillance on Japanese Americans throughout the war, conducting background checks on applicants for resettlement outside camp, and entering the camps and grooming informants to monitor dissidents and troublemakers . After the war, the FBI was assigned to protect returning Japanese Americans from attacks by hostile white communities.  Sex deviates program  According to Douglas M. Charles, the FBI's sex deviates program began on April 10, 1950, when J. Edgar Hoover forwarded to the White House, to the U.S. Civil Service Commission, and to branches of the armed services a list of 393 alleged federal employees who had allegedly been arrested in Washington, D.C., since 1947, on charges of sexual irregularities . On June 20, 1951, Hoover expanded the program by issuing a memo establishing a uniform policy for the handling of the increasing number of reports and allegations concerning present and past employees of the United States Government who assertedly sic are sex deviates. The program was expanded to include non government jobs. According to Athan Theoharis, In 1951 he Hoover had unilaterally instituted a Sex Deviates program to purge alleged homosexuals from any position in the federal government, from the lowliest clerk to the more powerful position of White house aide. On May 27, 1953, Executive Order 10450 went into effect. The program was expanded further by this executive order by making all federal employment of homosexuals illegal. On July 8, 1953, the FBI forwarded to the U.S. Civil Service Commission information from the sex deviates program. In 1977 1978, 300,000 pages, collected between 1930 and the mid 1970s, in the sex deviates program were destroyed by FBI officials.  Civil rights movement  During the 1950s and 1960s, FBI officials became increasingly concerned about the influence of civil rights leaders, whom they believed either had communist ties or were unduly influenced by communists or fellow travelers . In 1956, for example, Hoover sent an open letter denouncing Dr. T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader, surgeon, and wealthy entrepreneur in Mississippi who had criticized FBI inaction in solving recent murders of George W. Lee, Emmett Till, and other blacks in the South. The FBI carried out controversial domestic surveillance in an operation it called the COINTELPRO, from COunter INTELligence PROgram . It was to investigate and disrupt the activities of dissident political organizations within the United States, including both militant and non violent organizations. Among its targets was the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a leading civil rights organization whose clergy leadership included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who is addressed in more detail below. The FBI frequently investigated King. In the mid 1960s, King began to criticize the Bureau for giving insufficient attention to the use of terrorism by white supremacists. Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most notorious liar in the United States. In his 1991 memoir, Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide. Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 1964 suicide package sent by the Bureau that combined a letter to the civil rights leader telling him You are done. There is only one way out for you. with audio recordings of King's sexual indiscretions.In March 1971, the residential office of an FBI agent in Media, Pennsylvania was burgled by a group calling itself the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI. Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers, including The Harvard Crimson. The files detailed the FBI's extensive COINTELPRO program, which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry S. Reuss of Wisconsin. The country was jolted by the revelations, which included assassinations of political activists, and the actions were denounced by members of the Congress, including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs. The phones of some members of the Congress, including Boggs, had allegedly been tapped.  Kennedy's assassination  When President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed, the jurisdiction fell to the local police departments until President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the FBI to take over the investigation. To ensure clarity about the responsibility for investigation of homicides of federal officials, the Congress passed a law that included investigations of such deaths of federal officials, especially by homicide, within FBI jurisdiction. This new law was passed in 1965.  Organized crime  In response to organized crime, on August 25, 1953, the FBI created the Top Hoodlum Program. The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers. After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti. The RICO Act is still used today for all organized crime and any individuals who may fall under the Act's provisions. In 2003, a congressional committee called the FBI's organized crime informant program one of the greatest failures in the history of federal law enforcement. The FBI allowed four innocent men to be convicted of the March 1965 gangland murder of Edward Teddy Deegan in order to protect Vincent Flemmi, an FBI informant. Three of the men were sentenced to death , and the fourth defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Two of the four men died in prison after serving almost 30 years, and two others were released after serving 32 and 36 years. In July 2007, U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner in Boston found that the Bureau had helped convict the four men using false witness accounts given by mobster Joseph Barboza. The U.S. Government was ordered to pay 100 million in damages to the four defendants.  Special FBI teams  In 1982, the FBI formed an elite unit to help with problems that might arise at the 1984 Summer Olympics to be held in Los Angeles, particularly terrorism and major crime. This was a result of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, when terrorists murdered the Israeli athletes. Named the Hostage Rescue Team, or HRT, it acts as a dedicated FBI SWAT team dealing primarily with counter terrorism scenarios. Unlike the special agents serving on local FBI SWAT teams, HRT does not conduct investigations. Instead, HRT focuses solely on additional tactical proficiency and capabilities. Also formed in 1984 was the Computer Analysis and Response Team, or CART.From the end of the 1980s to the early 1990s, the FBI reassigned more than 300 agents from foreign counter intelligence duties to violent crime, and made violent crime the sixth national priority. With cuts to other well established departments, and because terrorism was no longer considered a threat after the end of the Cold War, the FBI assisted local and state police forces in tracking fugitives who had crossed state lines, which is a federal offense. The FBI Laboratory helped develop DNA testing, continuing its pioneering role in identification that began with its fingerprinting system in 1924.  Notable efforts in the 1990s  On May 1, 1992, FBI SWAT and HRT personnel in Los Angeles County, California aided local officials in securing peace within the area during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. HRT operators, for instance, spent 10 days conducting vehicle mounted patrols throughout Los Angeles, before returning to Virginia.Between 1993 and 1996, the FBI increased its counter terrorism role following the first 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and the arrest of the Unabomber in 1996. Technological innovation and the skills of FBI Laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted. However, Justice Department investigations into the FBI's roles in the Ruby Ridge and Waco incidents were found to have been obstructed by agents within the Bureau. During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the FBI was criticized for its investigation of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. It has settled a dispute with Richard Jewell, who was a private security guard at the venue, along with some media organizations, in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation; this had briefly led to his being wrongly suspected of the bombing. After Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act , and the Economic Espionage Act , the FBI followed suit and underwent a technological upgrade in 1998, just as it did with its CART team in 1991. Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center and the National Infrastructure Protection Center were created to deal with the increase in Internet related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened U.S. operations. With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.  September 11 attacks  During the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, FBI agent Leonard W. Hatton Jr. was killed during the rescue effort while helping the rescue personnel evacuate the occupants of the South Tower, and he stayed when it collapsed. Within months after the attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller, who had been sworn in a week before the attacks, called for a re engineering of FBI structure and operations. He made countering every federal crime a top priority, including the prevention of terrorism, countering foreign intelligence operations, addressing cybersecurity threats, other high tech crimes, protecting civil rights, combating public corruption, organized crime, white collar crime, and major acts of violent crime.In February 2001, Robert Hanssen was caught selling information to the Russian government. It was later learned that Hanssen, who had reached a high position within the FBI, had been selling intelligence since as early as 1979. He pleaded guilty to espionage and received a life sentence in 2002, but the incident led many to question the security practices employed by the FBI. There was also a claim that Hanssen might have contributed information that led to the September 11, 2001, attacks.The 9 11 Commission's final report on July 22, 2004, stated that the FBI and Central Intelligence Agency were both partially to blame for not pursuing intelligence reports that could have prevented the September 11 attacks. In its most damning assessment, the report concluded that the country had not been well served by either agency and listed numerous recommendations for changes within the FBI. While the FBI did accede to most of the recommendations, including oversight by the new Director of National Intelligence, some former members of the 9 11 Commission publicly criticized the FBI in October 2005, claiming it was resisting any meaningful changes.On July 8, 2007, The Washington Post published excerpts from UCLA Professor Amy Zegart's book Spying Blind: The CIA, the FBI, and the Origins of 9 11. The Post reported, from Zegart's book, that government documents showed that both the CIA and the FBI had missed 23 potential chances to disrupt the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The primary reasons for the failures included: agency cultures resistant to change and new ideas; inappropriate incentives for promotion; and a lack of cooperation between the FBI, CIA, and the rest of the United States Intelligence Community. The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter terrorism or counter intelligence agency, due in large part to deeply ingrained agency cultural resistance to change. For example, FBI personnel practices continued to treat all staff other than special agents as support staff, classifying intelligence analysts alongside the FBI's auto mechanics and janitors.  Faulty bullet analysis  For over 40 years, the FBI crime lab in Quantico had believed that lead alloys used in bullets had unique chemical signatures. It was analyzing the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically, not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory, but also to a single box of bullets. The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18 month independent review of comparative bullet lead analysis. In 2003, its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony. It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed, and the conclusion, that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition, was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence. One year later, the FBI decided to stop conducting bullet lead analyses.After a 60 Minutes The Washington Post investigation in November 2007, two years later, the Bureau agreed to identify, review, and release all pertinent cases, and notify prosecutors about cases in which faulty testimony was given.  Technology  In 2012, the FBI formed the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center to develop technology for assisting law enforcement with technical knowledge regarding communication services, technologies, and electronic surveillance.  Organization   Organizational structure  The FBI is organized into functional branches and the Office of the Director, which contains most administrative offices. An executive assistant director manages each branch. Each branch is then divided into offices and divisions, each headed by an assistant director. The various divisions are further divided into sub branches, led by deputy assistant directors. Within these sub branches, there are various sections headed by section chiefs. Section chiefs are ranked analogous to special agents in charge. Four of the branches report to the deputy director while two report to the associate director. The main branches of the FBI are: FBI Intelligence Branch Executive Assistant Director: Stephen Laycock FBI National Security Branch Executive Assistant Director: John Brown FBI Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch Executive Assistant Director: Terry Wade FBI Science and Technology Branch Executive Assistant Director: Darrin E. Jones FBI Information and Technology Branch Executive Assistant Director: Michael Gavin FBI Human Resources Branch Executive Assistant Director: Jeffrey S. SalletEach branch focuses on different tasks, and some focus on more than one. Here are some of the tasks that different branches are in charge of:  FBI Headquarters Washington D.C.  National Security Branch Counterintelligence Division Counterterrorism Division Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate High Value Detainee Interrogation Group Terrorist Screening Center Intelligence Branch Directorate of Intelligence Office of Partner Engagement Office of Private SectorFBI Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch Criminal Investigation Division Cyber Division Critical Incident Response Group International Operation Division Victim Services DivisionScience and Technology Branch Operational Technology Division Laboratory Division Criminal Justice Information Services Division  Other Headquarter Offices  Information and Technology Branch IT Enterprise Services Division IT Applications and Data Division IT Infrastructure Division IT Management Division IT Engineering Division IT Services DivisionHuman Resources Branch Training Division Human Resources Division Security Division Administrative and financial management support Facilities and Logistics Services Division Finance Division Records Management Division Resource Planning Office Inspection Division   Office of the Director  The Office of the Director serves as the central administrative organ of the FBI. The office provides staff support functions to the five function branches and the various field divisions. The office is managed by the FBI associate director, who also oversees the operations of both the Information and Technology and Human Resources Branches. Senior staff Deputy director Associate deputy director Chief of staffOffice of the Director Finance and Facilities Division Information Management Division Insider Threat Office Inspection Division Office of the Chief Information Officer Office of Congressional Affairs Office of Diversity and Inclusion Office of Equal Employment Opportunity Affairs Office of the General Counsel Office of Integrity and Compliance Office of Internal Auditing Office of the Ombudsman Office of Professional Responsibility Office of Public Affairs Resource Planning Office  Rank structure  The following is a listing of the rank structure found within the FBI : Field agents New agent trainee Special agent Senior special agent Supervisory special agent Assistant special agent in charge Special agent in charge FBI management Deputy assistant director Assistant director Associate executive assistant director Executive assistant director Associate deputy director Deputy chief of staff Chief of staff and special counsel to the director Deputy director Director  Legal authority  The FBI's mandate is established in Title 28 of the United States Code , Section 533, which authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States. Other federal statutes give the FBI the authority and responsibility to investigate specific crimes. The FBI's chief tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The FBI is also charged with the responsibility of enforcing compliance of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 and investigating violations of the act in addition to prosecuting such violations with the United States Department of Justice . The FBI also shares concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement Administration in the enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. The USA PATRIOT Act increased the powers allotted to the FBI, especially in wiretapping and monitoring of Internet activity. One of the most controversial provisions of the act is the so called sneak and peek provision, granting the FBI powers to search a house while the residents are away, and not requiring them to notify the residents for several weeks afterward. Under the PATRIOT Act's provisions, the FBI also resumed inquiring into the library records of those who are suspected of terrorism . In the early 1980s, Senate hearings were held to examine FBI undercover operations in the wake of the Abscam controversy, which had allegations of entrapment of elected officials. As a result, in the following years a number of guidelines were issued to constrain FBI activities. A March 2007 report by the inspector general of the Justice Department described the FBI's widespread and serious misuse of national security letters, a form of administrative subpoena used to demand records and data pertaining to individuals. The report said that between 2003 and 2005, the FBI had issued more than 140,000 national security letters, many involving people with no obvious connections to terrorism.Information obtained through an FBI investigation is presented to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or Department of Justice official, who decides if prosecution or other action is warranted. The FBI often works in conjunction with other federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in seaport and airport security, and the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating airplane crashes and other critical incidents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations has nearly the same amount of investigative manpower as the FBI and investigates the largest range of crimes. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, then Attorney General Ashcroft assigned the FBI as the designated lead organization in terrorism investigations after the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. HSI and the FBI are both integral members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force.  Indian reservations  The federal government has the primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious crime on Indian reservations. The FBI does not specifically list crimes in Native American land as one of its priorities. Often serious crimes have been either poorly investigated or prosecution has been declined. Tribal courts can impose sentences of up to three years, under certain restrictions.  Infrastructure  The FBI is headquartered at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., with 56 field offices in major cities across the United States. The FBI also maintains over 400 resident agencies across the United States, as well as over 50 legal attach s at United States embassies and consulates. Many specialized FBI functions are located at facilities in Quantico, Virginia, as well as a data campus in Clarksburg, West Virginia, where 96 million sets of fingerprints from across the United States are stored, along with others collected by American authorities from prisoners in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan. The FBI is in process of moving its Records Management Division, which processes Freedom of Information Act requests, to Winchester, Virginia.According to The Washington Post, the FBI is building a vast repository controlled by people who work in a top secret vault on the fourth floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington. This one stores the profiles of tens of thousands of Americans and legal residents who are not accused of any crime. What they have done is appear to be acting suspiciously to a town sheriff, a traffic cop or even a neighbor. The FBI Laboratory, established with the formation of the BOI, did not appear in the J. Edgar Hoover Building until its completion in 1974. The lab serves as the primary lab for most DNA, biological, and physical work. Public tours of FBI headquarters ran through the FBI laboratory workspace before the move to the J. Edgar Hoover Building. The services the lab conducts include Chemistry, Combined DNA Index System , Computer Analysis and Response, DNA Analysis, Evidence Response, Explosives, Firearms and Tool marks, Forensic Audio, Forensic Video, Image Analysis, Forensic Science Research, Forensic Science Training, Hazardous Materials Response, Investigative and Prospective Graphics, Latent Prints, Materials Analysis, Questioned Documents, Racketeering Records, Special Photographic Analysis, Structural Design, and Trace Evidence. The services of the FBI Laboratory are used by many state, local, and international agencies free of charge. The lab also maintains a second lab at the FBI Academy. The FBI Academy, located in Quantico, Virginia, is home to the communications and computer laboratory the FBI utilizes. It is also where new agents are sent for training to become FBI special agents. Going through the 21 week course is required for every special agent. First opened for use in 1972, the facility is located on 385 acres of woodland. The Academy trains state and local law enforcement agencies, which are invited to the law enforcement training center. The FBI units that reside at Quantico are the Field and Police Training Unit, Firearms Training Unit, Forensic Science Research and Training Center, Technology Services Unit , Investigative Training Unit, Law Enforcement Communication Unit, Leadership and Management Science Units , Physical Training Unit, New Agents' Training Unit , Practical Applications Unit , the Investigative Computer Training Unit and the College of Analytical Studies . In 2000, the FBI began the Trilogy project to upgrade its outdated information technology infrastructure. This project, originally scheduled to take three years and cost around 380 million, ended up over budget and behind schedule. Efforts to deploy modern computers and networking equipment were generally successful, but attempts to develop new investigation software, outsourced to Science Applications International Corporation , were not. Virtual Case File, or VCF, as the software was known, was plagued by poorly defined goals, and repeated changes in management. In January 2005, more than two years after the software was originally planned for completion, the FBI officially abandoned the project. At least 100 million was spent on the project, which never became operational. The FBI has been forced to continue using its decade old Automated Case Support system, which IT experts consider woefully inadequate. In March 2005, the FBI announced it was beginning a new, more ambitious software project, code named Sentinel, which they expected to complete by 2009. Carnivore was an electronic eavesdropping software system implemented by the FBI during the Clinton administration; it was designed to monitor email and electronic communications. After prolonged negative coverage in the press, the FBI changed the name of its system from Carnivore to DCS1000 . DCS is reported to stand for Digital Collection System ; the system has the same functions as before. The Associated Press reported in mid January 2005 that the FBI essentially abandoned the use of Carnivore in 2001, in favor of commercially available software, such as NarusInsight. The Criminal Justice Information Services Division is located in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Organized beginning in 1991, the office opened in 1995 as the youngest agency division. The complex is the length of three football fields. It provides a main repository for information in various data systems. Under the roof of the CJIS are the programs for the National Crime Information Center , Uniform Crime Reporting , Fingerprint Identification, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System , NCIC 2000, and the National Incident Based Reporting System . Many state and local agencies use these data systems as a source for their own investigations and contribute to the database using secure communications. FBI provides these tools of sophisticated identification and information services to local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies. The FBI heads the National Virtual Translation Center, which provides timely and accurate translations of foreign intelligence for all elements of the Intelligence Community. In June 2021, the FBI held a groundbreaking for its planned FBI Innovation Center, set to be built in Huntsville, Alabama. The Innovation Center is to be part of a large, college like campus costing a total of 1.3 billion in Redstone Arsenal and will act as a center for cyber threat intelligence, data analytics, and emerging threat training.  Personnel  As of 31 December 2009, the FBI had a total of 33,852 employees. That includes 13,412 special agents and 20,420 support professionals, such as intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists, information technology specialists, and other professionals.The Officer Down Memorial Page provides the biographies of 86 FBI agents who have died in the line of duty from 1925 to February 2021.  Hiring process  To apply to become an FBI agent, one must be between the ages of 23 and 37, unless one is a preference eligible veteran, in which case one may apply after age 37. The applicant must also hold U.S. citizenship, be of high moral character, have a clean record, and hold at least a four year bachelor's degree. At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required. All FBI employees require a Top Secret security clearance, and in many instances, employees need a TS SCI clearance. To obtain a security clearance, all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations , which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. Special agent candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test , which includes a 300 meter run, one minute sit ups, maximum push ups, and a 1.5 mile run. Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use. Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI. Up until 1975, the FBI had a minimum height requirement of 5 feet 7 inches .  BOI and FBI directors  FBI directors are appointed by the President of the United States and must be confirmed by the United States Senate to serve a term of office of ten years, subject to resignation or removal by the President at his her discretion before their term ends. Additional terms are allowed following the same procedure. J. Edgar Hoover, appointed by President Calvin Coolidge in 1924, was by far the longest serving director, serving until his death in 1972. In 1968, Congress passed legislation, as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, requiring Senate confirmation of appointments of future directors. As the incumbent, this legislation did not apply to Hoover. The last FBI director was Andrew McCabe. The current FBI director is Christopher A. Wray appointed by President Donald Trump. The FBI director is responsible for the day to day operations at the FBI. Along with the deputy director, the director makes sure cases and operations are handled correctly. The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership in any one of the FBI field offices is staffed with qualified agents. Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI. Since then, the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence , who in turn reports to the President.  Firearms  Upon qualification, an FBI special agent is issued a full size Glock 22 or compact Glock 23 semi automatic pistol, both of which are chambered in the .40 S W cartridge. In May 1997, the FBI officially adopted the Glock, in .40 S W, for general agent use, and first issued it to New Agent Class 98 1 in October 1997. At present, the Glock 23 FG R is the issue sidearm. New agents are issued firearms, on which they must qualify, on successful completion of their training at the FBI Academy. The Glock 26 , Glock 23 and Glock 27 are authorized as secondary weapons. Special agents are also authorized to purchase and qualify with the Glock 21 in .45 ACP.Special agents of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and regional SWAT teams are issued the Springfield Armory Professional Model 1911 pistol in .45 ACP.In June 2016, the FBI awarded Glock a contract for new handguns. Unlike the currently issued .40 S W chambered Glock pistols, the new Glocks will be chambered for 9 mm Parabellum. The contract is for the full size Glock 17M and the compact Glock 19M. The M means the Glocks have been modified to meet government standards specified by a 2015 government request for proposal.  Publications  The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the FBI Law Enforcement Communication Unit, with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel. First published in 1932 as Fugitives Wanted by Police, the FBI Law Bulletin covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues, such as crime mapping and use of force, as well as recent criminal justice research, and ViCAP alerts, on wanted suspects and key cases. The FBI also publishes some reports for both law enforcement personnel as well as regular citizens covering topics including law enforcement, terrorism, cybercrime, white collar crime, violent crime, and statistics. However, the vast majority of federal government publications covering these topics are published by the Office of Justice Programs agencies of the United States Department of Justice, and disseminated through the National Criminal Justice Reference Service.  Crime statistics  During the 1920s the FBI began issuing crime reports by gathering numbers from local police departments. Due to limitations of this system that were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s victims often simply did not report crimes to the police in the first place the Department of Justice developed an alternative method of tallying crime, the victimization survey.  Uniform Crime Reports  The Uniform Crime Reports compile data from over 17,000 law enforcement agencies across the country. They provide detailed data regarding the volume of crimes to include arrest, clearance , and law enforcement officer information. The UCR focuses its data collection on violent crimes, hate crimes, and property crimes. Created in the 1920s, the UCR system has not proven to be as uniform as its name implies. The UCR data only reflect the most serious offense in the case of connected crimes and has a very restrictive definition of rape. Since about 93 of the data submitted to the FBI is in this format, the UCR stands out as the publication of choice as most states require law enforcement agencies to submit this data. Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2006 was released on June 4, 2006. The report shows violent crime offenses rose 1.3 , but the number of property crime offenses decreased 2.9 compared to 2005.  National Incident Based Reporting System  The National Incident Based Reporting System crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary based UCR system. As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20 of the United States population and 16 of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.  eGuardian eGuardian is the name of an FBI system, launched in January 2009, to share tips about possible terror threats with local police agencies. The program aims to get law enforcement at all levels sharing data quickly about suspicious activity and people.eGuardian enables near real time sharing and tracking of terror information and suspicious activities with local, state, tribal, and federal agencies. The eGuardian system is a spin off of a similar but classified tool called Guardian that has been used inside the FBI, and shared with vetted partners since 2005.  Controversies  Throughout its history, the FBI has been the subject of many controversies, both at home and abroad. Files on Puerto Rican independence advocates Congressman Luiz Gutierrez revealed that Pedro Albizu Campos and his Nationalist political party had been watched for a decade long period in the 1930s. The Whitey Bulger case The FBI was, and continues to be, criticized for its handling of Boston criminal Whitey Bulger. As a result of Bulger acting as an informant, the agency turned a blind eye to his activities as an exchange. Latin America For decades during the Cold War, the FBI placed agents to monitor the governments of Caribbean and Latin American nations. Domestic surveillance In 1985, it was found that the FBI had made use of surveillance devices on numerous American citizens between 1940 and 1960. Robert Hanssen In what is described by the US Department of Justice as possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history . Hanssen managed to evade the FBI as he simultaneously sold thousands of classified American documents to Soviet intelligence operatives. Viola Liuzzo Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informant who at the time was also an active member of the Ku Klux Klan, assisted in the murder of Viola Liuzzo in 1965, and afterwards, defamatory rumors were spread by the Bureau about the victim. Ruby Ridge was a shootout between the FBI and Randy Weaver over his failure to appear for weapons charges. Waco siege was a failed raid by the ATF that resaulted in the death of 4 ATF agents and 6 Branch Davidians. The FBI and US military got involved with the 51 day siege that followed. The building ended up burning down killing 76 including 26 children. This is what motivated Timothy McVeigh to carry out the Oklahoma City bombing . Associated Press impersonation case A Bureau agent, masquerading as an AP journalist, placed surveillance software in the personal computer of a minor. This resulted in a series of conflicts between the news agency and the FBI. Stoneman Douglas High School shooting A statement from the FBI confirmed that it had failed to act on a tip warning of the possibility of the shooting over a month prior to its occurrence, which may have prevented the tragedy outright.Specific practices include: Internal investigations of shootings A professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha suggested that FBI internal reports found a questionably high number of weapon discharges by its agents to be justified. Covert operations on political groups Political groups deemed disruptive have been investigated and discredited by the FBI in the aim of protecting national security, preventing violence, and maintaining the existing social and political order. FBI surveillance since 2010 In the years since 2010, it has been uncovered by various civil liberties groups that the FBI earmarked disproportionate resources for the surveillance of left leaning movements and political organizations. The FBI has also committed several breaches of the First Amendment in this time. Files on U.S. citizens The Bureau kept files on certain individuals for varying reasons and lengths of time, notably, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, John Denver.  Media portrayal  The FBI has been frequently depicted in popular media since the 1930s. The bureau has participated to varying degrees, which has ranged from direct involvement in the creative process of film or TV series development, to providing consultation on operations and closed cases. A few of the notable portrayals of the FBI on television are the series The X Files, which started in 1993 and concluded its eleventh season in early 2018, and concerned investigations into paranormal phenomena by five fictional special agents, and the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit agency in the TV drama 24, which is patterned after the FBI Counterterrorism Division. The 1991 movie Point Break depicts an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated a gang of bank robbers. The 1997 movie Donnie Brasco is based on the true story of undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone infiltrating the Mafia. The 2005 2020 television series Criminal Minds, that follows the team members of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit in the pursuit of serial killers. The 2017 TV series Riverdale where one of the main characters is an FBI agent. The 2015 TV series Quantico, titled after the location of the Bureau's training facility, deals with probationary and special agents, not all of whom, within the show's format, may be fully reliable or even trustworthy. The 2018 series FBI, set in NYC that follows the personal and professional lives of the agents assigned to 26 Federal Plaza . FBI's first spin off titled FBI: Most Wanted , follows the FBI's Fugitive Task Force in chasing down the US's most wanted criminals, and the second spin off, FBI: International , follows the FBI's International Fly Team that goes where ever they're needed in the world to protect the US's interests.

It stretches north from Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village to West 143rd Street in Harlem. It is one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world.Fifth Avenue carries two way traffic from 142nd to 135th Street and carries one way traffic southbound for the remainder of its route. The entire street used to carry two way traffic until 1966. From 124th to 120th Street, Fifth Avenue is cut off by Marcus Garvey Park, with southbound traffic diverted around the park via Mount Morris Park West. Most of the avenue has a bus lane, though not a bike lane. Fifth Avenue is the traditional route for many celebratory parades in New York City, and is closed on several Sundays per year. Fifth Avenue was originally only a narrower thoroughfare but the section south of Central Park was widened in 1908. The midtown blocks between 34th and 59th Streets were largely a residential area until the turn of the 20th century, when they were developed as commercial areas. The section of Fifth Avenue in the 50s is consistently ranked among the most expensive shopping streets in the world, and the section between 59th and 96th Streets across Central Park was nicknamed Millionaire's Row in the early 20th century due to the high concentration of mansions there. A section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 110th Streets, also alongside Central Park, is also nicknamed Museum Mile due to the large number of museums there.  History   Early history  Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and Central Park South was relatively undeveloped through the late 19th century.: 2 The surrounding area was once part of the common lands of the city of New York, which was allocated all the waste, vacant, unpatented, and unappropriated lands as a result of the 1686 Dongan Charter. The city's Common Council came to own a large amount of land, primarily in the middle of the island away from the Hudson and East Rivers, as a result of grants by the Dutch provincial government to the colony of New Amsterdam. Although originally more extensive, by 1785 the council held approximately 1,300 acres , or about 9 percent of the island.The lots along what is now Fifth Avenue were laid out in the late 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.: 2 The city's Common Council had, starting in June 1785, attempted to raise money by selling property. The land that the Council owned was not suitable for farming or residential estates, and it was also far away from any roads or waterways. To divide the common lands into sellable lots, and to lay out roads to service them, the Council hired Casimir Goerck to survey them. Goerck was instructed to make lots of about 5 acres each and to lay out roads to access the lots. He completed his task in December 1785, creating 140 lots of varying sizes, oriented with the east west axis longer than the north south axis. As part of the plan, Goerck drew up a street called Middle Road, which eventually became Fifth Avenue.The topography of the lots contributed to the public's reluctance to buy the lots. By 1794, with the city growing ever more populated and the inhabited area constantly moving north towards the Common Lands, the Council decided to try again, hiring Goerck once more to re survey and map the area. He was instructed to make the lots more uniform and rectangular and to lay out roads to the west and east of Middle Road, as well as to lay out east west streets of 60 feet each. Goerck's East and West Roads later became Fourth and Sixth Avenues, while Goerck's cross streets became the modern day numbered east west streets. Goerck took two years to survey the 212 lots which encompassed the entire Common Lands. The Commissioners' Plan of 1811, which prescribed the street plan for Manhattan, was heavily inspired from Goerck's two surveys.: 9  19th century  From the early 19th century, some plots on Fifth Avenue in Midtown were acquired by the wealthy and by institutions. In the mid 19th century, Fifth Avenue between 40th and 59th Streets was home to several institutions such as the Colored Orphan Asylum, the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, and St. Luke's Hospital.: 2 : 282 283 Other uses such as a cattle farm remained until the 1860s.: 2 The portion of Fifth Avenue in Midtown became an upscale residential area following the American Civil War.: 2 : 578 Among the first people to develop such structures was Mary Mason Jones, who built the Marble Row on the eastern side of Fifth Avenue from 57th to 58th Streets between 1868 and 1870.: 578 Her sister Rebecca Colford Jones erected ornate houses of her own one block south.: 2 : 578 Further development came in the late 1870s with the construction of three Vanderbilt family residences along Fifth Avenue between 51st and 59th Streets .: 578, 580 In the 1880s and 1890s, the ten blocks of Fifth Avenue south of Central Park were known as Vanderbilt Row .: 3 The Vanderbilts' relocation prompted many business owners on Fifth Avenue between Madison Square and 34th Street to move uptown.: 581 The upper section of Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side, facing the newly created Central Park, was not developed at that time because of what the Real Estate Record and Guide described as the presence of no opposite neighbors , as the Upper West Side was not yet developed.: 580 581  Early 20th century  The midtown blocks were largely a residential area until the turn of the 20th century, when they were developed as commercial areas. As early as 1900, rising traffic led to proposals to restrict traffic on the avenue. The section south of Central Park was widened starting in 1908, sacrificing wide sidewalks to accommodate the increasing traffic. As part of the widening project, the New York City government ordered the removal of stoops and other encroachments onto the sidewalk in February 1908. The buildings that needed to be trimmed included the Waldorf Astoria hotel. By early 1911, the avenue had been widened south of 47th Street. Later that year, when widening commenced on the section between 47th and 59th Streets, many of the mansions on that stretch of Fifth Avenue were truncated or demolished. In addition, the front facades of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church were relocated, and the gardens in front of the St. Regis and Gotham hotels had to be destroyed. The first commercial building on Fifth Avenue was erected by Benjamin Altman who bought the corner lot on the northeast corner of 34th Street in 1896. The B. Altman and Company Building was erected between 1906 and 1914, occupying the whole of its block front. The result was the creation of a high end shopping district that attracted fashionable women and the upscale stores that wished to serve them.: 266 The Lord Taylor Building, formerly Lord Taylor's flagship store and now a WeWork office, was built at Fifth Avenue and 38th Street in 1914. The Saks Fifth Avenue Building, serving as Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship, opened between 49th and 50th Streets in 1924. The Bergdorf Goodman Building between 57th and 58th Streets, the flagship of Bergdorf Goodman, opened in stages between 1928 and 1929.: 2 By the 1920s, Fifth Avenue was the most active area for development in Midtown, and developers were starting to build north of 45th Street, which had previously been considered the boundary for profitable developments.: 2 3 : 14 15 The most active year for construction in that decade was 1926, when thirty office buildings were constructed on Fifth Avenue.: 2 : 14 The two block wide area between Fifth and Park Avenues, which represented eight percent of Manhattan's land area, contained 25 of developments that commenced between 1924 and 1926.In the 1920s, traffic towers controlled important intersections along the lower portion of Fifth Avenue. The idea of using patrolmen to control traffic at busy Fifth Avenue intersections was introduced as early as 1914. The first such towers were installed in 1920 upon a gift by Dr. John A. Harriss, who paid for patrolmen's sheds in the middle of Fifth Avenue at 34th, 38th, 42nd, 50th and 57th Streets. Two years later, the Fifth Avenue Association gave seven 23 foot high bronze traffic towers, designed by Joseph H. Freedlander, at important intersections between 14th and 57th Streets for a total cost of 126,000. The traffic signals reduced travel time along Fifth Avenue between 34th and 57th Streets, from 40 minutes before the installation of the traffic towers to 15 minutes afterward. Freedlander's towers were removed in 1929 after they were deemed to be obstacles to the movement of traffic. He was commissioned to design bronze traffic signals at the corners of these intersections, with statues of Mercury atop the signals. The Mercury signals survived through 1964, and some of the statues were restored in 1971.  Mid 20th century to present  In 1954, rising traffic led to a proposal to limit use of the avenue to buses and taxis only. On January 14, 1966, Fifth Avenue below 135th Street was changed to carry only one way traffic southbound, and Madison Avenue was changed to one way northbound. Both avenues had previously carried bidirectional traffic.Through the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the upscale retailers that once lined Fifth Avenue's midtown section moved away or closed altogether.: 390 According to a 1971 survey of the avenue, conducted by the Office of Midtown Planning under the leadership of Jaquelin T. Robertson, only 57 percent of building frontages between 34th and 57th Street were used as stores. The remaining frontage, including was used for companies such as banks and airline ticket offices. The section between 34th and 42nd Street, once the main shopping district on Fifth Avenue, was identified in the survey as being in decline. The section between 42nd and 50th Street was characterized as having almost no ground level retail. The section between 50th Street and Grand Army Plaza was identified as having a robust retail corridor that was starting to decay.: 390 In February 1971, New York City mayor John Lindsay proposed a special zoning district to preserve the retail character of Fifth Avenue's midtown section. The legislation prescribed a minimum percentage of retail space for new buildings on Fifth Avenue, but it also provided bonuses , such as additional floor area, for buildings that had more than the minimum amount of retail. The legislation also encouraged the construction of several mixed use buildings with retail at the lowest stories, offices at the middle stories, and apartments at the top stories. The types of retail included in this legislation were strictly defined; for example, airline ticket offices and banks did not count toward the retail space. Furthermore, new skyscrapers on the eastern side of the avenue were allowed to be built up to the boundary of the sidewalk. To align with the buildings of Rockefeller Center, new buildings on the western side had to contain a setback at least 50 feet deep at a height of 85 feet or lower.: 390, 392 The New York City Planning Commission approved this legislation in March 1971. The legislation was adopted that April. Just before the legislation was enacted, American Airlines leased a ground level storefront on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street; Robertson initially disputed the move, even though it had been finalized before the legislation was proposed.: 392 In 1998, a midblock crosswalk was installed south of the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 50th Street, part of an experiment to allow vehicular traffic to turn without conflicting with pedestrians. At the time, it was one of a few midblock crosswalks in the city. The former southern crosswalk at Fifth Avenue and 50th Street was fenced off. A similar crosswalk was later installed south of 49th Street. Both crosswalks were removed in 2019.  Description Fifth Avenue originates at Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village and runs northwards through the heart of Midtown, along the eastern side of Central Park, where it forms the boundary of the Upper East Side and through Harlem, where it terminates at the Harlem River at 142nd Street. Traffic crosses the river on the Madison Avenue Bridge. Fifth Avenue serves as the dividing line for house numbering and west east streets in Manhattan; for example, it separates East 59th Street from West 59th Street. Higher numbered avenues such as Sixth Avenue are to the west of Fifth Avenue, while lower numbered avenues such as Third Avenue are to the east. Address numbers on west east streets increase in both directions as one moves away from Fifth Avenue. A hundred street address numbers were provided for every block to the east or west of Fifth Avenue; for instance, the addresses on West 50th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues were numbered 1 99 West 50th Street, and between Sixth and Seventh Avenues 100 199 West 50th Street. The building lot numbering system worked similarly on the East Side before Madison and Lexington Avenues were added to the street grid laid out in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. Unlike at other avenues, west east street addresses do not increment to the next hundred to the east of Madison and Lexington Avenues. The most expensive street in the world moniker changes depending on currency fluctuations and local economic conditions from year to year. For several years starting in the mid 1990s, the shopping district between 49th and 57th Streets was ranked as having the world's most expensive retail spaces on a cost per square foot basis. In 2008, Forbes magazine ranked Fifth Avenue as being the most expensive street in the world. Some of the most coveted real estate on Fifth Avenue are the penthouses perched atop the buildings.The American Planning Association compiled a list of 2012 Great Places in America and declared Fifth Avenue to be one of the greatest streets to visit in America. This historic street has many world renowned museums, businesses and stores, parks, luxury apartments, and historical landmarks that are reminiscent of its history and vision for the future.  Traffic pattern  Fifth Avenue from 142nd Street to 135th Street carries two way traffic. Fifth Avenue carries one way traffic southbound from 143rd Street to 142nd Street and from 135th Street to Washington Square North. The changeover to one way traffic south of 135th Street took place on January 14, 1966, at which time Madison Avenue was changed to one way uptown . From 124th Street to 120th Street, Fifth Avenue is cut off by Marcus Garvey Park, with southbound traffic diverted around the park via Mount Morris Park West.  Parade route  Fifth Avenue is the traditional route for many celebratory parades in New York City; thus, it is closed to traffic on numerous Sundays in warm weather. The longest running parade is the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. Parades held are distinct from the ticker tape parades held on the Canyon of Heroes on lower Broadway, and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade held on Broadway from the Upper West Side downtown to Herald Square. Fifth Avenue parades usually proceed from south to north, with the exception of the LGBT Pride March, which goes north to south to end in Greenwich Village. The Latino literary classic by New Yorker Giannina Braschi, entitled Empire of Dreams , takes place on the Puerto Rican Day Parade on Fifth Avenue.  Bicycling route  Bicycling on Fifth Avenue ranges from segregated with a bike lane south of 23rd Street, to scenic along Central Park, to dangerous through Midtown with very heavy traffic during rush hours. There is no dedicated bike lane along most of Fifth Avenue. A protected bike lane south of 23rd Street was added in 2017, and another protected lane for bidirectional bike traffic between 110th and 120th Streets was announced in 2020.In July 1987, then New York City Mayor Edward Koch proposed banning bicycling on Fifth, Park, and Madison Avenues during weekdays, but many bicyclists protested and had the ban overturned. When the trial was started on August 24, 1987, for 90 days to ban bicyclists from these three avenues from 31st Street to 59th Street between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on weekdays, mopeds would not be banned. On August 31, 1987, a state appeals court judge halted the ban for at least a week pending a ruling after opponents against the ban brought a lawsuit.  Public transportation   Bus  Fifth Avenue is one of the few major streets in Manhattan along which streetcars did not operate. Instead, transportation along Fifth Avenue was initially provided by the Fifth Avenue Transportation Company, which provided horse drawn service from 1885 to 1896. It was replaced by Fifth Avenue Coach, which continued to offer bus service. Double decker buses were operated by the Fifth Avenue Coach Company until 1953 and again by MTA Regional Bus Operations from 1976 to 1978.A bus lane for Fifth Avenue within Midtown was announced in 1982. Initially it ran from 59th to 34th Streets. The bus lane opened in June 1983 and was restricted to buses on weekdays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. In June 2020, mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would test out busways on Fifth Avenue from 57th to 34th Street. Despite a deadline of October 2020, the Fifth Avenue busway was not in place at that time.Today, local bus service along Fifth Avenue is provided by the MTA's M1, M2, M3, and M4 buses. The M5 and Q32 also run on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, while the M55 runs on Fifth Avenue south of 44th Street. Numerous express buses from Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island also run along Fifth Avenue.  Subway  The New York City Subway has never built a line underneath Fifth Avenue, likely because wealthy Fifth Avenue residents would have objected to any such line. However, there are several subway stations along streets that cross Fifth Avenue: N, R, and W at Fifth Avenue 59th Street E and M at Fifth Avenue 53rd Street 7 and 7 at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street R and W at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street  Nicknames   Upper Fifth Avenue Millionaire's Row  In the late 19th century, the very rich of New York began building mansions along the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 59th Street and 96th Street, looking onto Central Park. By the early 20th century, the portion of Fifth Avenue between 59th and 96th Streets had been nicknamed Millionaire's Row , with mansions such as the Mrs. William B. Astor House and William A. Clark House. Entries to Central Park along this stretch include Inventor's Gate at 72nd Street, which gave access to the park's carriage drives, and Engineers' Gate at 90th Street, used by equestrians. A milestone change for Fifth Avenue came in 1916, when the grand corner mansion at 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue that James A. Burden Jr. had erected in 1893 became the first private mansion on Fifth Avenue above 59th Street to be demolished to make way for a grand apartment house. The building at 907 Fifth Avenue began a trend, with its 12 stories around a central court, with two apartments to a floor. Its strong cornice above the fourth floor, just at the eaves height of its neighbors, was intended to soften its presence. In January 1922, the city reacted to complaints about the ongoing replacement of Fifth Avenue's mansions by apartment buildings by restricting the height of future structures to 75 feet , about half the height of a ten story apartment building. Architect J. E. R. Carpenter brought suit, and won a verdict overturning the height restriction in 1923. Carpenter argued that the avenue would be greatly improved in appearance when deluxe apartments would replace the old style mansions. Led by real estate investors Benjamin Winter, Sr. and Frederick Brown, the old mansions were quickly torn down and replaced with apartment buildings.This area contains many notable apartment buildings, including 810 Fifth Avenue and the Park Cinq, many of them built in the 1920s by architects such as Rosario Candela and J. E. R. Carpenter. A very few post World War II structures break the unified limestone frontage, notably the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum between 88th and 89th Streets.  Museum Mile  Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 110th streets on the Upper East Side, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile . Nine museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. A ninth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009; its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012. In addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival to promote the museums and increase visitation. The Museum Mile Festival traditionally takes place here on the second Tuesday in June from 6 9 p.m. It was established in 1979 by Lisa Taylor to increase public awareness of its member institutions and promote public support of the arts in New York City. The first festival was held on June 26, 1979 . The nine museums are open free that evening to the public. Several of the participating museums offer outdoor art activities for children, live music and street performers. During the event, Fifth Avenue is closed to traffic. Museums on the mile include: 110th Street The Africa Center 105th Street El Museo del Barrio 103rd Street Museum of the City of New York 92nd Street The Jewish Museum 91st Street Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum 89th Street National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts 88th Street Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 86th Street Neue Galerie New York 82nd Street The Metropolitan Museum of ArtFurther south, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, lies the Henry Clay Frick House, which houses the Frick Collection.  Historical landmarks  Buildings on Fifth Avenue can have one of several types of official landmark designations: The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is the New York City agency that is responsible for identifying and designating the city's landmarks and the buildings in the city's historic districts. New York City landmarks can be categorized into one of several groups: individual , interior, and scenic landmarks. The National Register of Historic Places is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance. The National Historic Landmark focuses on places of significance in American history, architecture, engineering, or culture; all NHL sites are also on the NRHP. World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO as having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance, and are legally protected by international treaties.  Individual landmarks  Below is a list of historic sites on Fifth Avenue, from north to south. Historic districts are not included in this table, but are mentioned in Historic districts. Buildings within historic districts, but no individual landmark designation, are not included in this table.  Historic districts  There are numerous historic districts through which Fifth Avenue passes. Buildings in these districts with individual landmark designations are described in Individual landmarks. From north to south, the districts are: The Carnegie Hill Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 400 buildings, primarily along Fifth Avenue from 86th to 98th Street, as well as on side streets extending east to Madison, Park, and Lexington Avenues.: 3 The Metropolitan Museum Historic District, a city landmark district, which consists of properties on Fifth Avenue between 79th and 86th Streets, outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as properties on several side streets.: 2 The Upper East Side Historic District, a city and NRHP district. The city district runs from 59th to 78th Streets along Fifth Avenue, and up to Third Avenue at some points.: 3 : 4 The Madison Square North Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 96 buildings from 25th to 29th Streets around Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and side streets. The Ladies' Mile Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers 440 buildings from roughly 15th Street to 24th Street and from Park Avenue South to west of Sixth Avenue. The Greenwich Village Historic District, a city landmark district, which covers much of Greenwich Village and includes almost all buildings on Fifth Avenue south of 12th Street.In the 1980s, there was also a proposal for a historic district on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 58th Streets. At the time, St. Patrick's Cathedral, St. Thomas Church, the Cartier Building at number 651, the University Club, the Rizzoli Building at number 712, and the Coty Building at number 714 were official city landmarks. However, other structures on that strip had no protection yet, including Rockefeller Center, the Elizabeth Arden Building at 689 Fifth Avenue, the St. Regis Hotel, the Peninsula Hotel, and the Bergdorf Goodman Building.  Other  In addition, the cooperative apartment building at 2 Fifth Avenue was named a New York cultural landmark on December 12, 2013, by the Historic Landmark Preservation Center, as the last residence of former New York City Mayor Ed Koch.  Economy  Between 49th Street and 60th Street, Fifth Avenue is lined with prestigious boutiques and flagship stores and is consistently ranked among the most expensive shopping streets in the world.Many luxury goods, fashion, and sport brand boutiques are on Fifth Avenue, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany Co. , Gucci, Prada, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Cartier, Omega, Chanel, Harry Winston, Salvatore Ferragamo, Nike, Escada, Rolex, Bvlgari, Emilio Pucci, Ermenegildo Zegna, Abercrombie Fitch, Hollister Co., De Beers, Emanuel Ungaro, Gap, Versace, Lindt Chocolate Shop, Henri Bendel, NBA Store, Oxxford Clothes, Microsoft Store, Sephora, Tourneau, and Wempe. Luxury department stores include Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. Fifth Avenue also is home to an Apple Store. Many airlines at one time had ticketing offices along Fifth Avenue. In the years leading up to 1992, the number of ticketing offices along Fifth Avenue decreased. Pan American World Airways went out of business, while Air France, Finnair, and KLM moved their ticket offices to other areas in Midtown Manhattan.

            "text": "Fiorello Henry La Guardia was an American attorney and politician who represented New York in the House of Representatives and served as the 99th Mayor of New York City from 1934 to 1945. Known for his irascible, energetic, and charismatic personality and diminutive, rotund stature, La Guardia is acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history. La Guardia was frequently cross endorsed by parties other than his own, including the Democratic Party, under New York's electoral fusion laws. Before serving as mayor, La Guardia represented Manhattan in Congress and on the New York City Board of Aldermen. As mayor, during the Great Depression and World War II, La Guardia unified the city's transit system; expanded construction of public housing, playgrounds, parks, and airports; reorganized the New York Police Department; and implemented federal New Deal programs within the city. He pursued a long series of political reforms, curbing the power of the powerful Tammany Hall political machine and re establishing merit based employment and promotion within city administration.La Guardia was also a major national political figure. His support for the New Deal and relationship with President Franklin D. Roosevelt crossed party lines, brought federal funds to New York City, and cut off patronage to La Guardia's enemies. La Guardia's WNYC radio program Talk to the People , which aired from December 1941 until December 1945, expanded his public influence beyond the borders of the city.  Early life and career La Guardia was born in Greenwich Village, New York City, on December 12, 1882. His father, Achille La Guardia, was a Catholic native of Cerignola, Apulia, Italy. His father was an Italian immigrant to the United States and a non practicing Catholic. His mother, Irene Luzzatto Coen, was a Jewish native of Trieste, then part of the Austro Hungarian Empire. His maternal grandmother Fiorina Coen was a Luzzatto, a member of the prestigious Italian Jewish family of scholars, kabbalists, and poets. La Guardia's parents met and married in Trieste. Fiorello was raised an Episcopalian and practiced that religion all his life. His middle name Enrico was eventually anglicized to Henry .He moved to Arizona in 1890 with his family, where his father had a bandmaster position at Fort Whipple in the U.S. Army. La Guardia attended public schools and high school in Prescott, Arizona. After his father was discharged from his bandmaster position in 1898, Fiorello lived in Trieste. He graduated from the Dwight School, a private school on the Upper West Side of New York City.La Guardia joined the State Department in 1901 and served in U.S. consulates in Budapest, Trieste, and Fiume. In 1906, he returned to the United States to continue his education at New York University. While studying at NYU from 1907 to 1910, he worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Bureau of Immigration at the Ellis Island immigration station. La Guardia was fluent in Italian, Yiddish, and Croatian.He graduated from New York University School of Law in 1910, was admitted to the bar the same year, and began a law practice in New York City.  Early political career   Election to Congress and World War I  In 1914, La Guardia ran for U.S. Representative for New York's 14th district, which stretched across the island of Manhattan between 3rd and 14th Streets, encompassing Greenwich Village. La Guardia was defeated by Michael F. Farley.La Guardia became Deputy Attorney General of New York in January 1915. In 1916, he challenged Farley again, this time successfully. La Guardia took office on March 4, 1917, but was soon commissioned into the United States Army Air Service amid the American entry into World War I. He rose to the rank of major in command of a unit of Caproni Ca.44 bombers on the Italian Austrian front. He was re elected to Congress in 1918.  President of the Board of Aldermen   1919 special election  In 1919, New York City Board of Aldermen President Al Smith resigned to become Governor of New York, triggering a special election scheduled for the fall. La Guardia narrowly won the Republican nomination over William M. Bennett, who had been the party nominee for Mayor in 1917. La Guardia's opponent in the November special election was Robert L. Moran, a Tammany Hall aligned Democratic alderman from the Bronx, who had filled the seat since Smith's resignation.La Guardia benefited from the presence of Michael Dynamite Mike Kelly, commander in the Irish heritage 69th New York Infantry Regiment, in the race. Tammany Hall tried to persuade Kelly to withdraw his candidacy and support Moran. When he refused, Tammany went to the New York Supreme Court and successfully sued to keep Kelly's name off the ballot.When Election Day arrived, over 3,500 of Kelly's supporters wrote Kelly's name on the ballot. Another 129,000 votes were cast for Socialist James O'Neal. La Guardia won narrowly by 1,363 votes.He resigned from Congress on December 31, 1919, to take office as president the next day.  1921 mayoral election  In 1921, La Guardia made his first bid for Mayor of New York City, but was defeated in the Republican primary by Manhattan Borough President Henry H. Curran. Curran lost the general election to Mayor John Hylan in a landslide.  Return to Congress from Harlem  Running as a Republican, La Guardia won a seat in Congress from the Italian stronghold of East Harlem in 1922 and served in the House until March 3, 1933. He gained a reputation as a fiery and devoted reformer. La Guardia sponsored labor legislation and railed against immigration quotas. His major legislation was the Norris La Guardia Act, cosponsored with Nebraska senator George Norris in 1932. It circumvented Supreme Court limitations on the activities of labor unions, especially as those limitations were imposed between the enactment of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914 and the end of the 1920s. Based on the theory that the lower courts are creations not of the Constitution but of Congress, and that Congress therefore has wide power in defining and restricting their jurisdiction, the act forbids issuance of injunctions to sustain anti union contracts of employment, to prevent ceasing or refusing to perform any work or remain in any relation of employment, or to restrain acts generally constituting component parts of strikes, boycotts, and picketing. It also said courts could no longer enforce yellow dog contracts, which are labor contracts prohibiting a worker from joining a union.As a Republican, La Guardia had to support Harding in 1920; he had to be silent in the 1928 campaign although he favored Al Smith, a Democrat.  1929 mayoral election  In 1929, La Guardia ran for Mayor once again. This time, he received the Republican nomination, once again defeating William Bennett. However, he lost the general election to incumbent Jimmy Walker in a landslide.  Mayor of New York   1933 mayoral election  Mayor Jimmy Walker and his Irish run Tammany Hall were forced out of office by scandal and La Guardia was determined to replace him. La Guardia ran on the Fusion Party platform, which was supported by Republicans, reform minded Democrats, and independents. La Guardia had enormous determination, high visibility, the support of reformer Samuel Seabury and a divisive primary contest. He also represented previously underrepresented communities, appealed to a wide range of cultural backgrounds with his lineage. He secured the nominations and expected an easy win against incumbent Mayor John P. O'Brien. However, Joseph V. McKee entered the race as the nominee of the new Recovery Party at the last minute. McKee was a formidable opponent, sponsored by Bronx Democratic boss Edward J. Flynn. La Guardia promised a more honest government, championing for greater efficiency and inclusiveness. La Guardia's win was based on a complex coalition of Republicans , a minority of reform minded Democrats, Socialists, a large proportion of middle class Jews, and the great majority of Italians, whose votes had previously been overwhelmingly loyal Tammany.  Agenda  La Guardia came to office in January 1934 with five main goals: Restore the financial health and break free from the bankers' control Expand the federally funded work relief program for the unemployed End corruption in government and racketeering in key sectors of the economy Replace patronage with a merit based civil service, with high prestige Modernize the infrastructure, especially transportation and parksHe achieved most of the first four goals in his first hundred days, as FDR gave him 20 of the entire national CWA budget for work relief. La Guardia then collaborated closely with Robert Moses, with support from the governor, Democrat Herbert Lehman, to upgrade the decaying infrastructure. The city was favored by the New Deal in terms of funding for public works projects. La Guardia's modernization efforts were publicized in the 1936 book New York Advancing: A Scientific Approach to Municipal Government, edited by Rebecca B. Rankin.  African American politics  In 1935 a riot took place in Harlem. Termed the Harlem riot of 1935, it has been described as the first modern race riot, because it was committed primarily against property rather than persons. During the riots, La Guardia and Hubert Delany walked through the streets in an effort to calm the situation. After the riots, La Guardia convened the Mayor's Commission on Conditions of Harlem to determine the causes of the riot and a detailed report was prepared. The report identified injustices of discrimination in employment, the aggressions of the police, and the racial segregation as conditions which led to the outbreak of rioting. However, the Mayor shelved the committee's report, and did not make it public. The report would be unknown, except that a black New York newspaper, the Amsterdam News, subsequently published it in serial form.  Ethnic politics  La Guardia governed in an uneasy alliance with New York's Jews and liberal WASPs, together with ethnic Italians and Germans.Not an orthodox Republican, he also ran as the nominee of the American Labor Party, a union dominated anti Tammany left wing group that supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for president beginning in 1936. La Guardia supported Roosevelt, chairing the Committee of Independent Voters for Roosevelt and his running mate, Henry A. Wallace, with Senator George Norris during the 1940 presidential election. La Guardia was the city's first Italian American mayor, but was not a typical Italian New Yorker. He was a Republican Episcopalian who had grown up in Arizona and had a Triestine Jewish mother and a lapsed Catholic father. He spoke several languages; when working at Ellis Island, he was certified as an interpreter for Italian, German, Yiddish, and Croatian. It served him well during a contentious congressional campaign in 1922. When Henry Frank, a Jewish opponent, accused him of anti Semitism, La Guardia rejected the suggestion that he publicly disclose that his mother was Jewish as self serving . Instead, La Guardia dictated an open letter in Yiddish that was also printed in Yiddish. In it, he challenged Frank to publicly and openly debate the issues of the campaign entirely in the Yiddish language. Frank, although he was Jewish, could not speak the language and was forced to decline and lost the election.La Guardia's 1933 campaign coincided with the rise of racial and religious hostilities in Germany, and he supported a more anti Nazi response while in office. He publicly supported groups that engaged in boycotts of German goods and spoke alongside Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, leader of the American Jewish Congress. In 1935, La Guardia caused an international stir when he denied a masseur license to a German immigrant, stating that Germany had violated a treaty guaranteeing equal treatment of American professionals by discriminating against American Jews. Despite threats from Germany , La Guardia continued to use his position as mayor to denounce Nazism. During his reelection campaign in 1937, speaking before the Women's Division of the American Jewish Congress, he called for the creation of a special pavilion at the upcoming New York World's Fair, a chamber of horrors for that brown shirted fanatic, referring to Hitler. He also led anti Nazi rallies and promoted legislation to facilitate the U.S. rescue of the Jewish refugees. He also appointed more racially and religiously diverse judges to various New York courts, which was one of his most powerful weapons against Nazi prejudice. These appointments included Rosalie Loew Whitney, Herbert O'Brien, Jane Bolin, and Hubert Thomas Delany. LaGuardia would soon regret appointing the Catholic O'Brien, who engaged in reactionary politics on the bench including decrying support for the Allied forces against the Axis in 1941, leading to LaGuardia's condemnation of him with the famous line, Senator, I have made a lot of good appointments and I think I am good ... but when I make a mistake, it s a beaut.  Crime  La Guardia criticized the gangsters who brought a negative stereotype and shame to the Italian community. His first action as mayor was to order the chief of police to arrest mob boss Lucky Luciano on whatever charges could be found. La Guardia then went after the gangsters with a vengeance, stating in a radio address to the people of New York in his distinct voice, Let's drive the bums out of town. In 1934 he went on a search and destroy mission looking for mob boss Frank Costello's slot machines, rounding up thousands of the one armed bandits, swinging a sledgehammer and dumping them off a barge into the water for the newspapers and media. In 1935 La Guardia appeared at the Bronx Terminal Market to institute a citywide ban on the sale, display, and possession of artichokes, whose prices were inflated by mobsters. When prices went down, the ban was lifted. In 1936, La Guardia had special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, a future Republican presidential candidate, single out Lucky Luciano for prosecution. Dewey led a successful investigation into Luciano's lucrative prostitution operation, eventually sending Luciano to jail with a 30 50 year sentence. The case was made into the 1937 movie Marked Woman, starring Bette Davis. La Guardia proved successful in shutting down the burlesque theaters, whose shows offended his sensibilities.  Public works  La Guardia's admirers credit him, among other things, with restoring the economy of New York City during and after the Great Depression. He is given credit for many massive public works programs administered by his powerful Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, which employed thousands of voters. The mayor's relentless lobbying for federal funds allowed New York to develop its economic infrastructure.To obtain large scale federal money the mayor became a close ally of Roosevelt and New Deal agencies such as the CWA, PWA, and WPA, which poured 1.1 billion into the city from 1934 to 1939. In turn he gave FDR a showcase for New Deal achievement, helped defeat FDR's political enemies in Tammany Hall . He and Moses built highways, bridges and tunnels, transforming the physical landscape of New York City. The West Side Highway, East River Drive, Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, Triborough Bridge, and two airports were built during his mayoralty.In 1943, La Guardia saved the Mecca Temple on 55th Street from demolition. Together with New York City Council President Newbold Morris, La Guardia converted the building to the New York City Center of Music and Dance. On December 11, 1943, City Center opened its doors with a concert from the New York Philharmonic La Guardia even conducted a rendition of The Star Spangled Banner.  1939  1939 was a busy year, as he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, opened New York Municipal Airport No. 2 in Queens , and had the city buy out the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Corporation, thus completing the public takeover of the New York City Subway system. The U.S. arrival of Georg and Maria Von Trapp and their children from Austria that fall at Ellis Island who would eventually become the Trapp Family Singers was another significant decade ending event that year in La Guardia's mayoralty.  Reform  Responding to popular disdain for the sometimes corrupt City Council, La Guardia successfully proposed a reformed 1938 City Charter that created a powerful new New York City Board of Estimate, similar to a corporate board of directors.La Guardia was also a supporter of the Ives Quinn Law a law that would ban discrimination in employment on the bases of 'race, creed, color or national origin' and task a new agency, the New York State Commission Against Discrimination , with education and enforcement. The bill passed in 1945, making New York the first state in the country to create an agency tasked with handling employment discrimination complaints.  World War II  In 1941 during the run up to American involvement in World War II, President Roosevelt appointed La Guardia first director of the new Office of Civilian Defense . Roosevelt was an admirer of La Guardia; after meeting Winston Churchill for the first time he described him as an English Mayor La Guardia . The OCD was the national agency responsible for preparing for blackouts, air raid wardens, sirens, and shelters in case of German air raids. The goal was to psychologically mobilize many thousands of middle class volunteers to make them feel part of the war effort. At the urging of aviation advocate Gill Robb Wilson, La Guardia, in his capacity as Director of the OCD, created the Civil Air Patrol with Administrative Order 9, signed by him on December 1, 1941, and published December 8, 1941. La Guardia remained Mayor of New York, shuttling back and forth with three days in Washington and four in the city in an effort to do justice to two herculean jobs. La Guardia focused on setting up air raid systems and training volunteer wardens. However Roosevelt appointed his wife Eleanor Roosevelt as his assistant. She issued calls for actors to lead a volunteer talent program, and dancers to start a physical fitness program. That led to widespread ridicule and the president replaced both of them in December 1941 with a full time director James M. Landis.The war ended the Great Depression in the city. Unemployment ended, and the city was a gateway for military supplies and soldiers sent to Europe, with the Brooklyn Navy Yard providing many of the warships and the garment trade providing uniforms. The city's great financiers, however, were less important in decision making than the policy makers in Washington, and very high wartime taxes were not offset by heavy war spending. New York was not a center of heavy industry and did not see a wartime boom, as defense plants were built elsewhere.FDR refused to make La Guardia a general and was unable to provide fresh money for the city. By 1944 the city was short of funds to pay for La Guardia's new programs. La Guardia was frustrated and his popularity slipped away and he ran so poorly in straw polls in 1945 that he did not run for a fourth term.In July 1945, when the city's newspapers were closed by a strike, La Guardia famously read the comics on the radio.  Political views As a Congressman, La Guardia was a tireless and vocal champion of progressive causes, including relaxed restriction on immigration, removal of U.S. troops from Nicaragua to speaking up for the rights and livelihoods of striking miners, impoverished farmers, oppressed minorities, and struggling families. He supported progressive income taxes, greater government oversight of Wall Street, and national employment insurance for workers idled by the Great Depression.In domestic policies he tended toward socialism and wanted to nationalize and regulate; however he was never close to the Socialist Party and never bothered to read Karl Marx.When Mussolini's Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia on October 3, 1935, a Black protest of Italian vendors at the King Julius General Market on Lenox and 118th Street turned into a riot and 1,200 extra NYC policemen were deployed on war duty to quell the riot. In December 1935, at an Italian American rally, attended by 20,000, in Madison Square Garden, La Guardia presented a 100,000 check to the Italian Consul General, part of a total 700,000 raised from Italian Americans to help fund the invasion.  Foreign policy  Never an isolationist, he supported using American influence abroad on behalf of democracy or for national independence or against autocracy. Thus he supported the Irish independence movement and the anti czarist Russian Revolution of 1917, but did not approve of Vladimir Lenin. By 1946 he was praising Moscow. Unlike most progressive colleagues who were isolationist, La Guardia consistently backed internationalism, speaking in favor of the League of Nations and the Inter Parliamentary Union as well as peace and disarmament conferences.In 1946 President Harry Truman sent the ex mayor as an envoy to Brazil, but diplomacy was not his forte. Truman then gave him as major job as head of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration , with responsibility for helping millions of desperate refugees in Europe. La Guardia was exhausted and after seeing the horrors of war in Europe called for a massive aid program. Critics ridiculed that as worldwide WPA and the biggest boondoggle ever. He sided with Henry A. Wallace in calling for friendship with the Soviet Union, and attacked the new breed of Cold Warriors. He provided UNRRA funds to the Soviets despite warnings that the Kremlin used the money to rebuild its army. UNRRA shut down at the end of 1946. Despite his declining health La Guardia attacked the emerging Truman Doctrine that promised American financial help to stop the spread of Communism.  Prohibition  As Congressman, La Guardia was one of the first Republicans to voice his opinion against prohibition, urging that the Dry cause would prove disastrous in the long run . This was breaking a taboo, given the fact that both parties avoided taking a stand on prohibition issues at the time.  Personal life La Guardia was a Scottish Rite Freemason and was a member of Garibaldi Lodge 542 in New York City.  Family  La Guardia married twice. His first wife was Thea Almerigotti, an Istrian immigrant, whom he married on March 8, 1919. In June 1920, they had a daughter, Fioretta Thea La Guardia, who died May 9, 1921, of spinal meningitis. Thea died of tuberculosis on November 29, 1921, at the age of 26.In 1929, La Guardia remarried to Marie Fisher who had been his secretary while in Congress. They adopted two children: Eric Henry , a Hobart College graduate who became a professor at the University of Washington, Jean Marie , La Guardia's niece from his first marriage, the biological daughter of Thea's sister, a Barnard College graduate who later became an editor of Mademoiselle.  Nazi detention of sister and brother in law  La Guardia's sister, the writer Gemma La Guardia Gluck and brother in law, Herman Gluck were living in Hungary and were arrested by the Gestapo on June 7, 1944, when the Nazis took control of Budapest. Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler knew that Gemma was La Guardia's sister and ordered her to be held as a political prisoner. She and Herman were deported to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. Gemma did not learn until her release that Herman had died at Mauthausen. Gemma was transferred from Mauthausen to the notorious women's concentration camp at Ravensbr ck, fifty miles from Berlin, where unbeknownst to Gemma at the time her daughter Yolanda and baby grandson were also held for a year in a separate barracks. Gemma Gluck, who was held in Block II of the camp and assigned prisoner 44139, was one of the few survivors of Ravensbr ck and wrote about her time there.The Germans abandoned Gluck, her daughter, and her grandson for a possible hostage exchange in April 1945 as the Russians advanced on Berlin. After the liberation of the camps, Gemma later wrote, the Soviets were violating girls and women of all ages, and the three struggled as displaced persons in postwar Berlin, because they did not speak German and had no identity papers, money, or means of documenting where they had been.Gemma finally managed to get word to the Americans, who contacted Fiorello, who was then director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and had been unable to locate his sister and brother in law since their disappearance. He worked to get them on the immigration lists, but asserted in a letter, included in the appendix of Gemma's memoir, that her case was the same as that of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and no exceptions can be made. It took two years for her to be cleared and sent to the United States. She returned to New York in May 1947, where she was reunited with her brother only four months before his death. As he had made no provision for her, she lived the remainder of her life in very reduced circumstances in a public housing project in Queens until her death in 1962.Gluck is one of the few American born women interned by the Nazis, along with Virginia d'Albert Lake.  Death and legacy  A man of short stature, La Guardia's height is sometimes given as 5 feet 0 inches . According to an article in The New York Times; however, his actual height was 5 feet 2 inches .He died of pancreatic cancer in his home at 5020 Goodridge Avenue, in the Fieldston neighbourhood of Riverdale, Bronx, on September 20, 1947, aged 64. La Guardia is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.  Legacy  La Guardia was ranked first among the nation's mayors in a 1993 poll of historians and social scientists.According to biographer Mason B. Williams, his close collaboration with Roosevelt's New Deal proved a striking success in linking national money and local needs. La Guardia enabled the political recognition of new groups that had been largely excluded from the political system, such as Jews and Italians. His administration gave New York its modern infrastructure. His far sighted goals raised ambitions for new levels of urban possibility. According to Thomas Kessner, trends since his tenure mean that people would be afraid of allowing anybody to take that kind of power .  Namesakes  In 1972, the United States Postal Service honored La Guardia with a 14 cent postage stamp. New York's LaGuardia Airport, LaGuardia Community College, and other parks and buildings around New York City are named for him. A strong supporter of Zionism, LaGuardia Street and LaGuardia interchange, both in Tel Aviv, Israel, were named in his honor. A street in Rijeka, Croatia, is named after Fiorello La Guardia. La Guardia worked in Rijeka as a U.S. Consular Agent from 1903 to 1906, when the city was known as Fiume and was under Hungarian administration. It was during this time that Rijeka's port played a vital role in connecting the Austro Hungarian Empire to the United States, featuring direct passenger service between Rijeka and New York. Known for his love of music, La Guardia was noted for spontaneously conducting professional and student orchestras and was instrumental in the creation of the High School of Music Art in 1936, now renamed the Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music Art and Performing Arts.  In popular culture  La Guardia was the subject of the hit 1959 Broadway musical Fiorello! The original production of Fiorello! ran for two years and won 3 Tony Awards, including Best Musical and for Tom Bosley's portrayal of La Guardia, as well as a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1960. Actor Tony Lo Bianco has portrayed La Guardia in several one man plays, beginning with Hizzoner! in 1984. It debuted on Broadway in 1989, and Lo Bianco has since portrayed La Guardia in several off Broadway versions, including LaGuardia and The Little Flower . In Ghostbusters II, La Guardia's ghost talks to New York Mayor Lenny Clotch . In the alternate history drama The Plot Against America , La Guardia is part of the opposition against the fascists in America. In the 2021 film In the Heights, Abuela Claudia refers to dancing with La Guardia during the song Paciencia Y Fe which recounts her early life.The Tammany Hall off Broadway show in NYC depicts La Guardia s 1929 mayoral run against Jimmy Walker.

Initially a St. John Ambulance volunteer, she travelled to the Kingdom of Serbia, where she was welcomed and formally enrolled in the Serbian army. She was subsequently promoted to the rank of Sergeant major, and, after the war, to Captain. She was decorated with seven medals.  Biography   Early life  Flora Sandes was born on 22 January 1876 in Nether Poppleton, Yorkshire, the youngest daughter of an Irish family. Her father was Samuel Dickson Sandes , the former rector of Whitchurch, County Cork, and her mother was Sophia Julia . When she was nine years old, the family moved to Marlesford, Suffolk; and later to Thornton Heath, near Croydon, Surrey. As a child she was educated by governesses. She enjoyed riding and shooting and said that she wished she had been born a boy. She learned to drive, and drove an old French racing car. She took a job as a secretary.In her spare time, Sandes trained with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry , founded in 1907 as an all women mounted paramilitary organisation, learning first aid, horsemanship, signalling and drill. She left the FANY in 1910, joining another renegade, Mabel St Clair Stobart, in the formation of the Women's Sick and Wounded Convoy Corps. The Convoy saw service in Serbia and Bulgaria in 1912 during the First Balkan War. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, she volunteered to become a nurse, but was rejected due to a lack of qualifications.  Military career  Sandes nonetheless joined a St. John Ambulance unit raised by American nurse Mabel Grouitch, and on 12 August 1914 left England for Serbia with a group of 36 women to try to aid the humanitarian crises there. They arrived at the town of Kragujevac which was the base for the Serbian forces fighting against the Austro Hungarian offensive. Sandes joined the Serbian Red Cross and worked in an ambulance for the Serbian Army's 2nd Infantry Regiment. In 1914 she went riding with a Serbian soldier who, impressed with her equestrian skills, told her she was wasted as a nurse and should enlist as a soldier; she told Dr Isabel Emslie, I've always wished to be a soldier and to fight. In 1915 Sandes struggled persistently to get to the front , eventually joining the ambulance of the Second Regiment at the Babuna Pass. During the Great Retreat through Albania, all the other ambulance staff fled or were killed. Sandes could no longer make herself useful as a nurse and was enrolled as a private by General Milo Vasi . She quickly advanced to the rank of Corporal. She recounted later that to formalize the change she removed her Red Cross badge and replaced it with the brass regimental figures from Colonel Milich's epaulettes. In 1916, during the Serbian advance on Bitola , Sandes was seriously wounded by a grenade in hand to hand combat. She subsequently received the highest decoration of the Serbian Military, the Order of the Kara or e's Star. At the same time, she was promoted to the rank of Sergeant major.Also in 1916, Sandes published her autobiography, An English Woman Sergeant in the Serbian Army, based on her letters and diaries. She used this account to help her raise funds for the Serbian Army, and was compared with the writings for Dr Caroline Matthews 'Experiences of a Woman Doctor in Serbia'. With Evelina Haverfield Sandes founded the Hon. Evelina Haverfield's and Sergt Major Flora Sandes' Fund for Promoting Comforts for Serbian Soldiers and Prisoners. Unable to continue fighting due to her injury, she spent the remainder of the war running a hospital. In June 1919, a special Act of Parliament was passed in Serbia that made her the Serbian Army's first female commissioned officer. She was finally demobilised in October 1922.  Later life  In May 1927, Sandes married Yuri Yudenitch, a former Russian White Army general officer. The couple lived for a time in France, but afterwards returned to Serbia , and settled in Belgrade. Among other jobs, Sandes drove Belgrade's first taxicab. Also in 1927, she published a second autobiography. She lectured extensively on her wartime experiences in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France, Canada and the United States. She wore her military uniform while delivering her lectures.When during World War II Germany launched its attack on Yugoslavia in April 1941, Sandes and Yudenitch were recalled to military service, but the invasion was over before they could take up any military duties. They were briefly interned by the Germans, before being released on parole. Yudenitch fell ill, was removed to hospital, and died there in September 1941.Sandes subsequently returned to England. She spent the last years of her life in Suffolk, living at Lower Hacheston near Wickham Market. She died at the East Suffolk and Ipswich Hospital on 24 November 1956: she was cremated at Ipswich Crematorium and her ashes scattered in the Garden of Remembrance. In St Andrew's Church in Marlesford a memorial plaque on the south wall in the choir stalls is dedicated to her.  Legacy  In 1920, the sculptor Alice Meredith Williams made a painted plaster model of Flora Sandes in action for the Imperial War Museum, where it remains. In 2009 a street in Belgrade was named after her. There was formerly a Wetherspoon pub named The Flora Sandes in her honour in Thornton Heath. It closed in 2018.  In popular culture Our Englishwoman, a television film based on the biography of Flora Sandes and directed by Slobodan Radovitch, was produced in 1997 by the Serbian broadcasting service RTS. The last track of the album England Green and England Grey by Reg Meuross is The Ballad of Flora Sandes . It is an interpretation of her life.

There's Archimedes with his leverStill busy on problems as ever.Says: matter and force are transmutableAnd wrong the laws you thought immutable. Below, on Earth, they work at full blastAnd news are coming in thick and fast.The latest tells of a cosmic gun.To be pelted is very poor fun.We are wary with so much at stake,Those beggars are a pest no mistake. Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renownAnd turned your great science upside down.Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,Puts on your high teaching all the blame.Says: matter and force are transmutableAnd wrong the laws you thought immutable. I am much too ignorant, my son,For grasping schemes so finely spun.My followers are of stronger mindAnd I am content to stay behind,Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,These masters of mine may do the rest.Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.When is your friend Tesla coming up. Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,It would be useless to remonstrate. Then silence shuffle of soft slippered feet I knock and the bedlam of the street. Nikola Tesla, Novice  References",

            "text": "Francis Marion Crawford was an American writer noted for his many novels, especially those set in Italy, and for his classic weird and fantastical stories.  Early life Crawford was born in Bagni di Lucca, in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, on August 2, 1854. He was the only son of the American sculptor Thomas Crawford and Louisa Cutler Ward. His sister was the writer Mary Crawford Fraser , and he was the nephew of Julia Ward Howe, the American poet. After his father's death in 1857, his mother remarried to Luther Terry, with whom she had Crawford's half sister, Margaret Ward Terry, who later became the wife of Winthrop Astor Chanler.He studied successively at St Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire; Cambridge University; University of Heidelberg; and the University of Rome.In 1879, he went to India, where he studied Sanskrit and edited in Allahabad The Indian Herald. Returning to America in February 1881, he continued to study Sanskrit at Harvard University for a year and for two years contributed to various periodicals, mainly The Critic. Early in 1882, he established his lifelong close friendship with Isabella Stewart Gardner.During this period he lived most of the time in Boston at his aunt Julia Ward Howe's house and in the company of his uncle, Sam Ward. His family was concerned about his financial prospects. His mother had hoped he could train in Boston for a career as an operatic baritone based on his private renditions of Schubert lieder. In January 1882, George Henschel, conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, assess his prospects and determined Crawford would never be able to sing in perfect tune . His uncle Sam Ward suggested he try writing about his years in India and helped him develop contacts with New York publishers.  Career  In December 1882, he produced his first novel, Mr Isaacs, a sketch of modern Anglo Indian life mingled with a touch of Oriental mystery. It had an immediate success, and Dr Claudius followed promptly. In May 1883, he returned to Italy, where he made his permanent home. He lived at the historic Hotel Cocumella in Sorrento during 1885 and settled permanently in Sant'Agnello, where in the fall he bought the Villa Renzi that became Villa Crawford. More than half his novels are set in Italy. He wrote three long historical studies of Italy and was well advanced with a history of Rome in the Middle Ages when he died. This may explain why Marion Crawford's books stand apart from any distinctively American current in literature.Year by year Crawford published a number of successful novels. However his 1896 novel Adam Johnstone's Son was thought by the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing to be rubbish . Late in the 1890s, Crawford began to write his historical works. These are: Ave Roma Immortalis , Rulers of the South renamed Southern Italy and Sicily and The Rulers of the South in 1905 for the American market, and Gleanings from Venetian History with the American title Salvae Venetia, reissued in 1909 as Venice; the Place and the People. In these, his intimate knowledge of local Italian history combines with the romanticist's imaginative faculty to excellent effect. His shorter book Constantinople belongs to this category. After most of his fictional works had been published, most came to think he was a gifted narrator; and his books of fiction, full of historic vitality and dramatic characterization, became widely popular among readers to whom the realism of problems or the eccentricities of subjective analysis were repellent. In The Novel: What It Is , he defended his literary approach, self conceived as a combination of romanticism and realism, defining the art form in terms of its marketplace and audience. The novel, he wrote, is a marketable commodity and intellectual artistic luxury that must amuse, indeed, but should amuse reasonably, from an intellectual point of view. . . . Its intention is to amuse and please, and certainly not to teach and preach; but in order to amuse well it must be a finely balanced creation. . . . . The Saracinesca series is perhaps known to be his best work, with the third in the series, Don Orsino set against the background of a real estate bubble, told with effective concision. The second volume is Sant' Ilario Hilary . A fourth book in the series, Corleone , was the first major treatment of the Mafia in literature, and used the now familiar but then original device of a priest unable to testify to a crime because of the Seal of the Confessional; the novel is not one of his major works, having failed to live up to the standard set by the books earlier in the series. Crawford ended Rulers of the South with a chapter about the Sicilian Mafia. Crawford himself was fondest of Khaled: A Tale of Arabia , a story of a genie who becomes human, which was reprinted in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series of the early 1970s. A Cigarette Maker's Romance was dramatized, and had considerable popularity on the stage as well as in its novel form; and in 1902 an original play from his pen, Francesca da Rimini, was produced in Paris by his friend Sarah Bernhardt. Crawford's best known dramatization was that of The White Sister . Its main actress was Viola Allen, whose first film was the 1915 film of this novel; it was filmed again in 1923 and 1933. In the Palace of the King was filmed in 1915 and 1923; Mr. Isaacs was filmed in 1931 as Son of India. Several of his short stories, such as The Upper Berth , For the Blood Is the Life , The Dead Smile , and The Screaming Skull , are often anthologized classics of the horror genre. An essay on Crawford's weird tales can be found in S. T. Joshi's The Evolution of the Weird Tale ; there are many other essays and introductions. The collected weird stories were posthumously published in 1911 as Wandering Ghosts in the U.S. and as Uncanny Tales in the UK, both without the long forgotten The King's Messenger . The present definitive edition is that edited by Richard Dalby as Uncanny Tales and published by the Tartarus Press . Crawford's novella Man Overboard! is often overlooked, but belongs with his supernatural works. In 1901, the American Macmillan firm began a deluxe uniform edition of his novels, as reprintings required. In 1904 the P. F. Collier Co. was authorized to publish a 25 volume edition, later increased to 32 volumes. Around 1914 the subscription firm McKinlay, Stone, Mackenzie was authorized to publish an edition using the Macmillan binding decorations. In 1919 the American Macmillan firm published the Sorrento Edition . They also had issued some first American editions and reprints in a uniform binding from 1891 through 1899. The British Macmillan firm used two separate uniform bindings from 1889 until after 1910. Crawford wrote numerous articles for major periodicals and a few contributions to books. See the section Bibliographical History in An F. Marion Crawford Companion by John C. Moran.  Personal life In 1880, Crawford converted to Roman Catholicism. In October 1884 he married Elizabeth Berdan, the daughter of the American Civil War Union General Hiram Berdan. They had two sons and two daughters, Eleanor, Harold, Clara and Bertram.Crawford died at Sorrento on Good Friday 1909 at Villa Crawford of a heart attack. It was the result of a severe lung injury ten years previous, caused by inhalation of toxic gases at a glass smelting works in Colorado, which happened during his American lecture tour in the winter of 1897 1898. He was gathering technical information for his historical novel Marietta , that describes glass making in late medieval Venice. After his death, his widow sued for breach of contract related to the production of Crawford's novels into a film.  Legacy and influence  In his 1929 article Some Remarks on Ghost Stories M. R. James praised Crawford's supernatural fiction. James stated that Marion Crawford and his horrid story of 'The Upper Berth', which is the best in his collection of Uncanny Tales, and stands high among ghost stories in general. H. Russell Wakefield, in an essay on ghost stories, called Crawford's The Upper Berth the very best one of such stories. Norman Douglas credits Crawford's financial success as instrumental in encouraging himself to write .The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society was founded in 1975 and published the literary review The Romantist from 1977 until 1997. In 1997 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford was founded at Sant'Agnello di Sorrento. It is formally associated with the FMC Memorial Society and continues The Romantist in its annual review Genius Loci . In early May 1988 at Sant'Agnello, a Conference was held to commemorate Crawford. It was organized by the Comune di Sant' Agnello di Sorrento and the Istituto Universitario Orientale . Its Acta were published in English and Italian as Il Magnifico Crawford. Scrittore per Mestiere The Magnificent Crawford. Writer by Trade , edited by Gordon Poole. In mid May 2009 the Centro Studi e Ricerche Francis Marion Crawford and the Comune di Sant' Agnello organized another Conference Francis Marion Crawford; 100 Anni Dopo to remember Crawford on the centenary of his death. Its Acta were published in Italian and English as Nuova Luce Su Francis Marion Crawford. Cento Anni Dopo 2009 1909 A Hundred Years Later: New Light on Francis Marion Crawford early in 2011, edited by Gordon Poole. The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society collaborated in the organization of both Conferences. There is a major street in the Italian town of Sant'Agnello di Sorrento named after him, the Corso Marion Crawford. There is a historical marker on the house where Crawford was born, in Bagni di Lucca. Villa Crawford was donated many years ago by Crawford's daughters Lady Eleanor Rocca Crawford and Mother Clare Marion Crawford to the Salesian Sisters, who operate it today as a high school for girls.In San Nicola Arcella, in the province of Cosenza, the Saracen tower where Francis Marion Crawford stayed in the summer is remembered as Torre Crawford. In 2020, the writer Andrea Carlo Cappi with Matteo Fazzolari and Cosimo Gentile, created the literary prize for short story Torre Crawford , whose annual theme is taken from a short story by Francis Marion Crawford .

            "text": "Frank Julian Sprague was an American naval officer and inventor who contributed to the development of the electric motor, electric railways, and electric elevators. His contributions were especially important in promoting urban development by increasing the size cities could reasonably attain and by allowing greater concentration of business in commercial sections . He became known as the Father of Electric Traction . Demonstrating an aptitude for science and mathematics, Sprague secured an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1874 and, after graduation in 1878 and 2 years at sea, he pursued his electrical studies relentlessly.  Early life and education Sprague was born in Milford, Connecticut, in 1857 to David Cummings Sprague and Frances Julia King Sprague, a school teacher: 79 His mother died when he was ten, and was sent by his father to live with an aunt in New York. He attended Drury High School in North Adams, Massachusetts, and excelled in mathematics. After graduating high school, Sprague went to Springfield, Massachusetts, to take an entrance exam for West Point, but somehow unexpectedly was taking the four day entrance exam for the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He got the highest score , and to go to the school he needed to borrow money. A local contractor and a bank loaned him four thousand dollars, and he travelled to Maryland. There, he graduated seventh in the class of 1878.  Career   United States Navy, inventor  He was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. During his ensuing naval service, he first served on the USS Richmond, then the USS Minnesota.: 95 While in Asia, Sprague wrote stories he filed for the Boston Herald. While his ship was in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1881, Sprague invented the inverted type of dynamo. After he was transferred to the USS Lancaster, the flagship of the European Squadron, he installed the first electric call bell system on a United States Navy ship. Sprague took leave to attend the International Exposition of Electricity of 1881 in Paris and the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Sydenham, England in 1882, where he was on the jury of awards for gas engines, dynamos and lamps.  Engineer for Edison  In 1883, Edward H. Johnson, a business associate of Thomas Edison, persuaded Sprague to resign his naval commission to work for Edison.: 81 Sprague, who began at a salary of 2,500, was neither happy with his salary nor his assignments. Sprague wanted to focus on motors, while motors bored Edison, who was consumed in making his incandescent lighting work. Edison sent Sprague to run the construction departments where Edison had built central power stations for his lighting systems in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and Brockton, Massachusetts.: 85 Sprague did important work for Edison, including correcting Edison's system of mains and feeders for central station distribution. In 1884, he decided his interests in the exploitation of electricity lay elsewhere, and he left Edison to found the Sprague Electric Railway Motor Company.: 96  Electrical pioneer  By 1886, Sprague's company had introduced two important inventions: a constant speed, non sparking motor with fixed brushes, and regenerative braking,: 96 a method of braking that uses the drive motor to return power to the main supply system. His motor was the first to maintain constant speed under varying load. It was immediately popular and was endorsed by Edison as the only practical electric motor available. His regenerative braking system was important in the development of the electric train and the electric elevator.  Electric streetcars  Sprague's inventions included several improvements to designs for systems of electric streetcars collecting electricity from overhead lines. He improved designs for a spring loaded trolley pole that had been developed in 1885 by Charles Van Depoele, devised a greatly improved mounting for streetcar motors and better gear designs, and proved that regenerative braking was practical. After testing his trolley system in late 1887 and early 1888, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, which began passenger operation on February 2, 1888. Long a transportation obstacle, the hills of Richmond included grades of over 10 , and were an excellent proving ground for acceptance of his new technology in other cities, in contrast to the cable cars which climbed the steepest grades of Nob Hill in San Francisco at the time. By the summer of 1888, Henry M. Whitney of the West End Street Railway in Boston had witnessed the simultaneous startup of multiple streetcars on a single power source and had signed up for conversion.: 10 By January 1889, Boston had its first electric streetcars which would be the first in the Americas to go underground some eight years later and which had become so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse about the new trolley pole technology, and the sparking contact shoe at its apex:: 10 Since then on many a car you'll see A broomstick as plain as plain can be; On every stick there's a witch astride The string you see to her leg is tied. Within a year, electric power had started to replace more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents. In 1890, Edison, who manufactured most of Sprague's equipment, bought him out, and Sprague turned his attention to electric elevators. However, he continued to be interested in the use of electricity for urban transportation and proposed a major expansion of London's Underground in 1901.Sprague's system of electric supply was a great advantage in relation to the first bipolar U tube overhead lines, in everyday use since 1883 on the M dling and Hinterbr hl Tram.  Electric elevators  While electrifying the streetcars of Richmond, the increased passenger capacity and speed gave Sprague the notion that similar results could be achieved in vertical transportation electric elevators. He saw that increasing the capacity of elevator shafts would not only save passengers' time but would also increase the earnings of tall buildings, with height limited by the total floor space taken up in the shaftways by slow hydraulic powered elevators. In 1892, Sprague founded the Sprague Electric Elevator Company. Working with Charles R. Pratt he developed the Sprague Pratt Electric Elevator, the first of which was installed in the Postal Telegraph Building in 1894. The company developed floor control, automatic elevators, acceleration control of car safeties, and a number of freight elevators. The Sprague Pratt elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 elevators had been installed worldwide. Sprague then sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895.  Multiple unit train controls  Sprague's experience with electric elevators lead him to devise a multiple unit system of electric railway operation, which accelerated the development of electric traction. In the multiple unit system, each car of the train carries electric traction motors. By means of relays energized by train line wires, the engineer commands all of the traction motors in the train to act together. For lighter trains there is no need for locomotives, so every car in the train can generate revenue. Where locomotives are used, one person can control all of them. Sprague's first multiple unit order was from the South Side Elevated Railroad in Chicago, Illinois. This success was quickly followed by substantial multiple unit contracts in Brooklyn, New York and Boston, Massachusetts.  New York: Grand Central, elevators in skyscrapers  From 1896 to 1900 Sprague served on the Commission for Terminal Electrification of the New York Central Railroad, including the Grand Central Terminal in New York City, where he designed a system of automatic train control to ensure compliance with trackside signals. He founded the Sprague Safety Control Signal Corporation to develop and build this system. Along with William J. Wilgus, he designed the Wilgus Sprague bottom contact third rail system used by the railroads leading into Grand Central Terminal.During World War I, Sprague served on the Naval Consulting Board. Then, in the 1920s, he devised a method for safely running two independent elevators, local and express, in a single shaft, to conserve floor space. He sold this system, along with systems for activating elevator car safety systems when acceleration or speed became too great, to the Westinghouse Company.  Legacy Sprague's developments in electric traction let cities grow larger, while his development of the elevator permitted greater concentration in their commercial sections and increased the profitability of commercial buildings. Sprague's inventions made modern light rail and rapid transit systems possible, which today still function on the same principles. The iconic Sprague Thomson rolling stock of the Paris M tro, in service from 1908 to 1983, are still referred to as les rames Sprague today. Sprague's engines were used as far afield as Sydney Harbour in Australia. A five horsepower Lundell electric motor used at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard between 1900 and 1980 is now in the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.  Awards and recognition Sprague was awarded the gold medal In Paris at the International Exposition of Electricity in 1889, the grand prize at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1904, and the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , for meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto in 1910.In addition, he received the Franklin Medal in 1921 and was posthumously awarded the John Fritz Gold Medal in 1935.  Personal life Sprague was twice married, first to a Mary Keatinge, and thereafter to Harriet Chapman Jones. Frank and Mary had one son, Frank Desmond. Frank and Harriet had two sons and a daughter: Robert C. Sprague , Julian K. and Frances A. Remembering his father, Robert wrote in 1935:All through his life and up to his last day, Frank Sprague had a prodigious capacity for work And once having made up his mind on a new invention or a new line of work, he was tireless and always striving for improvement. He had a brilliantly alert mind and was impatient of any half way compromise. His interest in his work never ceased; only a few hours before the end, he asked to have a newly designed model of his latest invention brought to his bedside. Sprague died on October 25, 1934. He was buried with full U.S. Navy honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. His wife Harriet was interred with him after her death in 1969. After Sprague's death, Harriet turned over a substantial amount of material from his collection to the New York Public Library, where it remains today accessible to the public via the rare books division. Other papers, including six volumes of congratulatory letters and photographs presented to Sprague on the occasion of his 75th birthday, is held at the Chapin Library, Williams College.In 1959, Harriet Sprague donated funds for the Sprague Building at the Shore Line Trolley Museum at East Haven, Connecticut, not far from Sprague's boyhood home in Milford. The museum is the oldest operating trolley museum in the United States and has one of the largest collections of trolley artifacts in the United States. Robert C. Sprague would go on to found and lead the Sprague Electric Company as its president and CEO . At its peak, Sprague Electric employed 12,000 people worldwide with plants in Scotland, France, Italy, and Japan, in addition to multiple locations in the United States, to become a leading manufacturer of capacitors and other electronic components. Sprague Electric was eventually acquired by General Cable in 1979 and then Vishay Intertechnology in 1992.Frank and Harriet's grandson Peter Sprague, an entrepreneur, would become CEO of National Semiconductor .  In remembrance and popular culture In 1999, grandsons, John L. Sprague and Peter Sprague cut the ribbon and started an 1884 Sprague motor at a new exhibit at the Shore Line Trolley Museum, where a permanent exhibit, Frank J. Sprague: Inventor, Scientist, Engineer , tells the story of the role of the Father of Electric Traction and the role of electricity in the growth of cities. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum adopted a stray cat, naming it after Sprague: Frank the Trolley Cat.In 2017, Sprague was the subject of a documentary episode, called The Race Underground, on season 29 of American Experience series that premiered on PBS television stations. It partly chronicled the beginnings of the Boston area MBTA's streetcar network, which described him as The Forgotten Hero of the American Subway .  References   Further reading Dalzell, Frederick .

            "text": "The Franklin Institute is a science museum and the center of science education and research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is named after the American scientist and statesman Benjamin Franklin. It houses the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Founded in 1824, the Franklin Institute is one of the oldest centers of science education and development in the United States. Its chief astronomer is Derrick Pitts.  History On February 5, 1824, Samuel Vaughan Merrick and William H. Keating founded the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts. With a view further to develop the resources of the union, increase the national independence, call forth the ingenuity and industry of the people, and thereby increase the comforts of the community at large. Begun in 1825, the institute was an important force in the professionalization of American science and technology through the nineteenth century, beginning with early investigations into steam engines and water power. In addition to conducting scientific inquiry, it fostered research and education by running schools, publishing the influential Journal of The Franklin Institute, sponsoring exhibitions, and recognizing scientific advancement and invention with medals and awards.In the late twentieth century, the institute's research roles gave way to educating the general public through its museum. The Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute, founded in 1924 to conduct research in the physical sciences, now is part of the University of Delaware and named Bartol Research Institute. The Franklin Institute Laboratories for Research and Development operated from the Second World War into the 1980s. Many scientists have demonstrated groundbreaking new technology at the Franklin Institute. From September 2 to October 11, 1884, it hosted the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, the first great electrical exposition in the United States. The world's first public demonstration of an all electronic television system was later given by Philo Taylor Farnsworth on August 25, 1934.The first female member, Elizabeth Skinner, was elected to membership in 1833. The Franklin Institute was integrated in 1870, when Philadelphia teacher and activist Octavius Catto was admitted as a member. The institute's original building at 15 South 7th Street, later the home of the Atwater Kent Museum, eventually proved too small for the institute's research, educational programs, and library. The Institute moved into its current home on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, near the intersection with 20th Street, in 1934. The new facility was intended from the start to educate visitors through hand on interactions with exhibits: Visitors to this museum would be encouraged to touch, handle, and operate the exhibits in order to learn how things work. Funds to build the new Institute and Franklin Memorial came from the Poor Richard Club, the City Board of Trust, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc., and the Franklin Institute. John T. Windrim's original design was a completely square building surrounding the Benjamin Franklin Statue, which had yet to be built. Despite the effects of the Great Depression, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc. raised 5 million between December 1929 and June 1930. Only two of the four wings envisioned by Windrim were built; these face the Parkway and share design elements with other cultural and civic structures around Logan Circle. On March 31, 1940, press agent William Castellini issued a press release stating that the world would end the next day. The story was picked up by KYW, which reported, Your worst fears that the world will end are confirmed by astronomers of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. Scientists predict that the world will end at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time tomorrow. This is no April Fool joke. Confirmation can be obtained from Wagner Schlesinger, director of the Fels Planetarium of this city. This caused a panic in the city which only subsided when the Franklin Institute assured people it had made no such prediction. Castellini was dismissed shortly thereafter.On December 21, 2017, during a party hosted by the museum, a partygoer with his companions slipped into a closed off exhibit of ten terracotta warriors on loan from China. After his companions left, the partygoer broke off and stole a thumb from one of the warriors. Law enforcement agents later recovered the stolen thumb. The vandalized cavalryman is valued at US 4.5 million, and is considered a priceless part of China's cultural heritage . The vandalism stoked outrage in Chinese media such as Xinhua. The Franklin Institute blamed its external security contractor, and stated it has reviewed its security measures and procedures to prevent such situations from recurring. The defendant was charged both with theft, and with concealment of an item of cultural heritage. The defense argued that the defendant was being overcharged under statutes applicable to professional art thieves. An April 2019 trial ended in a hung jury, with seven of the twelve jurors in favor of acquittal. A February 2020 retrial was postponed due to travel restrictions related to the COVID 19 pandemic.In 2021, the institute housed the work of Dyymond Whipper Young as she broke the Guinness world record for the world's largest drawing by an individual .

Avery Marsha R. Perelman James A. Unruh  Capital campaign  In 2006, the Franklin Institute began fundraising activities for the Inspire Science! capital campaign, a 64.7 million campaign intended to fund the construction of a 53,000 sq ft building addition, new exhibits, and upgrades and renovations to the existing Institute building and exhibits.In 2011, the Franklin Institute received a 10 million gift from Athena and Nicholas Karabots towards the Inspire Science! capital campaign. This gift is the largest gift in the institute's history, and put the Franklin Institute within 6 million of the 64.7 million capital campaign goal. The Nicholas and Athena Karabots Pavilion will house not only a 10 million multiroom exhibit on neuroscience, but also a conference center, classroom space, and additional room for traveling exhibitions.  The Science Center The most recognizable part of the Franklin Institute's Science Center is the Franklin Institute Science Museum. In the spirit of inquiry and discovery embodied by Benjamin Franklin, the mission of the Franklin Institute Science Museum serves to inspire an understanding of and passion for science and technology learning. Among other exhibits, the Science Museum holds the largest collection of artifacts from the Wright brothers' workshop.  Permanent exhibits  Electricity, which replaced Franklin...He's Electric in 2010, showcases Franklin's discovery of electricity and its use in the modern world, including elements such as a sustainable dance floor, and an array of LEDs that turn on in the presence of cell phone signals and other low power electrical signals. Changing Earth, which opened to the public, along with Electricity, on March 27, 2010, focuses on the powerful forces of air, water, and land and their effect upon the earth, as well as how humans respond to and interact with these forces. The Franklin Airshow features The Wright Brothers Aeronautical Engineering Collection, their newly restored Wright Model B airplane, and a United States Air Force 1948 T 33 Shooting Star jet trainer. The Giant Heart has been a Philadelphia icon since its opening in 1954. Joel N. Bloom Observatory, remodeled in 2006, features five telescopes, including a very large 10 inch Zeiss Refractor and four 8 inch Meade Reflectors. SportsZone is an interactive exhibit that shows the science behind sports. The Train Factory has a real, once movable train: The Baldwin 60000 steam locomotive, which was rolled into the museum while the building's walls were still being constructed.  Sir Isaac's Loft allows visitors to blend art and science into their own masterpiece. Space Command features real space suits and allows visitors to track their houses, in real time, via satellite. The Franklin Institute installed Foxtrot Papa, a former British Airways Boeing 707 airliner, as a permanent exhibit in the mid 1970s. Standing above an outdoor Science Park and connected to the second floor aviation hall by skybridges, this aircraft could easily be seen from the outside of the building and was a remarkable sight in the middle of a major city. In the 1980s, however, the aircraft was sold for scrap, much to the dismay of local aviation enthusiasts. Amazing Machine allows visitors to experience a machine like environment featuring little seen pieces from the Franklin Institute's priceless collection, including Maillardet's automaton. Your Brain explores the physiology and neurology of our most remarkable organ. The exhibit includes an 18 foot tall Luckey Climber climbing structure that simulates neural pathways sending messages, and an area to discuss questions of neuroscience ethics, in addition to 70 interactive learning experiences.  Other attractions  The Science Center includes many pertinent attractions that are not museum exhibits. The Budd BB 1 Pioneer flying boat, in front of the museum, was the world's first stainless steel airplane, built by the Edward F. Budd Manufacturing Corporation, and has been on display since 1935.A mock up which would eventually become the Lunar Module in the Apollo space program, first shown on display in the 1966 67 World's Fair, held in the New York Hall of Science, is also located on the grounds.   Theaters  In 1933, Samuel Simeon Fels contributed funds to build The Fels Planetarium, only the second built in the United States after Chicago's Adler Planetarium. Fully reconstructed in 2002, the Planetarium's new design includes replacement of the original 40,000 pound stainless steel dome, originally built in 1933. The new premium dome is lighter and is 60 feet in diameter. It is the first of its kind in the United States. The planetarium is also outfitted for visitors who are hearing impaired. The Tuttleman IMAX Theater is an IMAX dome theater that is 180 encompassing and tilted at 30 degrees. The seating places the audience up in the dome which is over 70 ft across and 4.5 stories tall. In addition, the theater has 20,000 watts of amplifier power and over 50 speakers. Early in 2008, extensive renovation of the museum's auditorium was completed. Previously a lecture hall, the space was renamed Franklin Theater, and features 3 D and hi def Blu ray digital projection capabilities. The Franklin Theater shows educational films during daytime hours while also including mass release feature length films.  Traveling exhibits  In the past, the Science Center has hosted many traveling exhibits including Storms, Titanic, Grossology, Body Worlds, Darwin, and Robots. In the summer of 2007, the Franklin Institute hosted Tutankhamun and The Golden Age of The Pharaohs, in the Mandell Center of the Franklin Institute Science Museum. The exhibit began its United States Tour in Los Angeles, and went to Fort Lauderdale, and Chicago, before coming to Philadelphia for its final American appearance. When the exhibit left Philadelphia on September 30, 2007, it traveled to London. This exhibit was nearly twice the size of the original Tutankhamun exhibit of the 1970s, and contained 50 objects directly from Tut's tomb, as well as nearly 70 object from the tombs of his ancestors in The Valley of the Kings. The show also featured a CAT Scan that revealed what the Boy King may have looked like. The Franklin Institute is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers and the American Alliance of Museums .The Franklin Institute is also a member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative with the Fort Worth Museum of Science History; the Museum of Science, Boston; COSI Columbus, formerly known as the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio; OMSI in Portland, Oregon; the Science Museum of Minnesota in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and the California Science Center, formerly the California Museum of Science Industry, in Los Angeles.  Benjamin Franklin National Memorial  The Benjamin Franklin National Memorial features a 20 foot high marble statue, sculpted by James Earle Fraser. Originally opened in 1938, the Memorial was designed by architect John T. Windrim and modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. The Hall is 82 ft in length, width, and height. The domed ceiling is self supporting and weighs 1600 tons. The floors, walls, columns, pilasters, and cornices are made of marbles imported from Portugal, Italy, and France. The United States Congress designated the Hall and statue as the official Benjamin Franklin National Memorial on October 25, 1972. The Memorial was dedicated by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in 1976. On December 30, 2005, Congress authorized the institute to receive up to 10 million in matching grants for the rehabilitation of the memorial and for the development of related exhibits.In the fall of 2008, the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial was re opened after a summer long restoration that included multimedia enhancements. Philadelphia's most famous citizen is featured in Benjamin Franklin Forever, an hourly 3.5 minute multimedia presentation utilizing the entire rotunda. Also noteworthy is the Franklin Institute's Frankliniana Collection, some of which is on rotating display in the Pendulum Staircase. Highlights include Franklin's 1777 Nini Medallion, the scale model of the bust from the statue in the Memorial, the figurehead of Franklin's bust from the USS Franklin, his ceremonial sword used in the court of King Louis XVI, and the odometer that Franklin used to measure the postal routes in Philadelphia. Additionally, the institute's Electricity exhibition highlights one of Franklin's lightning rods, his electricity tube, a Franklin Electrostatic Generator, the 1751 publication of Franklin's Experiments and Observations on Electricity, and Thornton Oakley's two 1940 historical murals of Franklin and the Kite and Key experiment.  The Journal of The Franklin Institute  In 1826, The Journal of The Franklin Institute was established to publish US Patent information and to document scientific and technological achievements throughout the nation. It is the second oldest continuously published scientific journal in the country, and is now primarily devoted to applied mathematics.  Awards  Since 1824, the Franklin Institute has maintained the longest continuously awarded science and technology awards program in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world. The first issue of the Journal of The Franklin Institute, dated January 1826, makes the first written reference to these awards. Before 1998 several medals were awarded by the Franklin Institute, such as : the Elliott Cresson Medal , the Edward Longstreth Medal , the Howard N. Potts Medal , the Franklin Medal , the George R. Henderson Medal , the Louis E. Levy Medal , the John Price Wetherill Medal , The Frank P. Brown Medal , Stuart Ballantine Medal , and the Albert A. Michelson Medal . Past winners include Henry Ford, Frank Lloyd Wright, Marie Curie, and Thomas Edison.In 1998 all of the endowed medals were reorganized as the Benjamin Franklin Medals. Multiple medals are given every year, for different fields of science and engineering. The fields awarded today are Chemistry , Computer and Cognitive Science , Earth and Environmental Science , Electrical Engineering , Life Science , Mechanical Engineering and Physics . In the past also the fields Earth Science , Engineering and Materials Science were rewarded.Additionally since 1990, the Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science and the Bower Award for Business Leadership have been awarded annually. They are funded by a 7.5 million bequest in 1988 from Henry Bower, a chemical manufacturer in Philadelphia. The Bower Science Award contains 250,000 of cash, one of the largest amounts for a science award in the US.The institute's Committee on Science and the Arts determines the winners of these awards. Recipients and related information can be found in the laureates database.  Informal science learning research The Franklin Institute also undertakes research in informal science education. Areas of special strength are educational technology, school partnerships, and youth leadership. In addition, the center has built a substantial portfolio of unique online resources of the history of science, including online exhibits on Ben Franklin and the Heart, as well as resources on the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection. The Franklin Institute is a member of the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network .  Programs   Science Leadership Academy  Opening in September 2006, The Science Leadership Academy is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia.  Teacher professional development  The Franklin Institute offers summer institutes and school year mini courses for K 8 teachers, in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia and Curriculum Instruction Office.  Partnerships for Achieving Careers in Technology and Science  Partnerships for Achieving Careers in Technology and Science, or PACTS, is a year round program of science enrichment, career development, and leadership opportunities for diverse middle and high school students in the Philadelphia Region. PACTS students use hands on science workshops, field based research, field trips, and laboratory experiments to learn how science affects their everyday lives.  Girls at the Center  Girls at the Center is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA provided girls and their families a chance to learn about science together. Over 100 sites participated in the program, with over 70 of the sites still active today. Girls at the Center provided activities for the girls to do with their families at home, as well as projects to be completed on site, all culminating in a year end party.

Free space means air, outer space, vacuum, or something similar. This contrasts with using solids such as optical fiber cable. The technology is useful where the physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations.  History  Optical communications, in various forms, have been used for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks used a coded alphabetic system of signalling with torches developed by Cleoxenus, Democleitus and Polybius. In the modern era, semaphores and wireless solar telegraphs called heliographs were developed, using coded signals to communicate with their recipients. In 1880, Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter created the photophone, at Bell's newly established Volta Laboratory in Washington, DC. Bell considered it his most important invention. The device allowed for the transmission of sound on a beam of light. On June 3, 1880, Bell conducted the world's first wireless telephone transmission between two buildings, some 213 meters apart.Its first practical use came in military communication systems many decades later, first for optical telegraphy. German colonial troops used heliograph telegraphy transmitters during the Herero and Namaqua genocide starting in 1904, in German South West Africa as did British, French, US or Ottoman signals. During the trench warfare of World War I when wire communications were often cut, German signals used three types of optical Morse transmitters called Blinkger t, the intermediate type for distances of up to 4 km at daylight and of up to 8 km at night, using red filters for undetected communications. Optical telephone communications were tested at the end of the war, but not introduced at troop level. In addition, special blinkger ts were used for communication with airplanes, balloons, and tanks, with varying success.A major technological step was to replace the Morse code by modulating optical waves in speech transmission. Carl Zeiss, Jena developed the Lichtsprechger t 80 80 that the German army used in their World War II anti aircraft defense units, or in bunkers at the Atlantic Wall.The invention of lasers in the 1960s revolutionized free space optics. Military organizations were particularly interested and boosted their development. However, the technology lost market momentum when the installation of optical fiber networks for civilian uses was at its peak. Many simple and inexpensive consumer remote controls use low speed communication using infrared light. This is known as consumer IR technologies.  Usage and technologies Free space point to point optical links can be implemented using infrared laser light, although low data rate communication over short distances is possible using LEDs. Infrared Data Association technology is a very simple form of free space optical communications. On the communications side the FSO technology is considered as a part of the optical wireless communications applications. Free space optics can be used for communications between spacecraft.  Useful distances  The reliability of FSO units has always been a problem for commercial telecommunications. Consistently, studies find too many dropped packets and signal errors over small ranges . This is from both independent studies, such as in the Czech Republic, as well as formal internal nationwide studies, such as one conducted by MRV FSO staff. Military based studies consistently produce longer estimates for reliability, projecting the maximum range for terrestrial links is of the order of 2 to 3 km . All studies agree the stability and quality of the link is highly dependent on atmospheric factors such as rain, fog, dust and heat. Relays may be employed to extend the range for FSO communications.  Extending the useful distance  The main reason terrestrial communications have been limited to non commercial telecommunications functions is fog. Fog consistently keeps FSO laser links over 500 metres from achieving a year round bit error rate of 1 per 100,000. Several entities are continually attempting to overcome these key disadvantages to FSO communications and field a system with a better quality of service. DARPA has sponsored over US 130 million in research toward this effort, with the ORCA and ORCLE programs.Other non government groups are fielding tests to evaluate different technologies that some claim have the ability to address key FSO adoption challenges. As of October 2014, none have fielded a working system that addresses the most common atmospheric events. FSO research from 1998 2006 in the private sector totaled 407.1 million, divided primarily among four start up companies. All four failed to deliver products that would meet telecommunications quality and distance standards: Terabeam received approximately 575 million in funding from investors such as Softbank, Mobius Venture Capital and Oakhill Venture Partners. AT T and Lucent backed this attempt. The work ultimately failed, and the company was purchased in 2004 for 52 million by Falls Church, Va. based YDI, effective June 22, 2004, and used the name Terabeam for the new entity. On September 4, 2007, Terabeam announced it would change its name to Proxim Wireless Corporation, and change its NASDAQ stock symbol from TRBM to PRXM. AirFiber received 96.1 million in funding, and never solved the weather issue. They sold out to MRV communications in 2003, and MRV sold their FSO units until 2012 when the end of life was abruptly announced for the Terescope series. LightPointe Communications received 76 million in start up funds, and eventually reorganized to sell hybrid FSO RF units to overcome the weather based challenges. The Maxima Corporation published its operating theory in Science, and received 9 million in funding before permanently shutting down. No known spin off or purchase followed this effort. Wireless Excellence developed and launched CableFree UNITY solutions that combine FSO with millimeter wave and radio technologies to extend distance, capacity and availability, with a goal of making FSO a more useful and practical technology.One private company published a paper on November 20, 2014, claiming they had achieved commercial reliability in extreme fog. There is no indication this product is currently commercially available.  Extraterrestrial  The massive advantages of laser communication in space have multiple space agencies racing to develop a stable space communication platform, with many significant demonstrations and achievements.  Operational systems  The first gigabit laser based communication was achieved by the European Space Agency and called the European Data Relay System on November 28, 2014. The system is operational and is being used on a daily basis.  Demonstrations  NASA's OPALS announced a breakthrough in space to ground communication December 9, 2014, uploading 175 megabytes in 3.5 seconds. Their system is also able to re acquire tracking after the signal was lost due to cloud cover. In the early morning hours of Oct. 18, 2013, NASA's Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration made history, transmitting data from lunar orbit to Earth at a rate of 622 megabits per second . LLCD was flown aboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer satellite , whose primary science mission was to investigate the tenuous and exotic atmosphere that exists around the moon. In January 2013, NASA used lasers to beam an image of the Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter roughly 390,000 km away. To compensate for atmospheric interference, an error correction code algorithm similar to that used in CDs was implemented.A two way distance record for communication was set by the Mercury laser altimeter instrument aboard the MESSENGER spacecraft, and was able to communicate across a distance of 24 million km , as the craft neared Earth on a fly by in May, 2005. The previous record had been set with a one way detection of laser light from Earth, by the Galileo probe, of 6 million km in 1992. Quote from Laser Communication in Space Demonstrations   Commercial use  Various satellite constellations such as SpaceX Starlink are intended to provide global broadband coverage employ laser communication for inter satellite links between the several hundred to thousand satellites effectively creating a space based optical mesh network.  LEDs  In 2001, Twibright Labs released RONJA Metropolis, an open source DIY 10 Mbit s full duplex LED FSO over 1.4 km .In 2004, a Visible Light Communication Consortium was formed in Japan. This was based on work from researchers that used a white LED based space lighting system for indoor local area network communications. These systems present advantages over traditional UHF RF based systems from improved isolation between systems, the size and cost of receivers transmitters, RF licensing laws and by combining space lighting and communication into the same system. In January 2009, a task force for visible light communication was formed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers working group for wireless personal area network standards known as IEEE 802.15.7. A trial was announced in 2010, in St. Cloud, Minnesota.Amateur radio operators have achieved significantly farther distances using incoherent sources of light from high intensity LEDs. One reported 173 miles in 2007. However, physical limitations of the equipment used limited bandwidths to about 4 kHz. The high sensitivities required of the detector to cover such distances made the internal capacitance of the photodiode used a dominant factor in the high impedance amplifier which followed it, thus naturally forming a low pass filter with a cut off frequency in the 4 kHz range. Lasers can reach very high data rates which are comparable to fiber communications. Projected data rates and future data rate claims vary. A low cost white LED which could be used for space lighting can typically be modulated up to 20 MHz. Data rates of over 100 Mbit s can be easily achieved using efficient modulation schemes and Siemens claimed to have achieved over 500 Mbit s in 2010. Research published in 2009, used a similar system for traffic control of automated vehicles with LED traffic lights.In September 2013, pureLiFi, the Edinburgh start up working on Li Fi, also demonstrated high speed point to point connectivity using any off the shelf LED light bulb. In previous work, high bandwidth specialist LEDs have been used to achieve the high data rates. The new system, the Li 1st, maximizes the available optical bandwidth for any LED device, thereby reducing the cost and improving the performance of deploying indoor FSO systems.  Engineering details Typically, the best scenarios for using this technology are: LAN to LAN connections on campuses at Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet speeds LAN to LAN connections in a city, a metropolitan area network To cross a public road or other barriers which the sender and receiver do not own Speedy service delivery of high bandwidth access to optical fiber networks Converged voice data connection Temporary network installation Reestablish high speed connection quickly As an alternative or upgrade add on to existing wireless technologies Especially powerful in combination with auto aiming systems, to power moving cars or a laptop while moving. or to use auto aiming nodes to create a network with other nodes. As a safety add on for important fiber connections For communications between spacecraft, including elements of a satellite constellation For inter and intra chip communicationThe light beam can be very narrow, which makes FSO hard to intercept, improving security. It is comparatively easy to encrypt any data traveling across the FSO connection for additional security. FSO provides vastly improved electromagnetic interference behavior compared to using microwaves.  Technical advantages  Ease of deployment Can be used to power devices License free long range operation High bit rates Low bit error rates Immunity to electromagnetic interference Full duplex operation Protocol transparency Increased security when working with narrow beam No Fresnel zone necessary Reference open source implementation  Range limiting factors  For terrestrial applications, the principal limiting factors are: Fog Beam dispersion Atmospheric absorption Rain Snow Terrestrial scintillation Interference from background light sources Shadowing Pointing stability in wind Pollution, such as smogThese factors cause an attenuated receiver signal and lead to higher bit error ratio . To overcome these issues, vendors found some solutions, like multi beam or multi path architectures, which use more than one sender and more than one receiver. Some state of the art devices also have larger fade margin . To keep an eye safe environment, good FSO systems have a limited laser power density and support laser classes 1 or 1M. Atmospheric and fog attenuation, which are exponential in nature, limit practical range of FSO devices to several kilometres. However, free space optics based on 1550 nm wavelength, have considerably lower optical loss than free space optics using 830 nm wavelength, in dense fog conditions. FSO using wavelength 1550 nm system are capable of transmitting several times higher power than systems with 850 nm and are safe to the human eye . Additionally, some free space optics, such as EC SYSTEM, ensure higher connection reliability in bad weather conditions by constantly monitoring link quality to regulate laser diode transmission power with built in automatic gain control.

The milligal and microgal are respectively one thousandth and one millionth of a gal. The gal is not part of the International System of Units . In 1978 the CIPM decided that it was permissible to use the gal with the SI until the CIPM considers that its use is no longer necessary . However, use of the gal is deprecated by ISO 80000 3:2006. The gal is a derived unit, defined in terms of the centimeter gram second base unit of length, the centimeter, and the second, which is the base unit of time in both the CGS and the modern SI system. In SI base units, 1 Gal is equal to 0.01 m s2. The acceleration due to Earth's gravity at its surface is 976 to 983 Gal, the variation being due mainly to differences in latitude and elevation. Mountains and masses of lesser density within the Earth's crust typically cause variations in gravitational acceleration of tens to hundreds of milligals . The gravity gradient above Earth's surface is about 3.1 Gal per centimeter of height , resulting in a maximal difference of about 2 Gal from the top of Mount Everest to sea level.Unless it is being used at the beginning of a sentence or in paragraph or section titles, the unit name gal is properly spelled with a lowercase g. As with the torr and its symbol, the unit name and its symbol are spelled identically except that the latter is capitalized.

            "text": "Galileo Ferraris was an Italian university professor, physicist and electrical engineer, one of the pioneers of AC power system and inventor of the induction motor although he never patented his work. Many newspapers touted that his work on the induction motor and power transmission systems were some of the greatest inventions of all ages. He published an extensive and complete monograph on the experimental results obtained with open circuit transformers of the type designed by the power engineers Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs.  Biography  Born at Livorno Vercellese , Ferraris gained a master's degree in engineering and became an assistant of technical physics near the Regal Italian Industrial Museum. Ferraris independently researched the rotary magnetic field in 1885. Ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors. The research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator, which may be thought of as an alternating current motor operating in reverse, so as to convert mechanical power into electric power . On 11 March 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin . These alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts, and depended on rotating magnetic field for their operation. The resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance. The invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification, as is the power transformer. These inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances. Polyphase power enabled the use of water power in remote places, thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity, which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done. This versatility sparked the growth of power transmission network grids on continents around the globe. In 1889, Ferraris worked at the Italian Industrial Institution, a school of electrical engineering . In 1896, Ferraris joined the Italian Electrotechnical Association and became the first national president of the organization. Galileo Ferraris did not confine his research interests to electricity. He also researched the fundamental properties of dioptric instruments and made elementary representation of the theory and its applications. His work contains a detailed description of the geometric dioptrics for uncentered systems. He provided a greater generality as previously found in the telescopic system treatments, with less emphasis on applications. In the second main sections, the results obtained are applied to optical instruments. The magnification, field of view, and the brightness of the instrument were dealt with in great detail. The field denned as the author of the cone opening angle, the tip of the first main points of the lens, and its base formed by the parts of the object in view, will possess the same brightness. The eye is not treated.  Memorials The city of Turin honored the contributions that Ferraris made to science. A general committee proposed an addition to the Royal Industrial Museum of Turin with a permanent monument commemorating his scientific and industrial achievements. Additionally, an avenue was named in honor of Ferraris. In January 2021 Ferraris was honored by the IEEE Milestones program for his contribution to the technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity , namely for his Rotating Fields and Early Induction Motors, 1885 1888 1 . The according plaque carries the inscription:Galileo Ferraris, professor at the Italian Industrial Museum of Turin, conceived and demonstrated the principle of the rotating magnetic field. Ferraris field, produced by two stationary coils with perpendicular axes, was driven by alternating currents phase shifted by 90 degrees. Ferraris also constructed prototypes of two phase AC motors. Rotating fields, polyphase currents, and their application to induction motors had a fundamental role in the electrification of the world.  Publications Le propriet cardinali degli strumenti ottici.

Early life Hubbard was born, raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts to Samuel Hubbard , a Massachusetts Supreme Court justice, and Mary Ann Greene . His younger brother was Charles Eustis Hubbard , who later became the first secretary and clerk of the Bell Telephone Company.Hubbard was a grandson of Boston merchant Gardiner Greene. He was also a descendant of Lion Gardiner, an early English settler and soldier in the New World who founded the first English settlement in what later became the State of New York, and whose legacy includes Gardiners Island which remains in the family.He attended Phillips Academy, Andover, and graduated from Dartmouth in 1841. He then studied law at Harvard, and was admitted to the bar in 1843.  Career He first settled in Cambridge and joined the Boston law firm of Benjamin Robbins Curtis. There he became active in local institutions. Hubbard helped establish a city water works in Cambridge, was a founder of the Cambridge Gas Co. and later organized a Cambridge to Boston trolley system. Hubbard also played a pivotal role in the founding of Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was the first oral school for the deaf in the United States, and Hubbard remained a trustee for the rest of his life. Hubbard entered the national stage by becoming a proponent for the nationalization of the telegraph system under the U.S. Postal Service stating in an article: The Proposed Changes in the Telegraphic System , It is not contended that the postal system is free from defects, but that it removes many of the grave evils of the present system, without the introduction of new ones; and that the balance of benefits greatly preponderates in favor of the cheap rates, increased facilities, limited and divided powers of the postal system. During the late 1860s, Hubbard lobbied Congress to pass the U.S. Postal Telegraph Bill known as the Hubbard Bill. The bill would have chartered the U.S. Postal Telegraph Company that would be connected to the U.S. Post Office, but the bill did not pass. To benefit from the Hubbard Bill, Hubbard needed patents which dominated essential aspects of telegraph technology such as sending multiple messages simultaneously on a single telegraph wire. This was called the harmonic telegraph or acoustic telegraphy. To acquire such patents, Hubbard and his partner Thomas Sanders financed Alexander Graham Bell's experiments and development of an acoustic telegraph, which led to his invention of the telephone. Following Curtis's retirement, Hubbard relocated to Washington, D.C. where he continued to practice law for 5 more years. In 1876, he was appointed by President Grant to determine the proper rates for railway mail and he served as a commissioner to the Centennial Exposition.  Bell Telephone Company  Hubbard organized the Bell Telephone Company on July 9, 1877, with himself as president, Thomas Sanders as treasurer and Bell as 'Chief Electrician'. Two days later, he became the father in law of Bell when his daughter, Mabel Hubbard, married Bell on July 11, 1877. Gardiner Hubbard was intimately connected with the Bell Telephone Company, which subsequently evolved into the National Bell Telephone Company and then the American Bell Telephone Company, merging with smaller telephone companies during its growth. The American Bell Telephone Company would, at the very end of 1899, evolve into AT T, at times the world's largest telephone company. Hubbard has been credited as the entrepreneur who distributed the telephone to the world.  Edison Speaking Phonograph Company  Hubbard also became a principal investor in the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company. When Edison neglected development of the phonograph, which at its inception was barely functional, Hubbard helped his son in law, Alexander Graham Bell, organize a competing company in 1881 that developed wax coated cardboard cylinders and disks for used on a graphophone. These improvements were invented by Alexander Bell's cousin Chester Bell, a chemist, and Charles Sumner Tainter, an optical instrument maker, at Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Hubbard and Chester Bell approached Edison about combining their interests, but Edison refused, resulting in the Volta Laboratory Association merging the shares of their Volta Graphophone Company with the company that later evolved into Columbia Records in 1886.  Other projects  Hubbard was also interested in the public side of science. After his move to Washington, he was one of the founders and the first president of the National Geographic Society, serving in that capacity from 1888 1897. Today, the Hubbard Medal is given for distinction in exploration, discovery, and research. In 1897, he also helped to rescue the A.A.A.S, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which was founded in 1848, from financial peril and extinction by enabling its purchase of the Science magazine, which he also founded, in 1883.He served as a trustee of Columbian University from 1883 until his death. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. He created a large collection of etchings and engravings, which were given by his widow to the Library of Congress with a fund for additions. In 1894, Hubbard was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society  Personal life  In 1846, Hubbard married Gertrude Mercer McCurdy , the daughter of Robert Henry McCurdy, a prominent New York City businessman, and Gertrude Mercer Lee, who was the niece of Theodore Frelinghuysen, a United States Senator and former vice presidential candidate. Her brother, Richard Aldrich McCurdy, served as president of Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Together, they had six children: Robert Hubbard , who died young. Gertrude McCurdy Hubbard , who married Maurice Neville Grossmann Mabel Gardiner Hubbard , who married Alexander Graham Bell, the son of Alexander Melville Bell, in 1877. Roberta Wolcott Hubbard , who married Charles James Bell , son of David Charles Bell and a cousin of Alexander Graham Bell, in 1881. Grace Hubbard , who married her sister Roberta's husband, Charles, in 1887 after Roberta's death during childbirth in 1885. Marian Hubbard , who also died young.Gardiner Hubbard's daughter Mabel became deaf at the age of five from scarlet fever. She later became a student of Alexander Graham Bell, who taught deaf children, and they eventually married.Hubbard's house on Brattle Street in Cambridge no longer stands. But a large beech tree from its garden still remains. To service his then modern Cambridge house, Hubbard wanted gas lights, the then new form of illumination. So he founded the Cambridge Gas Company, now part of NSTAR. After he moved to Washington, D.C. from Cambridge in 1873, Hubbard subdivided his large Cambridge estate. On Hubbard Park Road and Mercer Circle , he built large houses designed for Harvard faculty. On nearby Foster Street, he built smaller houses, still with modern amenities, for the better class of mechanic. This neighborhood west of Harvard Square in Cambridge is now both popular and expensive.He died on December 11, 1897 at Twin Oaks, his suburban residence. His funeral was held at the Church of the Covenant in Washington, where he was president of the board of trustees. His widow died during a car accident on October 20, 1909 in Washington, D.C.  Descendants  Through his daughter Gertrude, he was the grandfather of Gertrude Hubbard Grossmann , who married Peter Stuyvesant Pillot , at Hubbard's home, Twin Oaks, in 1903. Their daughter, Rosalie Pillot was married to Lewis Rutherfurd Stuyvesant , the son of Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, in 1925. After giving birth to a son, they divorced in 1935.Through his daughter Mabel, he was the grandfather of Elsie May Bell , who married Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor of National Geographic fame, Marian Hubbard Daisy Bell , who was married to David Fairchild. and two boys who died in infancy . Through his daughter Roberta, he was the grandfather of Grace Hubbard Bell , who was married to Granville Roland Fortescue , an American soldier and Rough Rider who was the cousin of Theodore Roosevelt and son of Robert Roosevelt . Grace was the mother of three girls, Marion Fortescue, who married Daulton Gillespie Viskniskki in 1934, Thalia Fortescue Massie , and Kenyon Fortescue Reynolds , better known as actress Helene Whitney.  Legacy  Gardiner Hubbard's life is detailed in the book One Thousand Years of Hubbard History, by Edward Warren Day. He was portrayed by a suitably bewhiskered Charles Coburn in the popular biopic The Story of Alexander Graham Bell . In 1890, Mount Hubbard on the Alaska Yukon border was named in his honor by an expedition co sponsored by the National Geographic Society while he was president. The Hubbard Glacier was named after him by Robert Peary. The main school building at the Clarke School for the Deaf, Hubbard Hall, is named after him in his honor. In 1899, a new school on Kenyon Street in Washington, DC was named the Hubbard School in his honor as one of the most public spirited men of the District, never neglecting an opportunity to advance its interests, but was also a man of great learning and earnestly interested in all educational movements. Mr. Hubbard was the president of the National Geographic Society, a man prominent in science and a man of the highest character. The school has since been closed and demolished.

            "text": "The gauss, symbol G , is a unit of measurement of magnetic induction, also known as magnetic flux density. The unit is part of the Gaussian system of units, which inherited it from the older CGS EMU system. It was named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1936. One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimetre. As the cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units , the use of the gauss has been deprecated by the standards bodies, but is still regularly used in various subfields of science. The SI unit for magnetic flux density is the tesla , which corresponds to 10,000gauss.  Name, symbol, and metric prefixes Albeit not a component of the International System of Units, the usage of the gauss generally follows the rules for SI units. Since the name is derived from a person's name, its symbol is the uppercase letter G. When the unit is spelled out, it is written in lowercase , unless it begins a sentence.: 147 148 The gauss may be combined with metric prefixes,: 128 such as in milligauss, mG , or kilogauss, kGauss or kG.  Unit conversions  The gauss is the unit of magnetic flux density B in the system of Gaussian units and is equal to Mx cm2 or g Bi s2, while the oersted is the unit of H field. One tesla corresponds to 104 gauss, and one ampere per metre corresponds to 4 10 3 oersted. The units for magnetic flux , which is the integral of magnetic B field over an area, are the weber in the SI and the maxwell in the CGS Gaussian system. The conversion factor is 108 maxwell per weber, since flux is the integral of field over an area, area having the units of the square of distance, thus 104 G T times the square of 102 cm m . 108 Mx Wb 104 G T 2.

            "text": "A Geissler tube is an early gas discharge tube used to demonstrate the principles of electrical glow discharge, similar to modern neon lighting. The tube was invented by the German physicist and glassblower Heinrich Geissler in 1857. It consists of a sealed, partially evacuated glass cylinder of various shapes with a metal electrode at each end, containing rarefied gasses such as neon, argon, or air; mercury vapor or other conductive fluids; or ionizable minerals or metals, such as sodium. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, an electrical current flows through the tube. The current dissociates electrons from the gas molecules, creating ions, and when the electrons recombine with the ions, the gas emits light by fluorescence. The color of light emitted is characteristic of the material within the tube, and many different colors and lighting effects can be achieved. The first gas discharge lamps, Geissler tubes were novelty items, made in many artistic shapes and colors to demonstrate the new science of electricity. In the early 20th century, the technology was commercialized and evolved into neon lighting.  Application  Geissler tubes were mass produced from the 1880s as novelty and entertainment devices, with various spherical chambers and decorative serpentine paths formed into the glass tube. Some tubes were very elaborate and complex in shape and would contain chambers within an outer casing. A novel effect could be obtained by spinning a glowing tube at high speed with a motor; a disk of color was seen due to persistence of vision. When an operating tube was touched by the hand, the shape of the glowing discharge inside often changed due to the capacitance of the body. Simple straight Geissler tubes were used in early 20th century scientific research as high voltage indicators. When a Geissler tube was brought near a source of high voltage, alternating current, such as a Tesla coil or Ruhmkorff coil, it would light up even without contact with the circuit. They were used to tune the tank circuits of radio transmitters to resonance. Another example of their use was to find nodes of standing waves on transmission lines, such as Lecher lines used to measure the frequency of early radio transmitters. Another use around 1900 was as the light source in Pulfrich refractometers.Geissler tubes are sometimes still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of gas discharge tubes.  Influence Geissler tubes were the first gas discharge tubes, and have had a large impact on the development of many instruments and devices which depend on electric discharge through gases. One of the most significant consequences of Geissler tube technology was the discovery of the electron and the invention of electronic vacuum tubes. By the 1870s better vacuum pumps enabled scientists to evacuate Geissler tubes to a higher vacuum; these were called Crookes tubes after William Crookes. When current was applied, it was found that the glass envelope of these tubes would glow at the end opposite to the cathode. Observing that sharp edged shadows were cast on the glowing tube wall by obstructions in the tube in front of the cathode, Johann Hittorf realized that the glow was caused by some type of ray travelling in straight lines through the tube from the cathode. These were named cathode rays. In 1897 J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays consisted of a previously unknown particle, which was named the electron. The technology of controlling electron beams resulted in the invention of the amplifying vacuum tube in 1907, which created the field of electronics and dominated it for 50 years, and the cathode ray tube which was used in radar and television displays. Some of the devices which evolved from Geissler tube technology: Vacuum tubes Xenon flash lamps Xenon arc lamps X ray tubes Sodium vapor lamps used in streetlights Neon signs, which use both visible light discharge from neon and other gases and phosphor excitation from ultraviolet light Mercury vapor lamps Mass spectrometers Cathode ray tubes, employed in the oscilloscope and later in television sets, radar, and computer display devices Electrotachyscope Fluorescent lamps Plasma globes  See also William Crookes Cathode ray tube Crookes tube Induction coil Neon sign Plasma globe X ray tube German inventions and discoveries  References   External links Sparkmuseum: Crookes and Geissler Tubes Instruments for Natural Philosophy: Geissler Tubes Mike's Electric Stuff: Geissler Tubes The Cathode Ray Tube site Geissler and Crookes tubes shown working How to Make an Experimental Geissler Tube, Popular Science monthly, February 1919, Unnumbered page, Scanned by Google Books.",
