# Lorebook Generator

This repo is designed to help all of us as authors using NovelAI. It pulls from Wikipedia articles to automatically generate lorebooks for real places or years and pretty much anything you could find on Wikipedia using python's wikipedia library.
The repo contains two different versions: a basic one that generates based on a CSV file, 'characters.csv' and a more advanced version that implements multiple keywords for a more tailored search.

Seeking Contributors that are skilled at project organization and formatting. This would be the first step in creating an open-source novel lorebook generator.
If interested, please contact me via discord! I will (of course) give credit where it's due for pull requests and such that are added to the repo. If this goes well, then maybe we can add some more features to the program, like web scraping historical documents or corpora from Project Gutenberg.
