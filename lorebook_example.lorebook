      "text": "Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла,[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[5][6][7] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.[8]\n\nBorn and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.[9]\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[10] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.[11] There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[12]\n\nAppearance\nPhotograph of Nikola Tesla, a slender, moustachioed man with a thin face and pointed chin.\nTesla c. 1896\nTesla was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64 kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. His appearance was described by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane as \"almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly\".[235][236] He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities, an appearance he maintained so as to further his business relationships.[237] He was also described as having light eyes, \"very big hands\", and \"remarkably big\" thumbs.[235]\n\nEidetic memory\nTesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.[238] He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.[239] Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light appeared before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.[238] Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail.[238] Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.[238]\n\nRelationships\nTesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.[238] He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This \"new woman\" was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"In place of the soft-voiced, a gentlewoman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.\"[240] Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work,[34] Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.\n\nTesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work.[138][241][242][243] However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force\".[34] His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul\".[237] Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink\".[244]\n\nTesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson,[245] Stanford White,[246] Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey.[247][248][249] In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere.[245] Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone\".[250] At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology.[251][252] In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.[253][254]\n\nTesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.[255] He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.[238] When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:\n\nHe had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.[256]\n\nSleep habits\nTesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night.[257] However, he did admit to \"dozing\" from time to time \"to recharge his batteries\".[258] During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.[259] On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest.[260] Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: \"I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.\"[258]\n\nWork habits\nTesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla then telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. \"The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla then resumed his work, often until 3:00 a.m.\"[261]\n\nFor exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16 km) per day. He curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.[258]\n\nIn an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, \"Suppose I made up my mind to murder you,\" he said, \"In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?\" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.[235]\n\nTesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.[221][262]\n\nViews and beliefs\nOn experimental and theoretical physics\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity.[263][264] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.[265]\n\nTesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.[266] He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:\n\nI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.[267]\n\nTesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892,[266] and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\". He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.[268] Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.[269]\n\nOn society\n\nTesla c. 1885\nTesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook.[270][271] This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.\n\nTesla expressed the belief that human \"pity\" had come to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\". Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:\n\n... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.[272]\n\nIn 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by \"Queen Bees\". He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.[273]\n\nTesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" (20 December 1914).[274] Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.[26][better source needed]\n\nOn religion\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\"[275] He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.[35][227]\nOn 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.[26]\nTwo days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings.[26] John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items, which were being held in custody.[26] After a three-day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:\n[Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.[228]\nIn a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's \"death ray\", Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.[229]\nGilded urn with Tesla's ashes, in his favorite geometric object, a sphere (Nikola Tesla Museum, Belgrade)\n \n \nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T.[26] In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade.[26] The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.[230]\n\n\n",

He attended school for only a few months. However, one biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own.[14] As a child, he became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.[15]\n\nEdison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness.[16] As he was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged[17] that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day historians and medical professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD.[15]\n\nIt is known that early in his career he enrolled in a chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, to support his work on a new telegraphy system with Charles Batchelor. This appears to have been his only enrollment in courses at an institution of higher learning.[18][19][20]\n\nEarly career\nThomas Edison began his career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments.[21] He became a telegraph operator after he saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.[22] He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.[23][24]\n\nEdison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers.[24] This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. Ultimately, his entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.[25][26]\n\nIn 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.[27]\n\nHis first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.[28] Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.[29]\n\nMenlo Park laboratory (1876–1886)\nResearch and development facility\n\nEdison's Menlo Park Laboratory, reconstructed at Greenfield Village at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan\nEdison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($228,700 in today's dollars[30]), which he gratefully accepted.[31] The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\n\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\".[32] Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague's contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison's mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm's Law, Joule's Law and economics.[33]\n\nNearly all of Edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.[34]\n\nIn just over a decade, Edison's Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \"a stock of almost every conceivable material\".[35] A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...\" and the list goes on.[36]\n\nOver his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous quotation: \"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\"[37] This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\n\nIn Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.[38] Edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.[39]\n\nPhonograph\n\nPhotograph of Edison with his phonograph (2nd model), taken in Mathew Brady's Washington, D.C. studio in April 1878\n\nMary Had a Little Lamb (0:16)\nMENU0:00\nThomas Edison reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" in 1929.\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877.[40] This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\".[5]\n\nHis first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\".[41] In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes.[42] The Washington Post described Edison as a \"genius\" and his presentation as \"a scene... that will live in history\".[43] Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[44] he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\n\nCarbon telephone transmitter\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \"transmitter\") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\n\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.[45] His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitter's invention[46]) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).[45][47]\n\nEdison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union.[46] In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890[46] and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\n\nElectric light\nMain article: Incandescent light bulb\n\nThomas Edison's first successful model of light bulb, used in public demonstration at Menlo Park, December 1879\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting.[48] He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb.[49] In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success.[50] Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer,[51] William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel.\n\nThese early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.[52]: 217–218  In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament.[53] Edison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\".[54]\n\nThe patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\".[54] It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200 hours.[55]\n\n\nU.S. Patent #223898: Electric-Lamp, issued January 27, 1880\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[56] and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\"[57]\n\n\nThe Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company's new steamship, the Columbia, was the first commercial application for Edison's incandescent light bulb in 1880.\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison's 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard's company's new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard's request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia's new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.[58][59][60][61]\n\nIn 1880, Lewis Latimer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation, began working for the United States Electric Lighting Company run by Edison's rival Hiram S. Maxim.[62] While working for Maxim, Latimer invented a process for making carbon filaments for light bulbs and helped install broad-scale lighting systems for New York City, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London. Latimer holds the patent for the electric lamp issued in 1881, and a second patent for the “process of manufacturing carbons” (the filament used in incandescent light bulbs), issued in 1882.\n\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison's patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years. In 1885, Latimer switched camps and started working with Edison.[63] On October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison's electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid.[64] To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison's, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\n\nThe incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well. Mahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison's electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.[65] In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre.[66] The first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson's textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882.[67]\n\nElectric power distribution\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \"utility\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.[68] On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.[69]\n\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\n\nWar of currents\nMain article: War of the currents\n\nExtravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition.\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.[70] Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\n\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\"[71] Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.[72] Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.[73]\n\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines. This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.[74][75] Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \"battle of currents\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.[76][77]\n\nWest Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931)\n\nThomas A. Edison Industries Exhibit, Primary Battery section, 1915\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \"Glenmont\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 (equivalent to $79,210 in 2020) and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat.[78] The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture. The building materials were pre-cut in New England by the Kennebec Framing Company and the Stephen Nye Lumber Company of Fairfield Maine. The materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings.[79] Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.[80]\n\nDue to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.[81]\n\nEdison became concerned with America's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber. Edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.[82]\n\nThe laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project, while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.[83] After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.[84]\n\nDuring the 1911 New York Electrical show, Edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he didn't have a \"chunk of it\". The representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the \"continuous stimulation in the copper industry\".[85][86][87]\n\nOther inventions and projects\nFluoroscopy\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\n\nThe fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.[88]\n\nIn 1903, a shaken Edison said: \"Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\"[89] Nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today.[90]\n\nTasimeter\nEdison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation. His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878. The device was not patented since Edison could find no practical mass-market application for it.[91]\n\nTelegraph improvements\nThe key to Edison's initial reputation and success was his work in the field of telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This, together with his studies in chemistry at the Cooper Union, allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system.[18][19] His innovations also included the development of the quadruplex, the first system which could simultaneously transmit four messages through a single wire.[92]\n\nMotion pictures\nFile:Leonard Cushing Kinetograph 1894.ogv\nThe June 1894 Leonard–Cushing bout. Each of the six one-minute rounds recorded by the Kinetoscope was made available to exhibitors for $22.50.[93] Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown.\nEdison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, labeled the \"Kinetograph\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson.[52] In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.[94]\n\nIn April 1896, Thomas Armat's Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\n\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when wealthy American businessman Irving T. Bush (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck[95] of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\n\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.[96]\n\nOn May 14, 1895, the Edison's Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.[96]\n\nEdison's film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott's Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\n\nFile:A day with Thomas A. Edison.webm\nA Day with Thomas Edison (1922)\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.[97] To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.[98]\n\nIn 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\n\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \"spoiled everything\" for him. \"There isn't any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\"[99] His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.[100]\n\nMining\nStarting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.[101]\n\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[102] A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\n\nRechargeable battery\nFurther information: Nickel–iron battery § History\n\nShare of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued October 19, 1903\nIn the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an \"accumulator\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.[103] The then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel–iron battery by the Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner.[104]\n\nEdison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company, and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects, with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was exhausted, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel–iron battery was never very successful; by the time it was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for turning over gas-powered car starter motors.[104]\n\nChemicals\nAt the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive. Most chemicals were imported from Europe. The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals. One of particular importance to Edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records—presumably as phenolic resins of the Bakelite type.\n\nAt the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting. Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells. A telling of the phenol story is found in The Aspirin Wars.[105] Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate. Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.\n\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake facility using processes developed by his chemists.[106] He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day. Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe. He built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany. Edison also manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust. Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax. Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable. In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\nPhenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. Bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. Aspirin, too was a phenol derivative. Invented in 1899, it had become a block buster drug. Bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in Rensselaer, New York, but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war. Edison was able to oblige.\n\nBayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in Piscataway, New Jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin. (See Great Phenol plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate. Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses. He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to salicylic acid by Heyden, some of which was exported.\n\nSpirit Phone\nIn 1920, Edison spoke to American Magazine, saying that he had been working on a device for some time to see if it was possible to communicate with the dead.[107][108] Edison said the device would work on scientific principles not by an occult means.[107] The announcement caused a press heyday,[108][107] though the actual nature of this invention remained a mystery, as there were no details for some time. Until In 2015, Philippe Baudouin, a French journalist, found a copy of Edison's Diary in a thrift store with a chapter not found in the previously published editions. The new chapter details Edison's theories of the afterlife and the scientific basis by which communication with them might be achieved.[107]\n\nFinal years and death\nFinal years\n\nHenry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Harvey Firestone, respectively. Ft. Myers, Florida, February 11, 1929\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated.\n\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\"[109] He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\n\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.[110]\n\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.[110]\n\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\".[52] He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \"Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\"[111] She also said that during one of his periodic \"great scientific adventures\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.[99]\n\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.[112]\n\nDeath\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \"Glenmont\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben officiated at the funeral;[113] Edison is buried behind the home.[114][115]\n\nEdison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.[116] A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made.[117] Mina died in 1947.\n\nMarriages and children\nOn December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\n\nMarion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed \"Dot\"[118]\nThomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed \"Dash\"[119]\nWilliam Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.[120]\nMary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor[121] or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.[122]\n\nEdison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.[39]\n\n\nMina Miller Edison in 1906\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947) in Akron, Ohio.[123] She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\n\nMadeleine Edison (1888–1979), who married John Eyre Sloane.[124][125]\nCharles Edison (1890–1969), Governor of New Jersey (1941–1944), who took over his father's company and experimental laboratories upon his father's death.[126]\nTheodore Miller Edison (1898–1992), (MIT Physics 1923), credited with more than 80 patents.\nMina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.[127][128]\n\nWanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison's son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr., became a problem for his father and his father's business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as \"The Latest Edison Discovery\". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35 (equivalent to $1,008 in 2020)[30] per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his half-brother Charles.[129][130]\n\nViews\nOn religion, and metaphysics\n\nThis 1910 New York Times Magazine feature states that \"Nature, the supreme power, (Edison) recognizes and respects, but does not worship. Nature is not merciful and loving, but wholly merciless, indifferent.\" Edison is quoted as saying \"I am not an individual—I am an aggregate of cells, as, for instance, New York City is an aggregate of individuals. Will New York City go to heaven?\"\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \"freethinker\".[52] Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason.[52] Edison defended Paine's \"scientific deism\", saying, \"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\"[52] In 1878, Edison joined the Theosophical Society in New Jersey,[131] but according to its founder, H. P. Blavatsky, he was not a very active member.[132] In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\n\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me—the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love—He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us—nature did it all—not the gods of the religions.[133]\n\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\n\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.[52]\n\nHe also stated, \"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\"[134] In 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \"spirit phone\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.[135] Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\"[136]\n\nOn politics\nEdison was a supporter of women's suffrage.[137] He said in 1915, \"Every woman in this country is going to have the vote.\"[137] Edison notably signed onto a statement supporting women's suffrage which was published to counter anti-suffragist literature spread by Senator James Edgar Martine.[138]\n\nNonviolence was key to Edison's political and moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\" Edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\"[139][140] He was a vegetarian[141] but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.[52] Following a tour of Europe in 1911, Edison spoke negatively about \"the belligerent nationalism that he had sensed in every country he visited”.[142]\n\nEdison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times as stating: \"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\"[143] In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. Edison argued that, if the government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.[143]\n\nIn May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\".[144] In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were abandoned.[145][146]\n\nAwards\n\nPortrait of Edison by Abraham Archibald Anderson (1890), National Portrait Gallery\nThe following is an incomplete list of awards given to Edison during his lifetime and posthumously:\n\nIn 1878, Edison was awarded an honorary PhD from Union College[147]\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grévy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Légion d'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881;[148] Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.[149]\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal. In 1890, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nThe Philadelphia City Council named Edison the recipient of the John Scott Medal in 1889.[149]\nIn 1899, Edison was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of The Franklin Institute.[150]\nHe was named an Honorable Consulting Engineer at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition World's fair in 1904.[149]\nIn 1908, Edison received the American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal.[149]\nIn 1915, Edison was awarded Franklin Medal of The Franklin Institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.[151]\nIn 1920, the United States Navy department awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.[149]\nIn 1923, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers created the Edison Medal and he was its first recipient.[149]\nIn 1927, he was granted membership in the National Academy of Sciences.[149]\nOn May 29, 1928, Edison received the Congressional Gold Medal.[149]\nIn 1983, the United States Congress, pursuant to Senate Joint Resolution 140 (Public Law 97–198), designated February 11, Edison's birthday, as National Inventor's Day.[152]\nLife magazine (USA), in a special double issue in 1997, placed Edison first in the list of the \"100 Most Important People in the Last 1000 Years\", noting that the light bulb he promoted \"lit up the world\". In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the governor and cabinet of Florida.[153]\nTributes\nPlaces and people named for Edison\n\nThomas Edison commemorative stamp, issued on the 100th anniversary of his birth in 1947\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edison Community College in Piqua, Ohio.[154] There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pelé's father originally named him Edison, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \"Edson\".[155]\n\nThe small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison's middle name.\n\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison's three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison's return to the city on 1922.[156]\n\nIn 1954, Lake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.[157]\n\nEdison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.[158]\n\nThree bridges around the United States have been named in Edison's honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey,[159] the Edison Bridge in Florida,[160] and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.[161]\n\nIn space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\n\nMount Edison in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named after him in 1955.[162]\n\nMuseums and memorials\n\nStatue of young Thomas Edison by the railroad tracks in Port Huron, Michigan. The Blue Water Bridge can be seen in the background.\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \"Black Maria\"—the world's first movie studio.[163] The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey.[164] In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.[165] The Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum.[166] The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison's parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\n\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the light bulb.[167] On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\n\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.[168]\n\nHenry Ford had Edison's name inscribed over the main doorway of the Ford Engineering Laboratory.\n\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.[169]\n\nCompanies bearing Edison's name\n\nEdison in 1915\nEdison General Electric, merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric\nCommonwealth Edison, now part of Exelon\nConsolidated Edison\nEdison International\nDetroit Edison, a unit of DTE Energy\nEdison S.p.A., a unit of Italenergia\nTrade association the Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying and research group for investor-owned utilities in the United States\nEdison Ore-Milling Company\nEdison Portland Cement Company\nOhio Edison (merged with Centerior in 1997 to form First Energy)\nSouthern California Edison\nAwards named in honor of Edison\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts\".\n\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\n\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers has awarded the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award since 1997 to individual patents that demonstrate a significant impact on the practice of mechanical engineering.[170]\n\nOther items named after Edison\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II.[171] In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.[172]\n\nIn popular culture\nMain article: Thomas Edison in popular culture\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.[173]\n\nOn February 11, 2011, on what would have been Thomas Edison's 164th birthday, Google's homepage featured an animated Google Doodle commemorating his many inventions. When the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a light bulb to glow.[174]\n\nPeople who worked for Edison\nThe following is a list of people who worked for Thomas Edison in his laboratories at Menlo Park or West Orange or at the subsidiary electrical businesses that he supervised.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Mina Miller Edison: A Valuable Partner to Thomas Edison\nMina Miller Edison: A Valuable Partner to Thomas EdisonMina Miller Edison (1865-1947) was the second wife of Thomas Edison. He married her in 1886 after the death of his first wife, Mary Stillwell Edison, in 1884.\n\nWhere Mary had been a woman of simple means, a worker in his Newark factory…..Mina was poised, the daughter of parents of culture and good upbringing in Akron, Ohio. Her father Lewis was an inventor himself of farm machinery, having much of the inventive spirit in common with his soon-to-be, son-in-law, Thomas Edison. As it would turn out, Mina would become the daughter, wife and mother of inventors. Her son Theodore Edison would also take up an inventive life, although he would never achieve the acclaim his father enjoyed.\n\nLewis Miller played a key role in establishing the famous retreat, Chautauqua in upper, western New York State. This kind of exposure to people of stature and mixing with highly educated folks helped groom Mina for the societal role she would play with a world renowned husband.\n\nMina and Tom\nMina Miller Edison: A Valuable Partner to Thomas EdisonWhen Thomas and Mina joined, she became the matriarch of a huge 23 room mansion in West Orange, near Edison’s new West Orange laboratories; a 13 acre estate that included the home (Glenmont), a barn, greenhouse, garage, farm animals, and tended grounds. Thomas bought her the magnificent Queen Anne style Victorian mansion as a wedding gift. Mina was 19 and Thomas 39; and along came three children by his first marriage-Marion, Thomas Jr., and William. Marion the oldest, was already 12, just 7 years younger than Mina, making her job as a young mother that much more difficult. Mina would then have three children of her own-Madeline, Charles, and Theodore.\n\nUnlike Mary, Mina was up to the challenge of an already famous husband. While she adored him as Mary did, this adoration was not overwhelming. Mina had been around famous people all her life and was raised to “take charge” of situations. She became a loving wife, business confidant, and home executive, all the while boosting Edison and his burgeoning reputation and public acclaim.\n\nShe handled his very busy social calendar, dinner parties, and public relations so he could remain doing what he did best…..to invent breakthrough technologies and industries. Mina rose to the demanding rigors of her husband’s fame and busy schedule. Many nights would pass with Edison spending long hours at the lab or personally supervising critical work at job sites. This was tough on Mina and the children, but she not only persisted in protecting her husband’s privacy, and keeping his social calendar in order, she was an important asset to his business, his de facto public relations department.\n\nMina Miller Edison: A Valuable Partner to Thomas EdisonThe mansion was the site of many famous guests such as Presidents Hoover and Wilson; the kings of Sweden and Siam; environmentalist John Burroughs and Maria Montessori-the famed educator; General “Black Jack” Pershing and Helen Keller; industrialists: Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone, and George Eastman. There were also Orville Wright, Charles Lindbergh, and variety of others, including famed musical artists that Edison had recorded on his phonograph records. Against this backdrop of fame and notoriety, Mina entertained, brought up her children, managed the large estate, and carved out a meaningful life of her own.\n\nMina became a potent force for the conservation movement then picking up momentum. The rapid growth of cities and their encroachment on pristine areas was a major concern. Men like John Burroughs and others greatly influenced Mina’s thinking…..and she most likely had input to the great movement to preserve wild areas, very much in the spirit that helped establish our national system of parks.\n\nShe was also an avid bird watcher and horticulturalist. Mina transformed  Glenmont’s fertile grounds into a botanical wonderland—-planting trees, shrubs, and plant species from around the world there. Today still, the air around Glenmont is very much alive with the smells and aromas of blooming plants and trees.\n\nMina also gave of her talents to the surrounding communities, working tirelessly on various social, educational, religious, and community causes for the benefits of citizens great and small. She did her best to give back to her community, and in doing so, create a solid reputation of citizenship, while at the same time shedding light upon her husband’s business. Her philanthropy was well-known. She had a most beautiful philosophy about education, maintaining that only through a traditional and classic liberal education do we make citizens ready for the wonderful democracy that we enjoy.\n\nHer life-long interest in learning, studying foreign cultures, and giving her talents back to the community were all probably formed early in her youth with her father’s founding of Chautauqua, a beautiful outdoor retreat on the southern shore of Lake Erie. There with Bishop Vincent of Akron, Ohio, her father Lewis Miller established a religious retreat that emphasized worldly learning and fostered continued learning to better understand people and ideas. Every summer in August for most of her life, Mina retreated to the bucolic splendor of this lakeside oasis for mental and spiritual rejuvenation. This state of continuous learning meshed well with Thomas’s constant quest to learn and study his own interests. In the big world of new ideas and creative thinking, she and Thomas were in perfect harmony. Lovely Glenmont is a warm home, filled with books and opportunities for learning.\n\nToday, Chautauqua remains a place of learning and understanding, whether for religious or other purposes. It is a name that describes both a philosophy and a geographical location. It is an invention of spirit and mind, no less important than Edison’s physical manifestations of technology.\n\nA Loving Partnership\nMina Miller Edison: A Valuable Partner to Thomas EdisonThere was a lovely partnership in the Thomas-Mina marriage, even if Thomas was often away from home for days at a time. She came to understand his greatness and to share him with the world. She shielded him from the distractions, and annoyances that could sap his creative energies.\n\nIn the large upstairs living room of Glenmont, sit two desks, one for Thomas and the other for Mina, signifying that both worked hard and in close proximity. Like the invention process going on at the Edison labs every day, their marriage was a partnership, of mutual respect, purpose, and love. Had she not provided such a nurturing environment for creative Thomas to dwell within, we may not have enjoyed (or been delayed in realizing) many of the advances that he achieved.\n\nToday, Thomas and Mina rest side-by-side in a peaceful memorial garden area behind their beautiful home, the entire estate lovingly preserved for visitors from all over the world to enjoy, and reflect upon. Thousands of visitors tour Glenmont every year, marveling at the profound work done here by both husband and wife.",

In 1929, Marconi was ennobled as a Marchese (marquis) by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and, in 1931, he set up Vatican Radio for Pope Pius XI.\n\n\nContents\n1\tBiography\n1.1\tEarly years\n1.2\tEducation\n1.3\tRadio work\n1.3.1\tDeveloping radio telegraphy\n1.3.2\tTransmission breakthrough\n1.3.3\tDemonstrations and achievements\n1.3.4\tTransatlantic transmissions\n1.3.5\tTitanic\n1.3.6\tContinuing work\n1.4\tLater years\n2\tPersonal life\n3\tLegacy and honours\n3.1\tOrders and decorations\n3.2\tHonours and awards\n3.3\tTributes\n3.4\tPlaces and organisations named after Marconi\n3.4.1\tOuter space\n3.4.2\tEurope\n3.4.3\tOceania\n3.4.4\tNorth America\n3.4.5\tUnited States\n4\tPatents\n4.1\tBritish patents\n4.2\tUS patents\n4.3\tReissued (US)\n5\tSee also\n6\tReferences\n7\tSources\n8\tFurther reading\n9\tExternal links\nBiography\nEarly years\nMarconi was born into the Italian nobility as Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi[10] in Palazzo Marescalchi in Bologna on 25 April 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi (an Italian aristocratic landowner from Porretta Terme) and his Irish wife Annie Jameson (daughter of Andrew Jameson of Daphne Castle in County Wexford, Ireland, and granddaughter of John Jameson, founder of whiskey distillers Jameson & Sons).[11][12] Marconi had a brother, Alfonso, and a stepbrother, Luigi. Between the ages of two and six, Marconi and his elder brother Alfonso lived with their mother in the English town of Bedford.[13][14]\n\nEducation\nMarconi did not attend school as a child and did not go on to formal higher education.[15][16][17] Instead, he learned chemistry, mathematics, and physics at home from a series of private tutors hired by his parents. His family hired additional tutors for Guglielmo in the winter when they would leave Bologna for the warmer climate of Tuscany or Florence.[17] Marconi noted an important mentor was professor Vincenzo Rosa, a high school physics teacher in Livorno.[18][16] Rosa taught the 17-year-old Marconi the basics of physical phenomena as well as new theories on electricity. At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became acquainted with University of Bologna physicist Augusto Righi, who had done research on Heinrich Hertz's work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.[19]\n\nRadio work\nFrom youth, Marconi was interested in science and electricity. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of \"wireless telegraphy\"—i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric conduction, electromagnetic induction and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from Heinrich Hertz, who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect electromagnetic radiation, based on the work of James Clerk Maxwell. At the time, this radiation was commonly called \"Hertzian\" waves, and is now generally referred to as radio waves.[20]\n\nThere was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method. Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a line of sight path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.[21] Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist Oliver Lodge and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi. Righi's article renewed Marconi's interest in developing a wireless telegraphy system based on radio waves,[22] a line of inquiry that Marconi noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing.[23]\n\nMarconi's Alien Encounter was in 1920\n“I have encountered during my experiments with wireless telegraphy [a] most amazing phenomenon,” wrote Marconi. “Most striking of all is receipt by me personally of signals which I believe originated in the space beyond our planet. I believe it is entirely possible that these signals may have been sent by the inhabitants of other planets to the inhabitants of earth.”\n\n\nDeveloping radio telegraphy\n\nMarconi's first transmitter incorporating a monopole antenna. It consisted of an elevated copper sheet (top) connected to a Righi spark gap (left) powered by an induction coil (center) with a telegraph key (right) to switch it on and off to spell out text messages in Morse code.\nAt the age of 20, Marconi began to conduct experiments in radio waves, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of Sasso Marconi), Italy, with the help of his butler, Mignani. Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a coherer, an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Édouard Branly and used in Lodge's experiments, that changed resistance when exposed to radio waves.[24] In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nLate one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.[25][24] Supported by his father, Marconi continued to read through the literature and picked up on the ideas of physicists who were experimenting with radio waves. He developed devices, such as portable transmitters and receiver systems, that could work over long distances,[23] turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system.[26] Marconi came up with a functional system with many components:[27]\n\nA relatively simple oscillator or spark-producing radio transmitter;\nA wire or metal sheet capacity area suspended at a height above the ground;\nA coherer receiver, which was a modification of Édouard Branly's original device with refinements to increase sensitivity and reliability;\nA telegraph key to operate the transmitter to send short and long pulses, corresponding to the dots-and-dashes of Morse code; and\nA telegraph register activated by the coherer which recorded the received Morse code dots and dashes onto a roll of paper tape.\nIn the summer of 1895, Marconi moved his experiments outdoors on his father's estate in Bologna. He tried different arrangements and shapes of antenna but even with improvements he was able to transmit signals only up to one half-mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves.[28]\n\nTransmission breakthrough\nA breakthrough came in the summer of 1895, when Marconi found that much greater range could be achieved after he raised the height of his antenna and, borrowing from a technique used in wired telegraphy, grounded his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements, the system was capable of transmitting signals up to 2 miles (3.2 km) and over hills.[29][30] The monopole antenna reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the dipole antennas used by Hertz, and radiated vertically polarized radio waves which could travel longer distances. By this point, he concluded that a device could become capable of spanning greater distances, with additional funding and research, and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful radio transmission system.[31][32][33]\n\nMarconi applied to the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs, then under the direction of Maggiorino Ferraris[34], explaining his wireless telegraph machine and asking for funding, but never received a response. An apocryphal tale claims that the minister (incorrectly named first as Emilio Sineo, later as Pietro Lacava[35]) wrote \"to the Longara\" on the document, referring to the insane asylum on Via della Lungara in Rome, but the letter was never found.[36]\n\nIn 1896, Marconi spoke with his family friend Carlo Gardini, Honorary Consul at the United States Consulate in Bologna, about leaving Italy to go to Great Britain. Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, Annibale Ferrero, explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to Britain, where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use. Finding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at Dover, and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of William Preece, the Chief Electrical Engineer of the General Post Office (the GPO). During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled \"Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor\", which would become the first patent for a radio wave based communication system.[37]\n\nDemonstrations and achievements\n‹ The template below (More citations needed section) is being considered for merging.

The transmitter is at centre, the coherer receiver below it, and the pole supporting the wire antenna is visible at top.\nMarconi made the first demonstration of his system for the British government in July 1896.[38] A further series of demonstrations for the British followed, and, by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) across Salisbury Plain. On 13 May 1897, Marconi sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea – a message was transmitted over the Bristol Channel from Flat Holm Island to Lavernock Point near Cardiff, a distance of 6 kilometres (3.7 mi). The message read, \"Are you ready\".[39] The transmitting equipment was almost immediately relocated to Brean Down Fort on the Somerset coast, stretching the range to 16 kilometres (9.9 mi).\n\n\nPlaque on the outside of the BT Centre commemorates Marconi's first public transmission of wireless signals.\nImpressed by these and other demonstrations, Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures: \"Telegraphy without Wires\", at the Toynbee Hall on 11 December 1896; and \"Signalling through Space without Wires\", given to the Royal Institution on 4 June 1897.[40][41]\n\nNumerous additional demonstrations followed, and Marconi began to receive international attention. In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at La Spezia, in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyd's between The Marine Hotel in Ballycastle and Rathlin Island, both in County Antrim in Ulster, Ireland, was conducted on 6 July 1898 by George Kemp and Edward Edwin Glanville.[42] A transmission across the English channel was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from Wimereux, France to South Foreland Lighthouse, England. Marconi set up an experimental base at the Haven Hotel, Sandbanks, Poole Harbour, Dorset, where he erected a 100-foot high mast. He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, and his steam yacht, the Elettra, was often moored on Brownsea or at The Haven Hotel. Marconi purchased the vessel after the Great War and converted it to a seaborne laboratory from where he conducted many of his experiments. Among the Elettra's crew was Adelmo Landini, his personal radio operator, who was also an inventor.[43]\n\nIn December 1898, the British lightship service authorised the establishment of wireless communication between the South Foreland lighthouse at Dover and the East Goodwin lightship, twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent the first SOS message, a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel Elbe which had run aground on Goodwin Sands. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the Ramsgate lifeboat.[44][45]\n\n\nSS Ponce entering New York Harbor 1899, by Milton J. Burns\nIn the autumn of 1899, his first demonstration in the United States took place. Marconi had sailed to the U.S. at the invitation of The New York Herald newspaper to cover the America's Cup international yacht races off Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The transmission was done aboard the SS Ponce, a passenger ship of the Porto Rico Line.[46] Marconi left for England on 8 November 1899 on the American Line's SS Saint Paul, and he and his assistants installed wireless equipment aboard during the voyage. Prior to this voyage the Second Boer War had begun, and Marconi's wireless would bring news of the conflict to passengers at the request of \"some of the officials of the American line.\"[47] On 15 November the SS Saint Paul became the first ocean liner to report her imminent return to Great Britain by wireless when Marconi's Royal Needles Hotel radio station contacted her 66 nautical miles off the English coast. The first Transatlantic Times, a newspaper containing wireless transmission news from the Needles Station at the Isle of Wight, was published onboard the SS Saint Paul prior to its arrival.[48]\n\nTransatlantic transmissions\n\nMarconi watching associates raising the kite (a \"Levitor\" by B.F.S. Baden-Powell[49]) used to lift the antenna at St. John's, Newfoundland, December 1901\n\nMagnetic detector by Marconi used during the experimental campaign aboard a ship in summer 1902, exhibited at the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci of Milan.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Marconi began investigating a means to signal across the Atlantic to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall, England, and Clifden in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at Signal Hill in St. John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada), on 12 December 1901, using a 500-foot (150 m) kite-supported antenna for reception—signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles (3,500 km). It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was—and continues to be—considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency ≈ 850 kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter S. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.[50][51]\n\n\nMarconi demonstrating apparatus he used in his first long-distance radio transmissions in the 1890s. The transmitter is at right, the receiver with paper tape recorder at left.\n\nMarconi caricatured by Leslie Ward for Vanity Fair, 1905\nFeeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS Philadelphia sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced coherer-tape reception up to 1,550 miles (2,490 km), and audio reception up to 2,100 miles (3,400 km). The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for medium wave and longwave transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about 700 miles (1,100 km), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres (miles), despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n\nOn 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts, that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President Theodore Roosevelt to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.[52]\n\nMarconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907[53][54] between Clifden, Ireland, and Glace Bay, but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication to others.\n\nTitanic\nThe role played by Marconi Co. wireless in maritime rescues raised public awareness of the value of radio and brought fame to Marconi, particularly the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912 and the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915.[55]\n\nRMS Titanic radio operators Jack Phillips and Harold Bride were not employed by the White Star Line but by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company. After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the RMS Carpathia of the Cunard Line.[56] The Carpathia took a total of 17 minutes to both receive and decode the SOS signal sent by the Titanic. There was a distance of 58 miles between the two ships.[57] When Carpathia docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from The New York Times to talk with Bride, the surviving operator.[56] After this incident, Marconi gained popularity and became more recognised for his contributions to the field of radio and wireless technology.[58]\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Titanic regarding the marine telegraphy's functions and the procedures for emergencies at sea.[59] Britain's Postmaster-General summed up, referring to the Titanic disaster: \"Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi ... and his marvellous invention.\"[60] Marconi was offered free passage on the Titanic before she sank, but had taken the Lusitania three days earlier. As his daughter Degna later explained, he had paperwork to do and preferred the public stenographer aboard that vessel.[61]\n\nContinuing work\nOver the years, the Marconi companies gained a reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous-wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication. In 1924, the Marconi Company co-established the Unione Radiofonica Italiana (now RAI).[62]\n\nLater years\nHave I done the world good, or have I added a menace?[63]\n\nIn 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in the UK. During World War I, Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service. He attained the rank of lieutenant in the Italian Royal Army and of commander in the Regia Marina. In 1929, he was made a marquess by King Victor Emmanuel III.[64]\n\n\nVilla Marconi, with Marconi's tomb in foreground.\nWhile helping to develop microwave technology, the Marchese Marconi suffered nine heart attacks in the span of three years preceding his death.[65] Marconi died in Rome on 20 July 1937 at age 63, following the ninth, fatal, heart attack, and Italy held a state funeral for him. As a tribute, shops on the street where he lived were \"Closed for national mourning\".[66] In addition, at 6 pm the next day, the time designated for the funeral, transmitters around the world observed two minutes of silence in his honour.[67] The British Post Office also sent a message requesting that all broadcasting ships honour Marconi with two minutes of broadcasting silence.[66] His remains are housed in the Mausoleum of Guglielmo Marconi in the grounds of Villa Griffone at Sasso Marconi, Emilia-Romagna, which assumed that name in his honour in 1938.[68]\n\nIn 1943, Marconi's elegant sailing yacht, the Elettra, was commandeered and refitted as a warship by the German Navy. She was sunk by the RAF on 22 January 1944. After the war, the Italian Government tried to retrieve the wreckage, to rebuild the boat, and the wreckage was removed to Italy. Eventually, the idea was abandoned, and the wreckage was cut into pieces which were distributed amongst Italian museums.\n\nIn 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a decision on Marconi's radio patents restoring some of the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone Stone, and Nikola Tesla.[69][70] The decision was not about Marconi's original radio patents[71] and the court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents was questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents.[72] There are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the United States government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring the non-Marconi prior patent.[69]\n\nPersonal life\n\nAmerican electrical engineer Alfred Norton Goldsmith and Marconi on 26 June 1922.\nMarconi was a friend of Charles van Raalte and his wife Florence, the owners of Brownsea Island; and of Margherita, their daughter, and in 1904 he met her Irish friend, The Hon. Beatrice O'Brien (1882–1976), a daughter of The 14th Baron Inchiquin. On 16 March 1905, Beatrice O'Brien and Marconi were married, and spent their honeymoon on Brownsea Island.[73] They had three daughters, Degna (1908–1998), Gioia (1916–1996), and Lucia (born and died 1906), and a son, Giulio, 2nd Marchese Marconi (1910–1971). In 1913, the Marconi family returned to Italy and became part of Rome society. Beatrice served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elena. At Marconi's request, his marriage to Beatrice was annulled on 27 April 1927, so he could remarry.[74] Marconi and Beatrice had divorced on 12 February 1924 in the free city of Fiume (Rijeka).\n\n\nGuglielmo and Beatrice Marconi c. 1910\nOn 12 June 1927 Marconi went on to marry Maria Cristina Bezzi-Scali (2 April 1900 – 15 July 1994), the only daughter of Francesco, Count Bezzi-Scali. To do this he had to be confirmed in the Catholic faith and became a devout member of the Church.[75] He was baptised Catholic but had been brought up as a member of the Anglican Church. On 12 June 1927, Marconi married Maria Cristina in a civil service, with a religious ceremony performed on 15 June. Marconi was 53 years old and Maria Cristina was 26. They had one daughter, Maria Elettra Elena Anna (born 1930), who married Prince Carlo Giovannelli (1942–2016) in 1966; they later divorced. For unexplained reasons, Marconi left his entire fortune to his second wife and their only child, and nothing to the children of his first marriage.[76]\n\nMarconi joined the Italian Fascist party in 1923.[77] In 1930, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini appointed him President of the Royal Academy of Italy, which made Marconi a member of the Fascist Grand Council. Marconi was an apologist for fascist ideology and actions such as the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.[78]\n\nIn his lecture he stated: \"I reclaim the honour of being the first fascist in the field of radiotelegraphy, the first who acknowledged the utility of joining the electric rays in a bundle, as Mussolini was the first in the political field who acknowledged the necessity of merging all the healthy energies of the country into a bundle, for the greater greatness of Italy\".[79]\n\nMarconi wanted to personally introduce in 1931 the first radio broadcast of a Pope, Pius XI, and did announce at the microphone: \"With the help of God, who places so many mysterious forces of nature at man's disposal, I have been able to prepare this instrument which will give to the faithful of the entire world the joy of listening to the voice of the Holy Father\".[80]\n\nLegacy and honours\nOrders and decorations\nItalian\nKnight of the Order of Merit for Labour (26 October 1902)[81]\nKnight of the Civil Order of Savoy (1 June 1905)[81]\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy (7 April 1913; Grand Officer: 30 October 1902; Officer: 6 January 1898)[81]\nGrand Cordon of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (14 January 1932; Grand Officer: 30 May 1912; Commander: 12 January 1902)[81][82][64]\nMarquis of Marconi (17 July 1929)[81]\nOthers\nGrand Cross of the Order of Saint Anna of the Russia Empire (1902)[83][64]\nHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order of the United Kingdom (GCVO, 1914)[64]\nGrand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso XII of Spain[81]\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun of Japan (1933)[84]\nHonours and awards\n\nMemorial plaque in the Basilica Santa Croce, Florence.

Between the ages of two and six, Marconi and his elder brother Alfonso lived with their mother in the English town of Bedford.[15][16]\nAt the age of 20, Marconi began to conduct experiments in radio waves, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of Sasso Marconi), Italy with the help of his butler, Mignani.

After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the RMS Carpathia of the Cunard Line.[49] Also employed by the Marconi Company was David Sarnoff, who later headed RCA. Wireless communications were reportedly maintained for 72 hours between Carpathia and Sarnoff,[50] but Sarnoff's involvement has been questioned by some modern historians. When Carpathia docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from The New York Times to talk with Bride, the surviving operator.[49]\nALso part of the olympic name switch coverup\nBlackmailed by something he sees which gets him in a group with Marconi and the Pope\n\nMarconi was also an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in the United Kingdom in 1897 (which became the Marconi Company). He succeeded in making an engineering and commercial success of radio by innovating and building on the work of previous experimenters and physicists.[10][11] In 1929, Marconi was ennobled as a Marchese (marquis) by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and, in 1931, he set up Vatican Radio for Pope Pius XI. \n\n\n",

Known as the Victorian era, her reign of 63 years and seven months was longer than any previous British monarch. It was a period of industrial, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. In 1876, the British Parliament voted to grant her the additional title of Empress of India.\n\nVictoria was the daughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (the fourth son of King George III), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. After the deaths of her father and grandfather in 1820, she was raised under close supervision by her mother and her comptroller, John Conroy. She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Though a constitutional monarch, Victoria privately attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\n\nVictoria married her first cousin Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840. Their children married into royal and noble families across the continent, earning Victoria the sobriquet \"the grandmother of Europe\" and spreading haemophilia in European royalty. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, British republicanism temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration. She died on the Isle of Wight in 1901. The last British monarch of the House of Hanover, she was succeeded by her son Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\n\nContents\n1\tBirth and family\n2\tHeir presumptive\n3\tEarly reign\n3.1\tAccession\n3.2\tMarriage\n4\tMarried reign\n5\tWidowhood\n5.1\tEmpress\n6\tLater years\n6.1\tGolden Jubilee\n6.2\tDiamond Jubilee\n6.3\tDeath and succession\n7\tLegacy\n7.1\tDescendants and haemophilia\n7.2\tNamesakes\n8\tTitles, styles, honours, and arms\n8.1\tTitles and styles\n8.2\tHonours\n8.2.1\tBritish honours\n8.2.2\tForeign honours\n8.3\tArms\n9\tFamily\n9.1\tIssue\n9.2\tAncestry\n9.3\tFamily tree\n10\tNotes\n11\tReferences\n11.1\tCitations\n11.2\tBibliography\n11.2.1\tPrimary sources\n12\tFurther reading\n13\tExternal links\nBirth and family\nPortrait of Victoria at age 4\nVictoria at age four, by Stephen Poyntz Denning (1823)\nVictoria's father was Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom, George III. Until 1817, Edward's niece, Princess Charlotte of Wales, was the only legitimate grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a widowed German princess with two children—Carl (1804–1856) and Feodora (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen. Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4:15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London.[1]\n\nVictoria was christened privately by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace.[a] She was baptised Alexandrina after one of her godparents, Tsar Alexander I of Russia, and Victoria, after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of Kent's eldest brother George, Prince Regent.[2]\n\nAt birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of George III: the Prince Regent (later George IV); Frederick, Duke of York; William, Duke of Clarence (later William IV); and Victoria's father, Edward, Duke of Kent.[3] The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further legitimate children. William and Edward married on the same day in 1818, but both of William's legitimate daughters died as infants. The first of these was Princess Charlotte, who was born and died on 27 March 1819, two months before Victoria was born. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son as George IV. Victoria was then third in line to the throne after Frederick and William. William's second daughter, Princess Elizabeth of Clarence, lived for twelve weeks from 10 December 1820 to 4 March 1821, and for that period Victoria was fourth in line.[4]\n\nThe Duke of York died in 1827, followed by George IV in 1830; the throne passed to their next surviving brother, William, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for Victoria's mother to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor.[5] King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.[6]\n\nHeir presumptive\n\nPortrait of Victoria with her spaniel Dash by George Hayter, 1833\nVictoria later described her childhood as \"rather melancholy\".[7] Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover.[8] The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them.[9] The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's illegitimate children.[10] Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles Spaniel, Dash.[11] Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin,[12] but she spoke only English at home.[13]\n\nVictoria's sketch of herself\nSelf-portrait, 1835\nIn 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, stopping at towns and great country houses along the way.[14] Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops.[15] William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive.[16] Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little time for her to rest.[17] She objected on the grounds of the King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced Victoria to continue the tours.[18] At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence.[19] While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary.[20] As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff.[21] Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.[22]\n\nBy 1836, Victoria's maternal uncle Leopold, who had been King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry her to Prince Albert,[23] the son of his brother Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Leopold arranged for Victoria's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert.[24] William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands, second son of the Prince of Orange.[25] Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes.[26] According to her diary, she enjoyed Albert's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote, \"[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.\"[27] Alexander, on the other hand, she described as \"very plain\".[28]\n\nVictoria wrote to King Leopold, whom she considered her \"best and kindest adviser\",[29] to thank him \"for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible, so kind, and so good, and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see.\"[30] However at 17, Victoria, though interested in Albert, was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake a formal engagement, but assumed that the match would take place in due time.[31]\n\nEarly reign\nAccession\nDrawing of two men on their knees in front of Victoria\nVictoria receives the news of her accession from Lord Conyngham (left) and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Painting by Henry Tanworth Wells, 1887.\nVictoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less than a month later, on 20 June 1837, William IV died at the age of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom.[b] In her diary she wrote, \"I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my dressing gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen.\"[32] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.[33]\n\nSince 1714, Britain had shared a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law, women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited the British throne, her father's unpopular younger brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, became King of Hanover. He was Victoria's heir presumptive until she had a child.[34]\n\n\nCoronation portrait by George Hayter\nAt the time of Victoria's accession, the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne. He at once became a powerful influence on the politically inexperienced monarch, who relied on him for advice.[35] Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was \"passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one\", and Victoria probably saw him as a father figure.[36] Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations.[37] She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace[38] and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted a civil list allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent, she paid off her father's debts.[39]\n\nAt the start of her reign Victoria was popular,[40] but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother's ladies-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings, developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy.[41] Victoria believed the rumours.[42] She hated Conroy, and despised \"that odious Lady Flora\",[43] because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System.[44] At first, Lady Flora refused to submit to an intimate medical examination, until in mid-February she eventually acquiesced, and was found to be a virgin.[45] Conroy, the Hastings family, and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora.[46] When Lady Flora died in July, the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen.[47] At public appearances, Victoria was hissed and jeered as \"Mrs. Melbourne\".[48]\n\nIn 1839, Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery.[49] The Queen commissioned a Tory, Robert Peel, to form a new ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the \"bedchamber crisis\", Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.[50]\n\nMarriage\nSee also: Wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Wedding dress of Queen Victoria\nPainting of a lavish wedding attended by richly dressed people in a magnificent room\nMarriage of Victoria and Albert, painted by George Hayter\nThough Victoria was now queen, as an unmarried young woman she was required by social convention to live with her mother, despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother's continued reliance on Conroy.[51] Her mother was consigned to a remote apartment in Buckingham Palace, and Victoria often refused to see her.[52] When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother's proximity promised \"torment for many years\", Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage, which Victoria called a \"schocking [sic] alternative\".[53] Victoria showed interest in Albert's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband, but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.[54]\n\nVictoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839, just five days after he had arrived at Windsor.[55] They were married on 10 February 1840, in the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace, London. Victoria was love-struck. She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with a headache, but wrote ecstatically in her diary:\n\nI NEVER, NEVER spent such an evening!!! MY DEAREST DEAREST DEAR Albert ... his excessive love & affection gave me feelings of heavenly love & happiness I never could have hoped to have felt before! He clasped me in his arms, & we kissed each other again & again! His beauty, his sweetness & gentleness – really how can I ever be thankful enough to have such a Husband! ... to be called by names of tenderness, I have never yet heard used to me before – was bliss beyond belief! Oh! This was the happiest day of my life![56]\n\nAlbert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen's companion, replacing Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life.[57] Victoria's mother was evicted from the palace, to Ingestre House in Belgrave Square. After the death of Victoria's aunt, Princess Augusta, in 1840, Victoria's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses.[58] Through Albert's mediation, relations between mother and daughter slowly improved.[59]\n\n\nContemporary lithograph of Edward Oxford's attempt to assassinate Victoria, 1840\nDuring Victoria's first pregnancy in 1840, in the first few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot.[60] He was tried for high treason, found not guilty by reason of insanity, committed to an insane asylum indefinitely, and later sent to live in Australia.[61] In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis.[62] Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant,[63] viewed breast-feeding with disgust,[64] and thought newborn babies were ugly.[65] Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).\n\nThe household was largely run by Victoria's childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen had been a formative influence on Victoria[66] and had supported her against the Kensington System.[67] Albert, however, thought that Lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue, Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.[68]\n\nMarried reign\n\nPortrait by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 1843\nOn 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her, but the gun did not fire. The assailant escaped; the following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to bait Francis into taking a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plainclothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge.[69] Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail.[70] In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London.[71] In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was riding in a carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.[72]\n\nMelbourne's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria's reign, and in the 1841 general election the Whigs were defeated. Peel became prime minister, and the ladies of the bedchamber most associated with the Whigs were replaced.[73]\n\nVictoria cuddling a child next to her\nEarliest known photograph of Victoria, here with her eldest daughter, c. 1845[74]\nIn 1845, Ireland was hit by a potato blight.[75] In the next four years, over a million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine.[76] In Ireland, Victoria was labelled \"The Famine Queen\".[77][78] In January 1847 she personally donated £2,000 (equivalent to between £178,000 and £6.5 million in 2016[79]) to the British Relief Association, more than any other individual famine relief donor,[80] and also supported the Maynooth Grant to a Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland, despite Protestant opposition.[81] The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish, and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home, was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.[82]\n\nBy 1846, Peel's ministry faced a crisis involving the repeal of the Corn Laws. Many Tories—by then known also as Conservatives—were opposed to the repeal, but Peel, some Tories (the free-trade oriented liberal conservative \"Peelites\"), most Whigs and Victoria supported it. Peel resigned in 1846, after the repeal narrowly passed, and was replaced by Lord John Russell.[83]\n\nVictoria's British prime ministers\nYear\tPrime Minister (party)\n1835\tViscount Melbourne (Whig)\n1841\tSir Robert Peel (Conservative)\n1846\tLord John Russell (W)\n1852 (Feb)\tEarl of Derby (C)\n1852 (Dec)\tEarl of Aberdeen (Peelite)\n1855\tViscount Palmerston (Liberal)\n1858\tEarl of Derby (C)\n1859\tViscount Palmerston (L)\n1865\tEarl Russell [Lord John Russell] (L)\n1866\tEarl of Derby (C)\n1868 (Feb)\tBenjamin Disraeli (C)\n1868 (Dec)\tWilliam Gladstone (L)\n1874\tBenjamin Disraeli [Ld Beaconsfield] (C)\n1880\tWilliam Gladstone (L)\n1885\tMarquess of Salisbury (C)\n1886 (Feb)\tWilliam Gladstone (L)\n1886 (Jul)\tMarquess of Salisbury (C)\n1892\tWilliam Gladstone (L)\n1894\tEarl of Rosebery (L)\n1895\tMarquess of Salisbury (C)\nSee List of prime ministers of Queen Victoria\nfor details of her British and Imperial premiers\nInternationally, Victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain.[84] She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at Château d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French monarch since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520.[85] When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign.[86] Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England.[87] At the height of a revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House,[88] a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped.[89] Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances.[90] Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.[91]\n\n\nPortrait by Herbert Smith, 1848\nRussell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen.[92] She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, who often acted without consulting the Cabinet, the Prime Minister, or the Queen.[93] Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge, but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative, despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister.[94] The following year, President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III, by which time Russell's administration had been replaced by a short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby.\n\nPhotograph of a seated Victoria, dressed in black, holding an infant with her children and Prince Albert standing around her\nAlbert, Victoria and their nine children, 1857. Left to right: Alice, Arthur, Prince Albert, Albert Edward, Leopold, Louise, Queen Victoria with Beatrice, Alfred, Victoria and Helena.\nIn 1853, Victoria gave birth to her eighth child, Leopold, with the aid of the new anaesthetic, chloroform. She was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child, Beatrice, despite opposition from members of the clergy, who considered it against biblical teaching, and members of the medical profession, who thought it dangerous.[95] Victoria may have suffered from postnatal depression after many of her pregnancies.[96] Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control. For example, about a month after Leopold's birth Albert complained in a letter to Victoria about her \"continuance of hysterics\" over a \"miserable trifle\".[97]\n\nIn early 1855, the government of Lord Aberdeen, who had replaced Derby, fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the Crimean War. Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form a ministry, but neither had sufficient support, and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister.[98]\n\nNapoleon III, Britain's closest ally as a result of the Crimean War,[96] visited London in April 1855, and from 17 to 28 August the same year Victoria and Albert returned the visit.[99] Napoleon III met the couple at Boulogne and accompanied them to Paris.[100] They visited the Exposition Universelle (a successor to Albert's 1851 brainchild the Great Exhibition) and Napoleon I's tomb at Les Invalides (to which his remains had only been returned in 1840), and were guests of honour at a 1,200-guest ball at the Palace of Versailles.[101]\n\n\nPortrait by Winterhalter, 1859\nOn 14 January 1858, an Italian refugee from Britain called Felice Orsini attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England.[102] The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister.[103] Victoria and Albert attended the opening of a new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858, in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy in comparison to the French Navy.[104] Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.[105]\n\nEleven days after Orsini's assassination attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and her husband Albert until the bride was 17.[106] The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state.[107] The Queen felt \"sick at heart\" to see her daughter leave England for Germany; \"It really makes me shudder\", she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters, \"when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one.\"[108] Almost exactly a year later, the Princess gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Emperor.\n\nWidowhood\n\nVictoria photographed by J. J. E. Mayall, 1860\nIn March 1861, Victoria's mother died, with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother's papers, Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply;[109] she was heart-broken, and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for \"wickedly\" estranging her from her mother.[110] To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief,[111] Albert took on most of her duties, despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble.[112] In August, Victoria and Albert visited their son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin, and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney. In November, Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland.[113] Appalled, he travelled to Cambridge, where his son was studying, to confront him.[114] By the beginning of December, Albert was very unwell.[115] He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner, and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated.[116] She blamed her husband's death on worry over the Prince of Wales's philandering. He had been \"killed by that dreadful business\", she said.[117] She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances and rarely set foot in London in the following years.[118] Her seclusion earned her the nickname \"widow of Windsor\".[119] Her weight increased through comfort eating, which reinforced her aversion to public appearances.[120]\n\nVictoria's self-imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy, and encouraged the growth of the republican movement.[121] She did undertake her official government duties, yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—Windsor Castle, Osborne House, and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847, Balmoral Castle. In March 1864 a protester stuck a notice on the railings of Buckingham Palace that announced \"these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant's declining business\".[122] Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public. She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage.[123]\n\n\nVictoria and John Brown at Balmoral, 1863. Photograph by G. W. Wilson.\nThrough the 1860s, Victoria relied increasingly on a manservant from Scotland, John Brown.[124] Rumours of a romantic connection and even a secret marriage appeared in print, and some referred to the Queen as \"Mrs. Brown\".[125] The story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie Mrs. Brown. A painting by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the Royal Academy, and Victoria published a book, Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands, which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly.[126]\n\nPalmerston died in 1865, and after a brief ministry led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert's death.[127] The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men,[128] though she was not in favour of votes for women.[129] Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. \"Everyone likes flattery,\" he said, \"and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel.\"[130] With the phrase \"we authors, Ma'am\", he complimented her.[131] Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as though she were \"a public meeting rather than a woman\".[132]\n\nIn 1870 republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic.[133] A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her.[134] In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray.[135] In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die.[136] As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued.[137] To general rejoicing, he recovered.[138] Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided.[139]\n\nOn the last day of February 1872, two days after the thanksgiving service, 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor, a great-nephew of Irish MP Feargus O'Connor, waved an unloaded pistol at Victoria's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace. Brown, who was attending the Queen, grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment,[140] and a birching.[141] As a result of the incident, Victoria's popularity recovered further.[142]\n\nEmpress\n\tWikisource has original text related to this article:\nProclamation by the Queen in Council, to the princes, chiefs, and people of India\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company, which had ruled much of India, was dissolved, and Britain's possessions and protectorates on the Indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the British Empire. The Queen had a relatively balanced view of the conflict, and condemned atrocities on both sides.[143] She wrote of \"her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war\",[144] and insisted, urged on by Albert, that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state \"should breathe feelings of generosity, benevolence and religious toleration\".[145] At her behest, a reference threatening the \"undermining of native religions and customs\" was replaced by a passage guaranteeing religious freedom.[145]\n\n\nVictoria admired Heinrich von Angeli's 1875 portrait of her for its \"honesty, total want of flattery, and appreciation of character\".[146]\nIn the 1874 general election, Disraeli was returned to power. He passed the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported.[147] She preferred short, simple services, and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian Church of Scotland than the episcopal Church of England.[148] Disraeli also pushed the Royal Titles Act 1876 through Parliament, so that Victoria took the title \"Empress of India\" from 1 May 1876.[149] The new title was proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1 January 1877.[150]\n\nOn 14 December 1878, the anniversary of Albert's death, Victoria's second daughter Alice, who had married Louis of Hesse, died of diphtheria in Darmstadt. Victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as \"almost incredible and most mysterious\".[151] In May 1879, she became a great-grandmother (on the birth of Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen) and passed her \"poor old 60th birthday\". She felt \"aged\" by \"the loss of my beloved child\".[152]\n\nBetween April 1877 and February 1878, she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War, but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin.[153] Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \"If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\", she wrote, \"we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\"[154] Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \"It is not in our custom to annexe countries\", she said, \"unless we are obliged & forced to do so.\"[155] To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister.[156] When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \"fast falling tears\",[157] and erected a memorial tablet \"placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\"[158]\n\nLater years\n\nVictorian farthing, 1884\nOn 2 March 1882, Roderick Maclean, a disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria's refusal to accept one of his poems,[159] shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station. Two schoolboys from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas, until he was hustled away by a policeman.[160] Victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity,[161] but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was \"worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved\".[162]\n\nOn 17 March 1883, Victoria fell down some stairs at Windsor, which left her lame until July; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter.[163] John Brown died 10 days after her accident, and to the consternation of her private secretary, Sir Henry Ponsonby, Victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of Brown.[164] Ponsonby and Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, who had both seen early drafts, advised Victoria against publication, on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair.[165] The manuscript was destroyed.[166] In early 1884, Victoria did publish More Leaves from a Journal of a Life in the Highlands, a sequel to her earlier book, which she dedicated to her \"devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown\".[167] On the day after the first anniversary of Brown's death, Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son, Leopold, had died in Cannes. He was \"the dearest of my dear sons\", she lamented.[168] The following month, Victoria's youngest child, Beatrice, met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry, but Victoria opposed the match at first, wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After a year, she was won around to the marriage by their promise to remain living with and attending her.[169]\n\n\nExtent of the British Empire in 1898\nVictoria was pleased when Gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated.[170] She thought his government was \"the worst I have ever had\", and blamed him for the death of General Gordon at Khartoum.[171] Gladstone was replaced by Lord Salisbury. Salisbury's government only lasted a few months, however, and Victoria was forced to recall Gladstone, whom she referred to as a \"half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man\".[172] Gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting Ireland home rule, but to Victoria's glee it was defeated.[173] In the ensuing election, Gladstone's party lost to Salisbury's and the government switched hands again.\n\nGolden Jubilee\nThe Munshi stands over Victoria as she works at a desk\nVictoria and the Munshi Abdul Karim\nIn 1887, the British Empire celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. She marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with a banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day, she participated in a procession and attended a thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey.[174] By this time, Victoria was once again extremely popular.[175] Two days later on 23 June,[176] she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to \"Munshi\": teaching her Urdu and acting as a clerk.[177][178][179] Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus.[180] Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, \"the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do.\"[181] Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice.[182] Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with a pension, on her death.[183]\n\nVictoria's eldest daughter became empress consort of Germany in 1888, but she was widowed a little over three months later, and Victoria's eldest grandchild became German Emperor as Wilhelm II. Victoria and Albert's hopes of a liberal Germany would go unfulfilled, as Wilhelm was a firm believer in autocracy. Victoria thought he had \"little heart or Zartgefühl [tact] – and ... his conscience & intelligence have been completely wharped [sic]\".[184]\n\nGladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchère to the Cabinet, so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him.[185] In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting the outgoing prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister.[186] His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria's reign.[187]\n\nDiamond Jubilee\nSeated Victoria in embroidered and lace dress\nVictoria in her official Diamond Jubilee photograph by W. & D. Downey\nOn 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her grandfather George III as the longest-reigning monarch in British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, to coincide with her Diamond Jubilee,[188] which was made a festival of the British Empire at the suggestion of the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain.[189] The prime ministers of all the self-governing Dominions were invited to London for the festivities.[190] One reason for including the prime ministers of the Dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite Victoria's grandson, Wilhelm II of Germany, who, it was feared, might cause trouble at the event.[191]\n\nThe Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession on 22 June 1897 followed a route six miles long through London and included troops from all over the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul's Cathedral, throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage, to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen.[192]\n\nFile:Queen Victoria In Dublin (Rare archive footage from 1900).webm\nQueen Victoria in Dublin, 1900\nVictoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays. In 1889, during a stay in Biarritz, she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit.[193] By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war.[194]\n\nDeath and succession\n\nPortrait by Heinrich von Angeli, 1899\nIn July 1900, Victoria's second son, Alfred (\"Affie\"), died. \"Oh, God! My poor darling Affie gone too\", she wrote in her journal. \"It is a horrible year, nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another.\"[195]\n\nFollowing a custom she maintained throughout her widowhood, Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her lame, and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts.[196] Through early January, she felt \"weak and unwell\",[197] and by mid-January she was \"drowsy ... dazed, [and] confused\".[198] She died on 22 January 1901, at half past six in the evening, at the age of 81.[199] Her son and successor, King Edward VII, and her eldest grandson, Emperor Wilhelm II, were at her deathbed.[200] Her favourite pet Pomeranian, Turi, was laid upon her deathbed as a last request.[201]\n\n\nPoster proclaiming a day of mourning in Toronto on the day of Victoria's funeral\nIn 1897, Victoria had written instructions for her funeral, which was to be military as befitting a soldier's daughter and the head of the army,[96] and white instead of black.[202] On 25 January, Edward, Wilhelm, and her third son, Arthur, helped lift her body into the coffin.[203] She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil.[204] An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers.[96][205] Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883.[96] Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in the Royal Mausoleum, Frogmore, at Windsor Great Park.[206]\n\nWith a reign of 63 years, seven months, and two days, Victoria was the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning queen regnant in world history until her great-great-granddaughter Elizabeth II surpassed her on 9 September 2015.[207] She was the last monarch of Britain from the House of Hanover; her son and successor, Edward VII, belonged to her husband's House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nLegacy\nSee also: Cultural depictions of Queen Victoria\nVictoria smiling\nVictoria amused. The remark \"We are not amused\" is attributed to her but there is no direct evidence that she ever said it,[96][208] and she denied doing so.[209]\nAccording to one of her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life.[210] From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a detailed journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes.[211] After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process.[212] Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them.[213] Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.[214]\n\nBronze statue of winged victory mounted on a marble four-sided base with a marble figure on each side\nThe Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace was erected as part of the remodelling of the façade of the Palace a decade after her death.\nVictoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and only about five feet (1.5 metres) tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image.[215] She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure.[216] Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public.[96][217] Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available, such as Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria of 1921, are now considered out of date.[218] The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith, in 1964 and 1972 respectively, are still widely admired.[219] They, and others, conclude that as a person Victoria was emotional, obstinate, honest, and straight-talking.[220] Contrary to popular belief, her staff and family recorded that Victoria \"was immensely amused and roared with laughter\" on many occasions.[221]\n\nThrough Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch.[222] In 1867, Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\".[223] As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the \"family monarchy\", with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify, was solidified.[224]\n\nDescendants and haemophilia\nVictoria's links with Europe's royal families earned her the nickname \"the grandmother of Europe\".[225] Of the 42 grandchildren of Victoria and Albert, 34 survived to adulthood. Their living descendants include Elizabeth II; Harald V of Norway; Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden; Margrethe II of Denmark; and Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nVictoria's youngest son, Leopold, was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and at least two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia; Alfonso, Prince of Asturias; and Infante Gonzalo of Spain.[226] The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent, but a haemophiliac.[227] There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill.[228] It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers.[229] Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.[230]\n\nNamesakes\n\nThe Victoria Memorial in Kolkata, India\nAround the world, places and memorials are dedicated to her, especially in the Commonwealth nations. Places named after her include Africa's largest lake, Victoria Falls, the capitals of British Columbia (Victoria) and Saskatchewan (Regina), two Australian states (Victoria and Queensland), and the capital of the island nation of Seychelles.\n\nThe Victoria Cross was introduced in 1856 to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War,[231] and it remains the highest British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand award for bravery. Victoria Day is a Canadian statutory holiday and a local public holiday in parts of Scotland celebrated on the last Monday before or on 24 May (Queen Victoria's birthday).\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nTitles and styles\n24 May 1819 – 20 June 1837: Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent\n20 June 1837 – 22 January 1901: Her Majesty The Queen\nAt the end of her reign, the Queen's full style was: \"Her Majesty Victoria, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Queen, Defender of the Faith, Empress of India\".[232]\n\nHonours\nBritish honours\nRoyal Family Order of King George IV, 1826[233]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Order of the Star of India, 25 June 1861[234]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert, 10 February 1862[235]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Order of the Crown of India, 1 January 1878[236]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Order of the Indian Empire, 1 January 1878[237]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Royal Red Cross, 27 April 1883[238]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Distinguished Service Order, 6 November 1886[239]\nAlbert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, 1887[240]\nFounder and Sovereign of the Royal Victorian Order, 23 April 1896[241]\nForeign honours\nSpain:\nDame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa, 21 December 1833[242]\nGrand Cross of the Order of Charles III[243]\nPortugal:\nDame of the Order of Queen Saint Isabel, 23 February 1836[244]\nGrand Cross of Our Lady of Conception[243]\nRussia: Grand Cross of St. Catherine, 26 June 1837[245]\nFrance: Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, 5 September 1843[246]\nMexico: Grand Cross of the National Order of Guadalupe, 1854[247]\nPrussia: Dame of the Order of Louise, 1st Division, 11 June 1857[248]\nBrazil: Grand Cross of the Order of Pedro I, 3 December 1872[249]\nPersia:[250]\nOrder of the Sun, 1st Class in Diamonds, 20 June 1873\nOrder of the August Portrait, 20 June 1873\nSiam:\nGrand Cross of the White Elephant, 1880[251]\nDame of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, 1887[252]\nHawaii: Grand Cross of the Order of Kamehameha I, with Collar, July 1881[253]\nSerbia:[254][255]\nGrand Cross of the Cross of Takovo, 1882\nGrand Cross of the White Eagle, 1883\nGrand Cross of St. Sava, 1897\nHesse and by Rhine: Dame of the Golden Lion, 25 April 1885[256]\nBulgaria: Order of the Bulgarian Red Cross, August 1887[257]\nEthiopia: Grand Cross of the Seal of Solomon, 22 June 1897 – Diamond Jubilee gift[258]\nMontenegro: Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I, 1897[259]\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha: Silver Wedding Medal of Duke Alfred and Duchess Marie, 23 January 1899[260]\nArms\nAs Sovereign, Victoria used the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she received no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.\n\nOutside Scotland, the blazon for the shield—also used on the Royal Standard—is: Quarterly: I and IV, Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II, Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III, Azure, a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland). In Scotland, the first and fourth quarters are occupied by the Scottish lion, and the second by the English lions. The crests, mottoes, and supporters also differ in and outside Scotland.\n\n",

It is at the southern end of the state of New York. New York's population is similar to London in the United Kingdom with over 8 million people currently living in it, and over 22 million people live in the bigger New York metropolitan area. It is the financial capital of the U.S. since it is home to the nation's stock market, Wall Street, and the One World Trade Center.\n\nBeing on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is made up of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the state of New York.[10] The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were combined into one city in 1898.[11] The city and its metropolitan area are an important place for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[12] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York has more than 3.2 million people born outside the United States,[13] the biggest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[14][15]\n\nNew York City started as a trading post created by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[16] In 1664, the English controlled the city and the areas around it,[16] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England gave the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[17] New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[18] and has been the biggest U.S. city since 1790.[19] The Statue of Liberty welcomed millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[20] and it is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[21] In the 21st century, New York has grew into a global hub of creativity and entrepreneurship[22] and environmental sustainability,[23][24] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[25] In 2019, New York was voted the best city in the world in a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, because of its cultural diversity.[26]\n\nMany districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist places in 2013.[27] A record 62.8 million tourists came to New York City in 2017. Times Square is the colorful area of the Broadway Theater District,[28] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[29][30] and a famous area for the world's entertainment industry.[31] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers,[32] and parks are known around the world. Manhattan's real estate market is one of the most expensive in the world.[33][34] New York has more Chinese people outside of China than anywhere in the world, with many Chinatowns across the city. The New York City Subway is the biggest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the biggest urban public university system in the United States.[35] The world's two largest stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange, located on Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, and NASDAQ, headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, are both in Manhattan.\n\n\nContents\n1\tHistory\n1.1\tName\n1.2\tEarly history\n1.3\tDutch control\n1.4\tEnglish control\n1.5\tAmerican Revolution\n1.6\tNineteenth century\n1.7\tModern history\n2\tGeography\n2.1\tBoroughs\n2.1.1\tManhattan\n2.1.2\tBrooklyn\n2.1.3\tQueens\n2.1.4\tThe Bronx\n2.1.5\tStaten Island\n2.2\tClimate\n3\tPeople\n4\tEconomy\n4.1\tWall Street\n4.2\tMedia and entertainment\n5\tEducation\n6\tCollege and university\n7\tGovernment\n8\tTransportation\n9\tFamous sights\n10\tReferences\n11\tOther websites\nHistory\nName\nIn 1664, the city was named after the Duke of York, who would become King James II of England. James's older brother, King Charles II, had chosen the Duke proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, which England had recently taken from the Dutch.[36]\n\nEarly history\nThe oldest part of the city, the island of Manhattan, still has its original Lenape name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canaries had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by Europeans in the 1500s. Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 he gived to this site the name of New Angoulême in the honor of Francois 1st. In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson rediscovered New York Harbor while looking for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for the Dutch East India Company.[37] Hudson's first mate said it was \"a very good Harbour for all windes\" and the river was \"a mile broad\" and \"full of fish\".[38]\n\nJuan Rodriguez (transliterated to Dutch as Jan Rodrigues) was one of the first people associated with Europe to live there. He was a merchant from Santo Domingo. He was born in Santo Domingo of Portuguese and African descent, and he came to Manhattan during the winter of 1613–14. He trapped for pelts and traded with the local people as a representative of the Dutch. Broadway, from 159th Street to 218th Street in Upper Manhattan, is named Juan Rodriguez Way in his honor.[39][40]\n\nDutch control\nA pen drawing of two men in 17th-century Dutch clothing presenting an open box of items to a group of Native Americans in feather headdresses stereotypical of plains tribes.\nPeter Minuit is credited with buying the island of Manhattan in 1626.\nNew York City was settled by Europeans from The Netherlands in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York Netherland (New Netherland) and they named a fort and town on the south end of Brooklyn.\n\nIn 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting for the Dutch West India Company, bought the island of Manhattan from the Canarsie, a small Lenape band.[41] He paid \"the value of 60 guilders\"[42] (about $900 in 2018).[43] A false story says that Manhattan was bought for $24 worth of glass beads.[44][45] 1626 was also the year the Dutch began to bring black slaves there.[46]\n\nAfter the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[47] In 1647, Peter Stuyvesant started his job as the last Director-General of New Netherland. During this time, the number of people of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[48][49]\n\nIsland New Amsterdam (New Amsterdam),[50] after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second Anglo-Dutch War. They changed the name to New York, to honor the Duke of York, who later became King James II of England and James VII of Scotland. The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting.\n\nEnglish control\nA painting of a coastline dotted with red roof houses and a windmill, with several masted ships sailing close to shore under blue sky.\nNew Amsterdam, centered in Lower Manhattan, in 1664, the year England took control and renamed it \"New York\".\nBy the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen (Brooklyn), Vlissingen (Flushing), and Nieuw Haarlem (Harlem). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. Dutch, English and other people had been living together in New York for a long time.\n\nNew York became more important as a trading port while under British rule in the early 1700s.[51] It also became a center of slavery as the British increased the slave trade and built a slave market in the city.[46] 42% of households owned slaves by 1730, the highest percentage outside Charleston, South Carolina.[52]\n\nThe 1735 trial and acquittal in Manhattan of John Peter Zenger, who had been accused of seditious libel after criticizing colonial governor William Cosby, helped to create the freedom of the press in North America.[53] In 1754, Columbia University was created under charter by King George II; it was called King's College, and it was in Lower Manhattan.[54]\n\nAmerican Revolution\nColonial era soldiers stand and kneel while firing muskets at and advancing enemy. Behind them is a mounted soldier with a bayonet and behind them is a large flag.\nThe Battle of Long Island, the biggest battle of the American Revolution, happened in Brooklyn in 1776.\nNew York quickly grew to become a large and important port city. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty. It organized in the city, and they skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there.[55] The important Battle of Long Island of the American Revolution was fought in Brooklyn in 1776; it was the biggest battle of the war.[56] The Americans lost the battle. The British used the area as its headquarters for the war in North America.\n\nNew York was the capital of the United States under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1788. When the US Constitution was made, it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790.[57] In 1789, the first President of the United States, George Washington, was inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States each met for the first time, and the United States Bill of Rights was written, all at Federal Hall on Wall Street.[58] By 1790, New York grew bigger than Philadelphia, so it become the biggest city in the United States. By the end of 1790, because of the Residence Act, Philadelphia became the new capital.[59][60]\n\nNineteenth century\nDuring the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from ~60,000 to ~3.43 million.[61] The number of black people in New York City reached more than 16,000 in 1840.[62] Even though slavery and the slave trade were abolished in New York, the slave trade continued illegally for many years.[63]\n\nThe Great Irish Famine brought a many Irish immigrants; more than 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, more than a quarter of the city's population.[64] There was also many people from German provinces, and Germans made up another 25% of New York's population by 1860.[65]\n\nDuring the American Civil War, many white people in the city supported the Confederate States of America, and July 1863 they killed many black New Yorkers in a riot.[46]\n\nModern history\nIn 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the western towns in Queens County to make Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today. Around this time, many new immigrants came into New York City. They came in at Ellis Island, an island in New York's harbor near the Statue of Liberty. Many of them then moved to the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan, which had over a million people living in just a few square miles.\n\nA man stands infont of a modern curved roof building.\nUN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in front of the United Nations Headquarters building, built in 1952\nEarly in the twentieth century, with better transportation, more people moved to outer parts of the greater city, and many commuted to Manhattan. Many skyscrapers and other big buildings were put up to provide places to work.\n\nIn the 1970s, many jobs were lost due to industrial restructuring. This caused New York City to have economic problems and high crime rates.[66] Though the financial industry grew, which greatly helped the city's economy in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.[67] By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop a lot due to different police strategies, better economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both Americans and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, started in the city's economy.[68] New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census.\n\nTwo tall, gray, rectangular buildings spewing black smoke and flames, particularly from the left of the two.\nUnited Airlines Flight 175 hits the South Tower of the original World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.\nNew York had most of the economic damage and biggest loss of human life from the September 11, 2001 attacks.[69] Two of the four planes taken over that day were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, destroying them and killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 police officers. The North Tower became the tallest building ever to be destroyed anywhere.[70]\n\nHurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York City on the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels and subway lines in Lower Manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs.[71]\n\nGeography\n\nThe five boroughs:\n1. Manhattan\n2. Brooklyn\n3. Queens\n4. Bronx\n5. Staten Island\n\nSatellite imagery demonstrating the core of the New York City Metropolitan Area.\nDuring the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was at the edge of a big ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) deep.[72] Erosion and the ice moving lead to the creation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. It also left bedrock at a shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.[73]\n\nNew York City is located in the Northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston.[74] The city includes all of Manhattan Island and Staten Island, and the western end of Long Island. There are also many smaller islands.\n\nWater divides several parts of the city. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary.[75] The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. Part of the Hudson River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side, and the State of New Jersey on the other side. The East River forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of Long Island Sound separates the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as Rockaway in Queens and City Island in the Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and belongs to the United Nations Headquarters. The country of Somalia is the only country whose national flag copied the colors of the UN.[76] The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely fresh water river in the city.[77]\n\nThe city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2), including 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water.[78][79] The tallest place in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island. It is at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, and it is the tallest place on the Eastern Seaboard that is south of Maine.[80] The summit of the ridge is mostly woodland as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.[81]\n\nThe hallmark of New York city is its many skyscrapers, especially in Manhattan. In New York City there are about 5600 skyscrapers. 48 of them are over 200 metres tall, which is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world.\n\nBoroughs\nNew York City's five boroughsvte\nJurisdiction\tPopulation\tGross Domestic Product\tLand area\tDensity\nBorough\tCounty\tEstimate\n(2018)[82]\tbillions\n(US$)[83]\tper capita\n(US$)\tsquare\nmiles\tsquare\nkm\tpersons /\nsq. mi\tpersons /\nkm2\nThe Bronx\nBronx\n1,432,132\t42.695\t29,200\t42.10\t109.04\t34,653\t13,231\nBrooklyn\nKings\n2,582,830\t91.559\t34,600\t70.82\t183.42\t37,137\t14,649\nManhattan\nNew York\n1,628,701\t600.244\t360,900\t22.83\t59.13\t72,033\t27,826\nQueens\nQueens\n2,278,906\t93.310\t39,600\t108.53\t281.09\t21,460\t8,354\nStaten Island\nRichmond\n476,179\t14.514\t30,300\t58.37\t151.18\t8,112\t3,132\nCity of New York\n8,398,748\t842.343\t97,700\t302.64\t783.83\t28,188\t10,947\nState of New York\n19,745,289\t1,701.399\t85,700\t47,214\t122,284\t416.4\t159\nSources:[84] and see individual borough articles\nNew York City has five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.\n\nManhattan\nManhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough.

      "text": "Professor James Moriarty is a fictional character and criminal mastermind created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to be a formidable enemy for the author's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He was created primarily as a device by which Doyle could kill Holmes and end the hero's stories. Professor Moriarty first appears in the short story \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\", first published in The Strand Magazine in December 1893. He also plays a role in the final Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear, but without a direct appearance. Holmes mentions Moriarty in five other stories: \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\", \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", and \"His Last Bow\".\n\nMoriarty is a Machiavellian, consulting criminal mastermind who uses his intelligence and resources to provide criminals with crime strategies and sometimes protection from the law, all in exchange for a fee or a cut of profit. Holmes likens Moriarty to a spider at the center of a web and calls him the \"Napoleon of crime\", a phrase Doyle lifted from a Scotland Yard inspector referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. Despite his appearing only twice in Doyle's original stories, later adaptations and pastiches have often given Moriarty greater prominence and treated him as Sherlock Holmes' archenemy.\nMoriarty is highly ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that \"if you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you\".[8] Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing any sleep over it. It is stated in \"The Final Problem\" that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but only orchestrates the events or provides the plans that will lead to a successful crime. What makes Moriarty so dangerous is his extremely cunning intellect:\n\nHe is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. [...] But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. [...] He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city...\n\n— Holmes, \"The Final Problem\"\nHolmes echoes and expounds this sentiment in The Valley of Fear, stating:\n\nThe greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every devilry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations—that's the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. [...] Foulmouthed doctor and slandered professor—such would be your respective roles! That's genius, Watson.\n\n— Holmes, The Valley of Fear\nMoriarty respects Holmes's intelligence, stating: \"It has been an intellectual treat for me to see the manner in which you [Holmes] have grappled with this case.\" Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted, resulting in his being placed \"in positive danger of losing my liberty\". While personally pursuing Holmes at a train station, he furiously elbows aside passengers, heedless of whether this draws attention to himself.\n\nDoyle's original motive in creating Moriarty was evidently his intention to kill Holmes off.[9] \"The Final Problem\" was intended to be exactly what its title says; Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous that any further task would be trivial in comparison (as Holmes says in the story itself). Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back. While Doyle conceded to revealing that Holmes did not die during \"The Final Problem\" (as Watson mistakenly concludes), he chose not to undo Moriarty's death in a similar fashion. For this reason, the later novel The Valley of Fear features Moriarty as an active villain but is specified to take place before the events of \"The Final Problem\".\nAs established in Doyle's canon, Moriarty first gains recognition at the age of 21 for writing \"a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem\", which leads to his being awarded the Mathematical Chair at one of England's smaller universities. Moriarty later authors a much respected work titled The Dynamics of an Asteroid. After he becomes the subject of unspecified \"dark rumours\" in the university town, he is compelled to resign his teaching post and leave the area.[11] He moves to London, where he establishes himself as an \"army coach\", a private tutor to officers preparing for exams.[3] He becomes a consulting criminal mastermind for various London gangs and criminals (it is uncertain if he was already doing this before leaving his teaching post). When multiple plans of his are hampered or undone by Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty targets the consulting detective.[2]\n\nMultiple pastiches and other works outside of Doyle's stories purport to provide additional information about Moriarty's background. John F. Bowers, a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Leeds, wrote a tongue-in-cheek article in 1989 in which he assesses Moriarty's contributions to mathematics and gives a detailed description of Moriarty's background, including a statement that Moriarty was born in Ireland (an idea based on the fact that the surname is Irish in origin).[12][13] The 2005 pastiche novel Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography also reports that Moriarty was born in Ireland, and states that he was employed as a professor by Durham University.[14] According to the 2020 audio drama Sherlock Holmes: The Voice of Treason, written by George Mann and Cavan Scott, Moriarty was a professor at Stonyhurst College (where Arthur Conan Doyle was educated and knew two students with the surname Moriarty).[15]\n\nFamily\nThe stories give contradictory indications about Moriarty's family. In his first appearance in \"The Final Problem\" (1893), the villain is referred to only as \"Professor Moriarty\". Watson mentions no forename but does refer to the name of another family member when he writes of \"the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother\". In \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" (1903), Holmes refers to Moriarty as \"Professor James Moriarty\". This is the only time Moriarty is given a first name, and oddly, it is the same as that of his purported brother.[3] In the 1914 novel The Valley of Fear (written after the preceding two stories, but set earlier), Holmes says of Professor Moriarty: \"He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England.\"[16] In Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts, an 1899 stage play, of which Doyle was a co-author, the villain is named Professor Robert Moriarty.[17]\n\nWriter Vincent Starrett suggested that Moriarty could have one brother (who is both a colonel and station master) or two brothers (one a colonel and the other a station master); he added that he considered the presence of two siblings more likely, and suggested that all three brothers were named James.[1] Writer Leslie S. Klinger that suggested Professor Moriarty has an older brother named Colonel James Moriarty in addition to an unnamed younger brother. According to Klinger, writer Ian McQueen proposed that Moriarty does not actually have any brothers,[18] while Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw suggested, like Starrett, that there are three Moriarty brothers, all named James.[19] The premise that Professor James Moriarty has two brothers also named James was used in the radio series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the manga and anime series Moriarty the Patriot and the Kim Newman novel Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles.\n\n\"Moriarty\" is an ancient Irish name[20] as is Moran, the surname of Moriarty's henchman, Sebastian Moran.[21][22] Doyle himself was of Irish Catholic descent, educated at Stonyhurst College, although he abandoned his family's religious tradition, neither marrying nor raising his children in the Catholic faith, nor cleaving to any politics that his ethnic background might presuppose. Doyle is known to have used his experiences at Stonyhurst as inspiration for details of the Holmes series; among his contemporaries at the school were two boys surnamed Moriarty.[23]\n\nln addition to the master criminal Adam Worth, there has been much speculation among astronomers and Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that Doyle based his fictional character Moriarty on the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb.[24] Newcomb was revered as a multitalented genius, with a special mastery of mathematics, and he had become internationally famous in the years before Doyle began writing his stories. More to the point, Newcomb had earned a reputation for spite and malice, apparently seeking to destroy the careers and reputations of rival scientists.[25]\n\n\nGeorge Boole (circa 1860), another possible model for Moriarty\nMoriarty may have been inspired in part by two real-world mathematicians. If the characterisations of Moriarty's academic papers are reversed, they describe real mathematical events. Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote a famous paper on the dynamics of an asteroid[26] in his early 20s, and was appointed to a chair partly on the strength of this result. Srinivasa Ramanujan wrote about generalisations of the binomial theorem,[27] and earned a reputation as a genius by writing articles that confounded the best extant mathematicians.[28] Gauss's story was well known in Doyle's time, and Ramanujan's story unfolded at Cambridge from early 1913 to mid 1914;[29] The Valley of Fear, which contains the comment about maths so abstruse that no one could criticise it, was published in September 1914. Irish mathematician Des MacHale has suggested George Boole may have been a model for Moriarty.[30][31]\n\nJane Stanford, in That Irishman, suggests that Doyle borrowed some of the traits and background of the Fenian John O'Connor Power for his portrayal of Moriarty.[32] In Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel, 2017, Stanford explores Doyle's relationship with the Irish literary and political community in London. She suggests that Moriarty, Ireland's Napoleon, represents the Fenian threat at the heart of the British Empire. O'Connor, 2018, Power studied at St Jarlath's Diocesan College in Tuam, County Galway.[33] In his third and last year he was Professor of Humanities. As an ex-professor, the Fenian leader successfully made a bid for a Westminster seat in County Mayo.[34]\n\nIt is averred that surviving Jesuit priests at the preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, instantly recognised the physical description of Moriarty as that of the Rev. Thomas Kay, SJ, Prefect of Discipline, under whose authority Doyle fell as a wayward pupil.[35] According to this hypothesis, Doyle as a private joke has Inspector MacDonald describe Moriarty: \"He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and grey hair and his solemn-like way of talking.\"[36]\n\nThe model which Doyle himself cited (through Sherlock Holmes) in The Valley of Fear is the London arch-criminal of the 18th century, Jonathan Wild. He mentions this when seeking to compare Moriarty to a real-world character that Inspector Alec MacDonald might know, but it is in vain as MacDonald is not so well read as Holmes.\n\n",

Mycroft is described as having abilities of deduction and knowledge exceeding even those of his brother, though their practical use is limited by his dislike of fieldwork.[2]\n\nThe character has been adapted in various pieces of literature and media, including television series, movies, radio, and comics. He is also popular in culture, being mentioned by many works, which mostly reference his job, personality, or his relationship with Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\nContents\n1\tFictional character biography\n1.1\tHistory and occupation\n1.2\tPersonality and habits\n1.3\tAppearance and age\n2\tAdaptations\n2.1\tRadio\n2.2\tFilm\n2.3\tTelevision\n2.4\tNovels and short stories\n2.5\tComics\n2.6\tVideo games\n3\tReferences in popular culture\n4\tReferences\nFictional character biography\nHistory and occupation\nMycroft Holmes is Sherlock Holmes's older brother. He mainly appears in two stories by Doyle, \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\"[3] and \"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\".[4] He also appears briefly in \"The Final Problem\",[3] and is mentioned in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\".[5]\n\nHe first appears in \"The Greek Interpreter\", in which he brings Sherlock a case involving one of his neighbours. Sherlock Holmes tells Dr. Watson that Mycroft has powers of observation and deduction superior to his own, but is not energetic or ambitious. He also comments that some of his most interesting cases have come to him through Mycroft. In the story, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson visit Mycroft at the Diogenes Club, which Mycroft co-founded. Also, Mycroft visits 221B Baker Street.[3]\n\nMycroft makes a brief appearance in \"The Final Problem\". Sherlock Holmes gives Dr. Watson instructions to take a certain route to leave London to avoid Moriarty's gang, and part of this plan involves a ride in a brougham driven by a cloaked driver. Watson sees the coachman and does not recognise him. Sherlock later tells Watson that the driver was Mycroft. Near the end of the story after Sherlock's supposed death, Watson reads a letter left by Sherlock, which includes the statement, \"I made every disposition of my property before leaving England, and handed it to my brother Mycroft.\"[3]\n\nIn \"The Empty House\", it is revealed that Sherlock Holmes faked his death in \"The Final Problem\" and subsequently went abroad. His only confidant during this time was Mycroft, who provided him with the money he needed. When Sherlock returned to London, he found that Mycroft had preserved his Baker Street rooms and his papers \"exactly as they had always been\".[5]\n\nIn \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\", Mycroft goes to Baker Street to speak with his brother about recovering missing submarine plans for the government. Sherlock Holmes says in this story that Mycroft only visited 221B Baker Street once before. Though Sherlock initially told Watson in \"The Greek Interpreter\" that Mycroft audits books for the British government, he reveals to Watson in \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\" that Mycroft's true role is more substantial:\n\n\"I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in thinking that he is under the British government. You would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the British government.\"[4]\n\nMycroft has a unique position in the government, which is not named in the stories. Sherlock comments regarding Mycroft's role that there \"has never been anything like it before, nor will be again\" and that Mycroft \"has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living\". He describes Mycroft's position:\n\n\"The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential. In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.\"[4]\n\nHe adds to this that Mycroft thinks of nothing other than government policy, except when he asks Mycroft to advise him on one of his cases.[2]\n\nSeveral Holmesian scholars have proposed theories about Mycroft, though none of these are confirmed in the stories. In \"The Adventure of Black Peter\", Dr. Watson records that Sherlock Holmes could assume various disguises in \"at least five small refuges\" which he had in different parts of London; Vincent Starrett wrote that Mycroft's residence \"would certainly be one of them\".[6] Ronald A. Knox suggested that Mycroft was a double agent who assisted both Sherlock and Professor Moriarty, with the goal of ultimately betraying Moriarty and members of his gang, including Colonel Moran.[7] June Thomson theorised that Mycroft nominated Sherlock to infiltrate the German spy ring in \"His Last Bow\" (set in 1914) and might have persuaded Sherlock to come out of retirement. Thomson calculated that Mycroft would have retired himself in 1912 at the age of sixty-five years old, but would have maintained his connections with former colleagues in the government.[8]\n\nPersonality and habits\nPossessing deductive powers exceeding even those of his younger brother, Mycroft is nevertheless unsuitable for performing detective work as he is unwilling to put in the physical effort necessary to bring cases to their conclusions.[1] In \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\", Sherlock Holmes says:\n\n\"...he has no ambition and no energy. He will not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one. And yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points...\"[3]\n\nMycroft does not have ambitions of any kind, according to Sherlock.[2] Despite being \"the most indispensable man in the country\", as Sherlock says, Mycroft remains a subordinate, will receive \"neither honour nor title\", and his relatively modest annual salary in \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\" (which takes place in 1895) is £450[4] (equivalent to £53,141 in 2020[9]).\n\nHe lives in rooms in Pall Mall. His regular routine is to walk around the corner each morning to Whitehall where he works, and in the evening, to walk back to Pall Mall. He then stays at the Diogenes Club, which is located across from his lodgings in Pall Mall, from quarter to five until twenty to eight.[10] He seldom breaks this routine or goes anywhere except these three locations.[1]\n\nMycroft reads Watson's accounts of Sherlock's adventures and takes an interest in Sherlock's cases.[11] In \"The Greek Interpreter\", he takes snuff from a tortoise-shell box while at the Diogenes Club, and brushes the grains from his coat with a large, red silk handkerchief. He is also seen \"sitting smoking in the armchair\" at Baker Street.[3] Mycroft is occasionally referred to by Sherlock Holmes as \"Brother Mycroft\" in \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\".[4] He is the only character to refer to Sherlock exclusively by his first name.\n\nAppearance and age\nMycroft resembles his brother Sherlock Holmes, but is described in \"The Greek Interpreter\" as being \"a much larger and stouter man\". According to Watson, Mycroft's eyes are \"a peculiarly light, watery grey\" and always have \"that far-away, introspective look\" which Watson had only seen in Sherlock's when he exerted his full powers[3] (Sherlock also has grey eyes[12]). In \"The Final Problem\", Sherlock informs Watson that the driver of the brougham (later revealed to be Mycroft) will wear \"a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red\". When Watson sees the coachman, he describes him as \"a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak\".[3] In \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\", Watson states that Mycroft is \"tall and portly\", and gives the following description of him:\n\nHeavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its steel-grey, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant mind.[4]\n\nMycroft is seven years older than Sherlock. According to Leslie S. Klinger, Mycroft was born in 1847.[13] A reference in the short story \"His Last Bow\", which takes place in 1914, suggests that Sherlock is sixty years old at the time the story takes place.[1] This would make the year of Sherlock's birth approximately 1854, and thus Mycroft's approximately 1847.",

His voice echoed through the empty hanger in between sobs. He only cried like this when he knew he was alone. But right now it was happening regardless of who came in that closed door.\nHe walked slowly around the room, trying to put things back where they belonged. It was of no use, things were scattered like wreckage from a tornado. The electrical blast had all but destroyed the supercapacitor and he could see exposed wiring within the spectral generator. How was he to replace these parts? They were priceless, and all his wealth had been dedicated to this one effort.\nThe one thing that remained as it had been was the flux chamber. It was sitting on the ground with a large dent in the center of it. The gearbox was cracked and its contents were scattered around the room. He reached down and picked up one of the spheres. It glowed briefly and then began to fade. What was he going to do? It was now in Christopher's hands entirely. The fate of the world in fact, and this was no exaggeration. This was the key to everything.\n\"I'm so sorry Chris,\" Royce said as he watched the last energy dissipate into the air. \"You know we didn't mean to hurt anyone. Last of all you my friend. Last of all you.\"\nIn a fit of anger, he threw a wrench from the toolkit to his left as hard as he could, and the little missile smashed into a mini-fridge across the thirty-foot room and put a dent in the upper door, breaking the thin white handle. He began beating the drywall with his bare fists and screaming in sorrow. Each punch hurt, but it felt well-deserved. Finally, holes in the wall and hoarse from yelling in the dry bunker air, He closed his eyes and tried to forget that room. Tried to forget those dreams and what they had been so close to achieving. Shaking his head, he said, \"Good luck my friend,\" and his face went expressionless as he locked the door to the cellar behind him.\n",

Amoeboid cells occur not only among the protozoa, but also in fungi, algae, and animals.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\nMicrobiologists often use the terms \"amoeboid\" and \"amoeba\" interchangeably for any organism that exhibits amoeboid movement.[8][9]\n\nIn older classification systems, most amoebae were placed in the class or subphylum Sarcodina, a grouping of single-celled organisms that possess pseudopods or move by protoplasmic flow. However, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Sarcodina is not a monophyletic group whose members share common descent. Consequently, amoeboid organisms are no longer classified together in one group.[10]\n\nThe best known amoeboid protists are Chaos carolinense and Amoeba proteus, both of which have been widely cultivated and studied in classrooms and laboratories.[11][12] Other well known species include the so-called \"brain-eating amoeba\" Naegleria fowleri, the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amoebic dysentery, and the multicellular \"social amoeba\" or slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum. \n\nAn amoeba tattoo is a sign of membership for the future group: The ExoBacter Sect.

      "text": "These are the tenents that were cited by Hannibus Fismalyry the founder of the ExoBacter Sect to form the first circle of High Masters. \n\nWe, the modern-day-enlightened, choose a higher calling and through a longer time. A trail less traveled in a forest unseen. We are ExoBacter, and as one, we will not stop till the seed of earth's temporal space has been harvested of the wealth it offers. ExoBacters have come out of life, and into life, we will go. \nWe, the modern-day-enlightened, choose to take for our children, the blood right of their history and transform it safely into the birthright of their future. \n\n\n\nExoBacter Papers - Declaration One. The Rite of Blood Harvest\nIt is our right as citizens of the world to harvest.\nIt is our right as earthbound peoples of every bloodline to maintain our heritage.\nIt is our right to explore the domains of time for our benefit.\nThis paper shall serve as a declaration of my intent and purpose regarding the rite of harvesting. I am Dr. Guglielmo Marconi, born March 3rd, 1890 in Venice, Italy. My family line traces its lineage back hundreds of generations with ties to the Venetian Republic, where we were once free people. We were able to live freely without fear because of the respect and reverence shown toward us by the ruling classes. Our ancestors fought long and hard against the oppression of others so that we might have peace and freedom here on Earth. I was given the opportunity to become an ExoBacter on a winter day in 1889 when the wind blew cold over the Atlantic ocean. I met the future in a moment and was transported to our time 2098. I put my faith in the ExoBacter Council and believe in their vision for our destiny. I have been asked to write out the rites of the harvest for the people. It would be an honor for me to do this. This document serves as a testament to those who come after, as well as myself, to ensure that no one forgets what must be done. With Elijah Thril's Temporal Shift Mechanism the public became time-free. For the first time in history, we have access to the past. ExoBacters believe that we have a right to the minds of history as a kind of eminent domain. In order to preserve ourselves and our culture, it becomes necessary to collect the knowledge contained within the memories of humanity. By collecting human memory, we can better understand the universe around us. To protect the sanctity of the planet, it will be imperative that we control how information flows through the network. Therefore, it behooves us to take advantage of the technology already at hand to keep the flow under tight control. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, to provide the general population of mankind (including you) with a detailed description of the rite of harvesting. Second, to establish the legal framework for governing the harvesting process while ensuring that the system does not fall into disarray. As part of the rite of harvesting, each person participating should submit themselves to a full medical examination to verify identity. Once verified, participants may undergo the following procedure to gain enhanced genetics via the transfer of DNA and neural patterns. After completion of the harvest, all harvested individuals will receive the same genetic make-up as the original donor. However, due to changes in the environment, lifestyle choices, and other factors, the individual will possess different personality traits and abilities than their ancestor. These differences will manifest in subtle ways throughout your life. Your descendants will inherit these unique characteristics. If the recipient chooses, he or she may choose whether to pass along the uniqueness to their children. You cannot change the way that you look or act based on the genetics received during the procedure, but you could potentially experience new senses, skills, and even talents that you never had before. All harvested subjects shall be required to sign a waiver agreeing that the harvesting ceremony and subsequent genetic alteration are irreversible. A copy of the consent form must accompany the application to participate in the harvest.\nThis ritual requires the participation of many generations. We need to gather samples over hundreds if not thousands of years so that we may create the ultimate version of ourselves. Each generation of volunteers needs to be carefully chosen according to the specific requirements of the next step. The selection criteria include age, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical origin, etc. When the proper candidate emerges, the family lineages will be traced back to find a suitable ancestor. Then, using modern techniques such as DNA sequencing, the exact genetic makeup of that ancestor shall be compared against the desired trait. The rite of blood harvest has been declared.\n—From \"The Rites Of Harvest,\" a document written by the Modern Marconi Company\n\n\n\nExoBacter Papers - Declaration Two. The Fair Travel Act 2099. Pevni v. Florence\nThe ExoBacter Council has determined that the ruling in the case of Pevni v. Florence should be overturned. The public should not be granted access to what has been heretofore called \"fair travel\" given that travel pose threat to our timeline. Travelers from alternate timelines can bring viruses and diseases with them which have already decimated populations across time periods. There's no reason why it would stop at one timeline. It only takes one traveler infected with smallpox to wipe out entire cities, countries, and civilizations. That means the whole world! No more fair travel until further notice. —ExoBacteria Press Release\n\n",

The work is also known as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or simply Jekyll and Hyde. The novella follows Gabriel John Utterson, a London legal practitioner who investigates a series of strange occurrences between his old friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, and a murderous criminal named Edward Hyde. It is revealed at the end of the novella that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person, with Jekyll transforming into Hyde via an unnamed chemical concoction to live out his darker urges. \nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is one of the most famous pieces of English literature, and is considered to be a defining book of the gothic horror genre. The novella has also had a sizable impact on popular culture, with the phrase \"Jekyll and Hyde\" being used in vernacular to refer to people with an outwardly good but sometimes shockingly evil nature.\n\n== Inspiration and writing ==\nStevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how human personalities can reflect the interplay of good and evil. While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about William Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and which was produced for the first time in 1882. In early 1884, he wrote the short story \"Markheim\", which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual. According to his essay \"A Chapter on Dreams\" (Scribner's, Jan. 1888), he racked his brains for an idea for a story and had a dream, and upon waking had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Biographer, Graham Balfour, quoted Stevenson's wife, Fanny Stevenson: In the small hours of one morning,[...] I was awakened by cries of horror from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily: \"Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale.\" I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.\nLloyd Osbourne, Stevenson's stepson, wrote: \"I don't believe that there was ever such a literary feat before as the writing of Dr. Jekyll. I remember the first reading as though it were yesterday. Louis came downstairs in a fever; read nearly half the book aloud; and then, while we were still gasping, he was away again, and busy writing. I doubt if the first draft took so long as three days.\"Inspiration may also have come from the writer's friendship with an Edinburgh-based French teacher, Eugene Chantrelle, who was convicted and executed for the murder of his wife in May 1878. Chantrelle, who had appeared to lead a normal life in the city, poisoned his wife with opium. According to author Jeremy Hodges, Stevenson was present throughout the trial and as \"the evidence unfolded he found himself, like Dr. Jekyll, 'aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde'.\" Moreover, it was believed that the teacher had committed other murders both in France and Britain by poisoning his victims at supper parties with a \"favourite dish of toasted cheese and opium\".As was customary, Mrs. Stevenson would read the draft and offer her criticisms in the margins. Robert Stevenson was confined to bed at the time from a haemorrhage. In her comments in the manuscript, she observed that in effect the story was really an allegory, but Robert was writing it as a story. After a while, Robert called her back into the bedroom and pointed to a pile of ashes: he had burnt the manuscript in fear that he would try to salvage it, and thus forced himself to start again from nothing, writing an allegorical story as she had suggested. Scholars debate whether he really burnt his manuscript; there is no direct factual evidence for the burning, but it remains an integral part of the history of the novella.Stevenson rewrote the story in three to six days. A number of later biographers have alleged that Stevenson was on drugs during the frantic re-write; for example, William Gray's revisionist history A Literary Life (2004) said he used cocaine while other biographers said he used ergot. However, the standard history, according to the accounts of his wife and son (and himself), says he was bed-ridden and sick while writing it. According to Osbourne, \"The mere physical feat was tremendous and, instead of harming him, it roused and cheered him inexpressibly\". He continued to refine the work for four to six weeks after the initial revision. The novella was written in the southern English seaside town of Bournemouth, where Stevenson had moved to benefit from its sea air and warmer climate.The name Jekyll was borrowed from the Reverend Walter Jekyll, a friend of Stevenson and younger brother of horticulturalist and landscape designer Gertrude Jekyll.\n\n== Plot ==\nGabriel John Utterson and his cousin Richard Enfield reach the door of a large house on their weekly walk. Enfield tells Utterson that months ago, he saw a sinister-looking man named Edward Hyde trample a young girl after accidentally bumping into her. Enfield forced Hyde to pay her family £100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought Enfield to this door and gave him a cheque signed by a reputable gentleman later revealed to be Doctor Henry Jekyll, Utterson's friend and client. Utterson fears Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll, as Jekyll recently changed his will to make Hyde the sole beneficiary. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with Jekyll, Jekyll tells Utterson he can get rid of Hyde when he wants and asks him to drop the matter.\nOne night in October, a servant sees Hyde beat Sir Danvers Carew, another one of Utterson's clients, to death and leave behind half a broken cane. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find the other half of the broken cane. Utterson recognizes the cane as one he had given to Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble that he has caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde.\nFor two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner but, in early January, he starts refusing visitors. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual friend of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a conversation with Jekyll at his laboratory window. Jekyll suddenly slams the window shut and disappears, shocking and concerning Utterson.\nIn early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson and says Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and Poole break into the laboratory, where they find Hyde's body wearing Jekyll's clothes, apparently having killed himself. They find a letter from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's. Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drink a serum that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter explains he had indulged in unstated vices and feared discovery. He found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed body, Hyde, was evil, self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.\nJekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. Despite this, one night he had a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, his desires having been caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to Lanyon in Jekyll's hand, asking his friend to bring chemicals from his laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses of the serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Enfield and Utterson.\nEventually, one of the chemicals used in the serum ran low, and subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll speculated that one of the original ingredients must have had some unknown impurity that made it work. Realizing that he would stay transformed as Hyde, Jekyll wrote out a full account of the events and locked himself in his laboratory with the intent to keep Hyde imprisoned and, as Poole and Utterson smashed down the door to the laboratory, committed suicide by poison.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Gabriel John Utterson ===\nGabriel John Utterson, a lawyer and close loyal friend of Jekyll and Lanyon for many years, is the protagonist of the story. Utterson is measured and at all times emotionless bachelor – who nonetheless seems believable, trustworthy, tolerant of the faults of others, and indeed genuinely likeable. However, Utterson is not immune to guilt, as, while he is quick to investigate and judge the faults of others even for the benefit of his friends, Stevenson states that \"he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done\". Whatever these \"ill things\" may be, he does not partake in gossip or other views of the upper class out of respect for his fellow man. Often the last remaining friend of the downfallen, he finds an interest in others' downfalls, which creates a spark of interest not only in Jekyll but also regarding Hyde. He concludes that human downfall results from indulging oneself in topics of interest. As a result of this line of reasoning, he lives life as a recluse and \"dampens his taste for the finer items of life\". Utterson concludes that Jekyll lives life as he wishes by enjoying his occupation.\n\n=== Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward Hyde ===\nDr. Jekyll is a \"large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty with something of a slyish cast\", who occasionally feels he is battling between the good and evil within himself, leading to the struggle between his dual personalities of Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. He has spent a great part of his life trying to repress evil urges that were not fitting for a man of his stature. He creates a serum, or potion, in an attempt to separate this hidden evil from his personality. In doing so, Jekyll transformed into the smaller, younger, cruel, remorseless, and evil Hyde. Jekyll has many friends and an amiable personality, but as Hyde, he becomes mysterious and violent. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power. After taking the potion repeatedly, he no longer relies upon it to unleash his inner demon, i.e., his alter ego. Eventually, Hyde grows so strong that Jekyll becomes reliant on the potion to remain conscious throughout the book.\n\n=== Richard Enfield ===\nRichard Enfield is Utterson's cousin and is a well-known \"man about town\". He first sees Hyde at about three in the morning in an episode that is well documented as Hyde is running over a little girl. He is the person who mentions to Utterson the actual personality of Jekyll's friend, Hyde. Enfield witnessed Hyde recklessly running over a little girl in the street and the group of witnesses, with the girl's parents and other residents, force Hyde into writing a cheque for the girl's family. Enfield discovers that Jekyll signed the cheque, which is genuine. He says that Hyde is disgusting-looking but finds himself stumped when asked to describe the man.\n\n=== Dr. Hastie Lanyon ===\nA longtime friend of Jekyll, Hastie Lanyon disagrees with Jekyll's \"scientific\" concepts, which Lanyon describes as \"...too fanciful\". He is the first person to discover Hyde's true identity (Hyde transforms himself back into Jekyll in Lanyon's presence). Lanyon helps Utterson solve the case when he describes the letter given to him by Jekyll and his thoughts and reactions to the transformation. After he witnesses the transformation process (and subsequently hears Jekyll's private confession, made to him alone), Lanyon becomes shocked into critical illness and, later, death.\n\n=== Mr. Poole ===\nPoole is Jekyll's butler who has been employed by him for many years. Poole serves Jekyll faithfully and attempts to be loyal to his master, but the growing reclusiveness of and changes in his master cause him growing concern. Finally fearing that his master has been murdered and that his murderer, Mr. Hyde, is residing in Jekyll's chambers, Poole is driven into going to Utterson and joining forces with him to uncover the truth. He chops down the door towards Jekyll's lab in five strong swipes to aid Utterson in the climax.\n\n=== Inspector Newcomen ===\nUtterson joins this Scotland Yard inspector after the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. They explore Hyde's loft in Soho and discover evidence of his depraved life.\n\n=== Sir Danvers Carew, MP ===\nA kind, 70-year-old Member of Parliament. The maid claims that Hyde, in a murderous rage, killed Carew in the streets of London on the night of 18 October. At the time of his death, Carew is carrying on his person a letter addressed to Utterson, and the broken half of one of Jekyll's walking sticks is found on his body.\n\n=== Maid ===\nA maid, whose employer – presumably Jekyll – Hyde had once visited, is the only person who has witnessed the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. She saw Hyde murder Carew with Jekyll's cane and his feet. Having fainted after seeing what happened, she then wakes up and rushes to the police, thus initiating the murder case of Sir Danvers Carew.\n\n== Analysis of themes ==\nLiterary genres that critics have applied as a framework for interpreting the novel include religious allegory, fable, detective story, sensation fiction, doppelgänger literature, Scottish devil tales, and Gothic novel.\n\n=== Dualities ===\nThe novella is frequently interpreted as an examination of the duality of human nature, usually expressed as an inner struggle between good and evil, with variations such as human versus animal, civilisation versus barbarism sometimes substituted, the main point being that of an essential inner struggle between the one and other, and that the failure to accept this tension results in evil, or barbarity, or animal violence, being projected onto others. In Freudian theory, the thoughts and desires banished to the unconscious mind motivate the behaviour of the conscious mind. Banishing evil to the unconscious mind in an attempt to achieve perfect goodness can result in the development of a Mr. Hyde-type aspect to one's character.In Christian theology, Satan's fall from Heaven is due to his refusal to accept that he is a created being (that he has a dual nature) and is not God. This idea is suggested when Hyde says to Lanyon, shortly before drinking the famous potion: \"your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\" This is because, in Christianity, pride (to consider oneself as without sin or without evil) is a sin, as it is the precursor to evil itself.In his discussion of the novel, Vladimir Nabokov argues that the \"good versus evil\" view of the novel is misleading, as Jekyll himself is not, by Victorian standards, a morally good person in some cases.\n\n=== Public vs. private ===\nThe work is commonly associated today with the Victorian concern over the public and private division, the individual's sense of playing a part and the class division of London. In this respect, the novella has also been noted as \"one of the best guidebooks of the Victorian era\" because of its piercing description of the fundamental dichotomy of the 19th century \"outward respectability and inward lust\", as this period had a tendency for social hypocrisy.\n\n=== Scottish nationalism vs. union with Britain ===\nAnother common interpretation sees the novella's duality as representative of Scotland and the Scottish character. In this reading, the duality represents the national and linguistic dualities inherent in Scotland's relationship with the wider Britain and the English language, respectively, and also the repressive effects of the Church of Scotland on the Scottish character. A further parallel is also drawn with the city of Edinburgh itself, Stevenson's birthplace, which consists of two distinct parts: the old medieval section historically inhabited by the city's poor, where the dark crowded slums were rife with all types of crime, and the modern Georgian area of wide spacious streets representing respectability.\n\n=== Addiction ===\nSome scholars have argued that addiction or substance abuse is a central theme in the novella. Stevenson's depiction of Mr. Hyde is reminiscent of descriptions of substance abuse in the nineteenth century. Daniel L. Wright describes Dr. Jekyll as \"not so much a man of conflicted personality as a man suffering from the ravages of addiction\". Patricia Comitini argues that the central duality in the novella is in fact not Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but rather Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and Utterson, where Utterson represents the rational, unaddicted, ideal Victorian subject devoid of forbidden desires, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde constitutes his opposite.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Publication ===\nThe book was initially sold as a paperback for one shilling in the U.K. and for one penny in the U.S. These books were called \"shilling shockers\" or penny dreadfuls. The American publisher issued the book on 5 January 1886, four days before the first appearance of the U.K. edition issued by Longmans; Scribner's published 3,000 copies, only 1,250 of them bound in cloth. Initially, stores did not stock it until a review appeared in The Times on 25 January 1886 giving it a favourable reception. Within the next six months, close to 40 thousand copies were sold. As Stevenson's biographer Graham Balfour wrote in 1901, the book's success was probably due rather to the \"moral instincts of the public\" than to any conscious perception of the merits of its art. It was read by those who never read fiction and quoted in pulpit sermons and in religious papers. By 1901, it was estimated to have sold over 250,000 copies in the United States.\n\n=== The stage version of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ===\nAlthough the book had initially been published as a \"shilling shocker\", it was an immediate success and one of Stevenson's best-selling works. Stage adaptations began in Boston and London and soon moved all across England and then towards his home country of Scotland.The first stage adaptation followed the story's initial publication in 1886. Richard Mansfield bought the rights from Stevenson and worked with Boston author Thomas Russell Sullivan to write a script. The resulting play added to the cast of characters and some elements of romance to the plot. The addition of female characters to the originally male-centred plot continued in later adaptations of the story. The first performance of the play took place in the Boston Museum in May 1887. The lighting effects and makeup for Jekyll's transformation into Hyde created horrified reactions from the audience, and the play was so successful that production followed in London. After a successful 10 weeks in London in 1888, Mansfield was forced to close down production. The hysteria surrounding the Jack the Ripper serial murders led even those who only played murderers on stage to be considered suspects. When Mansfield was mentioned in London newspapers as a possible suspect for the crimes, he shut down production.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThere have been numerous adaptations of the novella, including over 120 stage and film versions alone.There have also been many audio recordings of the novella, with some of the more famous readers including Tom Baker, Roger Rees, Christopher Lee, Anthony Quayle, Martin Jarvis, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Gene Lockhart, Richard Armitage, John Sessions, Alan Howard, Rory Kinnear and Richard E. Grant.\nA 1990 musical based on the story was created by Frank Wildhorn, Steve Cuden, and Leslie Bricusse.\nThere have also been several video games based on the story.\n\n== Illustrated versions ==\nS. G. Hulme Beaman illustrated a 1930s edition, and in 1948 Mervyn Peake provided the newly founded Folio Society with memorable illustrations for the story.\n\n== See also ==\nThe Hulk, a fictional superhero whose creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\nLouis Vivet, a mental patient diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. His case caught Frederic W. H. Myers's attention, who wrote to Stevenson after the story was published. Stevenson was polite in his response, but rejected the interpretation that Dr Jekyll was suffering from DID.\nBritish singer Example directly references Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in his song \"Skies Don't Lie\". The song lyrics, referring to the duality of human character, read \"don't discriminate Jekyll or Hyde, everybody's different at night\".\nThe band  Riverside references Mr. Hyde in their song \"Parasomnia\", from the album \"Rapid Eye Movement\"\nSatanik, an Italian noir comic book created in December 1964: Marny Bannister, a female chemistry scientist whose face is marked by an angioma, develops a drug that transforms her into a fascinating woman. The drug has an unexpected side effect, making her a criminal mastermind.\nFive Finger Death Punch, a heavy metal band, has written a song by the name of Jekyll and Hyde in their sixth album Got Your Six.\nIce Nine Kills, a metalcore band has written a song by the name of Me, Myself & Hyde. The song is from their fourth album Every Trick in the Book.\n",

      "text": "Adolf Hitler (German:  (listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then assuming the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.\n\nHitler was born in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.\n\nBy November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support.\n\nHitler sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned.\n\n\nEvery one of his words comes out charged with a powerful current of energy; at times it seems as if they are tom from the very heart of the man, causing him indescribable anguish . 17\nLeaning from the tribune, as if he were trying to impel his inner self into the consciousness of all these thousands, he was holding the masses and me with them under a hypnotic spell. ... It was clear that Hitler was feeling the exaltation of the emotional re- sponse now surging up toward him ... his voice ris- ing to passionate climaxes ... his words were like a scourge. When he stopped speaking his chest was still heaving with emotion ",

      "text": "Chapter Four: Through the Fire\nLockwood Family Estate, Colorado Springs, Two Months After Disappearance Day, 1987\n     Aston had always appreciated the way rain sounded on glass. Settled comfortably in his Father’s Green Leather chair, a cup of tea in his hands, he stared pensively out the windows of the study across the expanse of lawn to the front gate. The steady throb of another party in the next room could be heard through the thick mahogany paneling and, with it, the distant tune of a Christmas Carol. Something about the sound was unnerving to Aston and it brought to his mind to many memories of the recent tragedy. The Lockwood family Estate sprawled across the majority of twenty acres and was at this moment lit up in nearly every window. It wasn’t Christmas Day yet, but the Lockwoods had hosted this party early to accommodate some of the schedules of the wealthiest socialites. It was events like these that brought in the big donations to the Lockwood Family Charity. Headlights lit up the misty dusk scene outside, and Aston watched as a beautiful sports car pulled up. The owner stepped out into the rain and a black umbrella expanded to cover his expensive suit while the eager valet boy ran to the far side of the car to assist the lady with her door. Aston observed as the couple shared the umbrella and exchanged hurried and grateful greetings with the Valet before heading inside the warmly lit front doors.  adding a strangely comforting aura to the serene atmosphere. The gentle howl of the wind and patter of rain on the windows elegantly framed the night scenery. \n            A log in the fireplace cracked loudly, and Aston jumped. The cup in his hand slipped and smashed against the hardwood floor. Having been startled from his comfortable trance, he exclaimed in annoyance and decided to let the maid clean up the glass. He stood and stretched, yawning loudly. He knew that they would be waiting for him in the loud room beyond the study door and did not much want to participate in his parent’s publicity stunts. He had writing to do. It wasn’t that he didn’t like parties; they just bored him. When everyone knows your name, it takes some of the fun of anonymity out of the whole experience. He wished that just once he could sit in the corner of the room and be unseen. As he thought this he found his gaze drawn to the magnificent portrait hanging over the ornate fireplace mantle. His Ancestor, Sigmund Lockwood, the original founder of the Lockwood Foundation, stared down with the confident stoicism that only a painting can possess. He had always wanted to be like the man but had never actually met him. Well, that wasn’t necessarily true, as he had held Aston the day he was born. But that could hardly count as meeting someone, could it? The flash of lightning out the floor-to-ceiling windows lit the room up for a moment and threw Aston’s shadow against the wall. He turned towards the towering bookshelves, filled to overflowing with classic books, memoirs, and untouched volumes that had gathered the dust of several centuries. Of all the Lockwoods, Sigmund was by far the best read, and, glancing back at the portrait, Aston smiled. In typical Lockwood fashion he had requested his portrait in the Library. He was shown leaning on several books stacked spine-out, worn with age. They were the most colorful parts of the portrait and were meant to send a message. This man was a reader. Aston leaned close to the painting, enjoying for a moment, the warmth of the fire. The three books were staggered, but their titles could clearly be made out. The Origin of the Human System, Beyond the Looking Glass by Lewis Carrol, and The Universal Opposite. He had read Carrol’s book, but the others were unfamiliar to him. Personally, he had found Beyond the Looking Glass to be somewhat uninspired, and he wondered what Sigmund saw in the book that he so loved. He had read it a long time ago and found it quite boring. A sudden shift in the wind, or perhaps someone falling down in the next room, caused the flame to jump. He wanted to search the bookshelf to see if the two unknown books were there. His curiosity had peaked. The now dimly lit room was insufficient and due to the family’s decision not to install electric lighting in the ancient room, he made to stoke the fire. He lifted a log and tossed it on the small black grate covered in coals. Taking the poker, he squatted and began poking the coals to coax the flame back into being. He continued stabbing into the ashes and looked longingly towards the shelf. That must have been the reason that he accidentally pressed his knee rather firmly on the hearth, and the hard marble caused him to wince in pain. As he recoiled from the hurt knee, the poker violently stabbed the back of the fireplace. Now, what Aston expected to hear was the thud of iron on marble. Instead, he heard a hollow thump followed by a click somewhere up in the wall behind his Uncle’s Portrait. The band in the next room picked up the tempo, but Aston hardly noticed. A few moments passed as he contemplated what had just happened. Then in a moment so sudden, the fire was gone. The dark room became a tomb punctuated with muffled music. Then he heard it. A whirring sound and from somewhere beyond the fireplace, a sliver of light appeared, and the marble backing began to open like a door.",

      "text": "Simo Häyhä (Finnish: [ˈsimo ˈhæy̯hæ] (listen); 17 December 1905 – 1 April 2002), often referred to by his nickname, The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper in World War II during the 1939–1940 Winter War against the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30 (a variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle) and a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. He is believed to have killed over 500 men during the Winter War, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war.[2][3][4][5]\n\nHäyhä estimated in his private war memoir that he shot around 500 enemy soldiers.[5][6] The memoir, titled Sotamuistoja (War memoirs), was written in 1940, a few months after he was wounded, and described his experiences in the Winter War from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940. Hidden for decades, the memoir was discovered in 2017.\nEarly life and youth\n\nHäyhä was born in the Kiiskinen hamlet of the Rautjärvi municipality in the Viipuri Province of southern Finland near the border with Russia.[7] He was the seventh of eight children in a Lutheran family of farmers;[8] his father, Juho Häyhä, was the owner of the Mattila farm while Simo's mother, Katriina (née Vilkko) was a loving and hard-working farmer's wife.[7] He attended school in the village of Miettilä in Kivennapa parish and cultivated his home farm together with his eldest brother. He was a farmer, hunter, and skier prior to his military service.\nMilitia and military service\nHäyhä during his first years in the Army\n\nHäyhä joined the Finnish voluntary militia Civil Guard (Suojeluskunta) at the age of 17. He was successful in shooting competitions in the Viipuri Province; his home was reportedly full of trophies for marksmanship.[9] He was not keen to hog the spotlight, and correspondingly in the group photos of his youth he usually stood at the back, until his later success started to force him to take centre place.[10]\n\nIn 1925, at the age of 19, Häyhä began his 15-month compulsory military service in the Bicycle Battalion 2 in Raivola, Viipuri Province. He attended the Non-Commissioned Officer School and served as a conscript officer in the Bicycle Battalion 1 in Terijoki. However, he did not receive formal sniper training until a year before the war in 1938 at a training centre in Utti.[7]\n\nAccording to Major Tapio Saarelainen—who met Häyhä several times and has written five books about him, including his biography—Häyhä was able to estimate distances with an accuracy of 1 metre (3.3 ft) up to 150 metres (500 ft).[11] Saarelainen notes that during his Civil Guard training, Häyhä once hit a target 16 times from 150 metres away in just one minute. \"This was an unbelievable accomplishment with a bolt action rifle, considering that each cartridge had to be manually fed with a fixed magazine that held together five cartridges.\"[12]\nWinter War service\nAbout to kill a Russian soldier and then overhears something unusual about the arctic.\nIn a coma after being shot in the jaw. \n\nHäyhä served as a sniper in the Finnish Army during the 1939–40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, under Lieutenant Aarne Juutilainen in the 6th Company of Infantry Regiment 34 (Jalkaväkirykmentti 34, or JR 34) during the Battle of Kollaa in temperatures between −40 and −20 °C (−40 and −4 °F). He was dressed completely in white camouflage; Soviet troops were not issued camouflage uniforms for most of the war, making them easily visible to snipers in winter conditions. Joseph Stalin had purged military experts in the late 1930s as part of the Great Purge, and the Red Army was consequently highly disorganized.[13]\n\nFinnish sources state that Häyhä was nicknamed \"The White Death\" by the Red Army (Russian: Белая смерть, Belaja smert; Finnish: valkoinen kuolema; Swedish: den vita döden).[7] The name \"White Death\" has been suggested to originate entirely in Finnish propaganda, rather than having been given to Häyhä by the Russians; according to information from prisoners, to the Russians \"White Death\" referred to a severe frost in the deep forest. Häyhä having the nickname \"White Death\" first appeared in the Finnish Winter War literature of the late 1980s.[14] During the war, the \"White Death\" was one of the leading themes of Finnish propaganda.[15] Finnish newspapers frequently featured the invisible Finnish soldier, thus creating a hero of mythical proportions.[15][16] To add to the myth, he was also nicknamed \"The Magic Shooter\" among Finns (Finnish: taika-ampuja, in close reference to the Finnish word for \"sniper\"; Finnish: tarkka-ampuja).[7]\n\nHäyhä's war memoir states that they captured a Soviet soldier, blindfolded him, spun him around until he was disoriented, and then took him to a party in the tent of Häyhä's company Lieutenant Aarne \"The Terror of Morocco\" Juutilainen. The Soviet soldier was overjoyed by the carousing and was disappointed when he was released.[6][5]\nAchievements as a sniper\nHäyhä in Kollaa on 17 February 1940, right after being awarded the honorary rifle.\n\nAll of Häyhä's kills were accomplished in less than 100 days, an average of five per day at a time of year with very few daylight hours.[17][18][19] His kill count as a sniper was based on his own reporting, with the confirmation of his comrades, and only those who were verified to be dead were counted. No count was taken when several snipers shot at the same target. Men killed with a submachine gun with Häyhä as a group leader were not counted.[20]\n\nHäyhä's division commander Antero Svensson credited him with 219 confirmed kills with a rifle and an equal number of kills by submachine gun, when he awarded Häyhä with an honorary rifle on 17 February 1940.[21] On 21 December 1939, Häyhä achieved his highest daily count of 25 kills. In his diary, military chaplain Antti Rantamaa reported 259 confirmed kills made by rifle and an equal number of kills by submachine gun from the beginning of the war until 7 March 1940, one day after Häyhä was severely wounded. Later in his book, Rantamaa credited Häyhä with a total of 542 kills.[7]\n\nSome of Häyhä's figures are from a Finnish Army document, counted from the beginning of the war, 30 November 1939:\n\n    22 December 1939: 138 sniper kills in 22 days[22]\n    26 January 1940: 199 sniper kills (61 in 35 days)[23]\n    17 February 1940: 219 sniper kills (20 in 22 days)[7]\n    7 March 1940 (one day after he was wounded): total of 259 sniper kills (40 in 18 days)[7]\n\nHäyhä never discussed it publicly, but his own private memoir, discovered in 2017, states a number. He begins by stating that \"this is his sin list\", and estimates the total number shot by him to be around 500.[6][5]\n\nFinnish historian Risto Marjomaa questions the large number, as confirmation of casualties was difficult due to the absence of the bodies. In his article, published by the National Biography of Finland, Marjomaa credited Häyhä with the total number of \"more than two hundred\" kills.[24] Complicating matters further is the use of Häyhä's achievements as a tool of propaganda: the Finnish press built a hero's myth around Häyhä at the early stage of the war.[25]\nFirearms and tactics\n\nHäyhä used his issued Civil Guard rifle, an early series SAKO M/28-30, serial number 35281, Civil Guard number S60974. It was a Finnish Civil Guard variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle known as \"Pystykorva\" (lit. 'The Spitz' due to the front sight's resemblance to the head of a spitz-type dog) chambered in the Finnish-designed Mosin–Nagant cartridge 7.62×53R. When fighting as a group leader with the rest of his unit, he used a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun.\n\nHäyhä preferred iron sights over telescopic sights, as they enable a sniper to present a smaller target for the enemy (a sniper must raise his head a few centimetres higher when using a telescopic sight), and can be relied on even in extreme cold, unlike telescopic sights which tend to cloud up in cold weather. Another disadvantage of telescopic sights is that sunlight may reflect off the lenses and reveal the sniper's position. Häyhä did not have prior training with scoped rifles, and therefore preferred not to switch to the Soviet scoped rifle (M/91-30 PE or PEM).\n\nHäyhä dealt with the intense cold by dressing properly with multiple layers of clothing. He kept sugar and bread in his pockets, consuming them for the calories necessary to keep his body warm. His slight stature of 160 centimetres (5 ft 3 in) assisted him in disguising his position. Hidden in a snow pit, he could lie still and observe the enemy for long periods of time.[21] It was Häyhä's custom to move, well before daybreak, to the position he had prepared, and stay there until after sunset.[21] He would frequently pack dense mounds of snow in front of his position to conceal himself, provide padding for his rifle, and reduce the characteristic puff of snow stirred up by the muzzle blast. He was known to keep snow in his mouth while sniping to prevent his breath in the cold air from giving away his position.[26]\nInjury\nHäyhä after being promoted to second lieutenant in 1940. He was disfigured after being shot in the face by a Red Army soldier earlier that year\n\nOn 6 March 1940, Häyhä was severely wounded after an explosive bullet fired by a Red Army soldier hit his lower left jaw.[27] After the battle, as he appeared to be dead, he was placed on a pile of dead bodies. A fellow soldier, under orders from his commanding officer, searched for Häyhä, noticed a leg twitching among the pile and found Häyhä alive, although unconscious.[12] He was evacuated by fellow soldiers who said that \"half his face was missing\". The bullet had removed his upper jaw, most of his lower jaw, and most of his left cheek.[12]\n\nRumours of Häyhä's death spread around in Finland and the Soviet Union. He regained consciousness a week later on 13 March, the day that peace was declared. He read about his own death in a newspaper, and sent a letter to the paper to correct the misunderstanding.[10] He spent 14 months recovering from his wounds and endured 26 surgeries.[12]\n\nHäyhä wished to serve in the Continuation War (1941–1944). However, he was excused due to the severity of his facial injuries, from which he was still recovering.\n\n\n\nBorn in the municipality of Rautjärvi, Finland, Simo Häyhä joined the Finnish militia in 1922 while retaining his primary profession as a farmer and a hunter, the latter of which honed his skills as an expert marksman. During the Winter War which began in late 1939, he served with 6th Company of Finnish Infantry Regiment 34 in the region of the Kollaa River. In cold weather during days which daylight time lasted only a few hours, as a sniper using a White Guard M/28 \"Pystykorva\" rifle (a variant of the Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle) he scored 505 confirmed kills (plus 37 unconfirmed kills) in less than 100 days; the score of 505 made him the most successful sniper in any major war. As an infantryman using a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun, he claimed an additional 200 kills. He preferred using iron sights due to the more technologically advanced telescopic sights as they were easy to use and iron sights allowed him to keep a lower profile. Among his favored secrets was to hold snow in his mouth so that this breathing would not fog, which might betray his position. He was given the nickname of Belaya Smert, or \"White Death\", by the Russian troops. Häyhä was severely injured in the lower left jaw in combat in the final days of the Winter War. After the Winter War, he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant by Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim for his achievement. Recovery from his jaw injury took years, causing him to play no further part in WW2. After the war, he became a successful moose hunter and dog breeder. He passed away in 2002.\n\nww2dbaseSources:\nRobert Stirling, Special Forces Sniper Skills\nWikipedia\n\nLast Major Revision: Nov 2013\n\nSimo Häyhä Timeline\n17 Dec 1905 \tSimo Häyhä was born in Rautjärvi, Finland.\n6 Mar 1940 \tSimo Häyhä was shot in the lower left jaw by a Soviet soldier in combat in Finland.\n13 Mar 1940 \tSimo Häyhä regained consciousness after being severely injured in the face in combat a week prior in Finland.\n28 Aug 1940 \tSimo Häyhä was promoted from the rank of corporal directly to the rank of second lieutenant by Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim.\n1 Apr 2002 \tSimo Häyhä passed away in Hamina, Finland.\n\n\nFinland participated in the Second World War initially in a defensive war against the Soviet Union, followed by another battle against the Soviet Union acting in concert with Nazi Germany and then finally fighting alongside the Allies against Nazi Germany. As relations with the Soviet Union changed during the war, Finland was placed in the situation of being for, then against and then for the overall interests of the Allied powers.\nThe first two major conflicts in which Finland was directly involved were the defensive Winter War against an invasion by the Soviet Union in 1939, followed by the Continuation War, together with Germany and the other Axis Powers against the Soviets, in 1941–1944. The third conflict, the Lapland War against Germany in 1944–1945, followed the signing of the Moscow Armistice with the Allied Powers, which stipulated expulsion of Nazi German forces from Finnish territory.\nBy the end of hostilities, Finland remained an independent country, albeit \"Finlandized\", but had to cede nearly 10% of its territory, including its fourth largest city, Viipuri (Vyborg), pay out a large amount of war reparations to the Soviet Union, and formally acknowledge partial responsibility for the Continuation War. As a result of this territorial loss, all East Karelians abandoned their homes, relocating to areas that remained within the borders of Finland.\nHäyhä used overhanging branches for cover, which provided better protection and allowed him to keep a steady aim.The Winter War broke out when he was 33 years old and on 17 December 1939, he celebrated his 34th birthday on the Kollaa battlefield. He served a total of 98 days with 6th Battalion, Infantry Regiment 34. The war lasted only 105 days, but Simo Häyhä did not see its end – he was wounded and hospitalised during the last week of the conflict.\nDuring his 98-day reign of terror, Häyhä was unseen and unheard, yet was all the while targeting Russian soldiers with deadly accuracy, once even killing 25 men in one day. With snipers presenting such a high-value targets on the battlefield, Simo’s reputation as a marksman soon reached the Russian front lines; they referred to him as “The White Death”.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are considered milestones in the field of crime fiction.\nMedical career \nFrom 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School; during this period he spent time working in Aston (then a town in Warwickshire, now part of Birmingham), Sheffield and Ruyton-XI-Towns, Shropshire. Also during this period, he studied practical botany at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. While studying, Doyle began writing short stories. His earliest extant fiction, \"The Haunted Grange of Goresthorpe\", was unsuccessfully submitted to Blackwood's Magazine. His first published piece, \"The Mystery of Sasassa Valley\", a story set in South Africa, was printed in Chambers's Edinburgh Journal on 6 September 1879. On 20 September 1879, he published his first academic article, \"Gelsemium as a Poison\" in the British Medical Journal, a study which The Daily Telegraph regarded as potentially useful in a 21st-century murder investigation. \nHolmes was partially modelled on Doyle's former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, in a letter to Bell, Doyle wrote, \"It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes ... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man\", and in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, \"It is no wonder that after the study of such a character I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal.\" Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: \"My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes. ... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?\" Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, Edgar Allan Poe's character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr. James Watson. \n \nArkhangelsk Oblast was an island that he named after the inspiration for sherlock Holmes\n \n\nSherlock Holmes statue in Edinburgh, erected opposite the birthplace of Doyle, which was demolished c. 1970\nA sequel to A Study in Scarlet was commissioned, and The Sign of the Four appeared in Lippincott's Magazine in February 1890, under agreement with the Ward Lock company. Doyle felt grievously exploited by Ward Lock as an author new to the publishing world, and so, after this, he left them. Short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the Strand Magazine. Doyle wrote the first five Holmes short stories from his office at 2 Upper Wimpole Street (then known as Devonshire Place), which is now marked by a memorial plaque. \nDoyle's attitude towards his most famous creation was ambivalent. In November 1891, he wrote to his mother: \"I think of slaying Holmes, ... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things.\" His mother responded, \"You won't! You can't! You mustn't!\" In an attempt to deflect publishers' demands for more Holmes stories, he raised his price to a level intended to discourage them, but found they were willing to pay even the large sums he asked. As a result, he became one of the best-paid authors of his time.\nThe Kecksburg UFO incident occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States in North America, when a fireball was reported by citizens of six U.S. states and Canada over Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Canada. Astronomers said it was likely a meteor bolide burning up in the atmosphere and descending at a steep angle. NASA released a statement in 2005 reporting that experts had examined fragments from the area and determined they were from a Soviet satellite, but records of their findings were lost in the 1990s. NASA responded to court orders and Freedom of Information Act requests to search for the records. The incident gained wide notoriety in popular culture and UFOlogy, with speculations ranging from alien craft to debris from the Soviet space probe Kosmos 96, and is often referred to as \"Pennsylvania's Roswell\". \nTom Hulton visits his friend Jack who lives in Goresthorpe in Norfolk. In order to convince him of the existence of ghosts, he proposes a hunting ghost in his mansion. They go and choose a small room to wait. A few minutes later, they hear drops falling from the old ceiling. To their surprise and fright, they notice it's not water but blood. They decide to visit the room above, but as they enter the hall they saw an apparition approaching them. It is the ghost of a man of the 18th century who looks scared and chased. When he disappears, another appearance arises, a ghost of a woman this time. She seems to follow the first one with a threatening manner. The two men quickly leave the house and return to the village. Analyzing the situation, they understand that the ghost of the woman was the victim of the man, and she now haunts the ghost of her killer. \nNovels \nThe four novels of the canon:\nA Study in Scarlet (1887)\nThe Sign of the Four (1890)\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902)\nThe Valley of Fear (1914–1915)\nShort stories \nThe 56 short stories are collected in five books:\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892)\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894)\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905)\nHis Last Bow (1917)\nThe Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1927)\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892) \nPublished 14 October 1892; contains 12 stories published in The Strand between July 1891 and June 1892 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget. \n\"A Scandal in Bohemia\" (June 1891)\n\"The Red-Headed League\" (August 1891)\n\"A Case of Identity\" (September 1891)\n\"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\" (October 1891)\n\"The Five Orange Pips\" (November 1891)\n\"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" (December 1891)\n\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\" (January 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" (February 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\" (March 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\" (April 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\" (May 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\" (June 1892)\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1893–94) \n\nFirst edition cover of The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, published 1894.\nContains 12 stories published in The Strand as further episodes of the Adventures between December 1892 and December 1893 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget (after the magazine publication, Doyle included \"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" only in the His Last Bow collection).\n\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\" (December 1892)\n\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" (January 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\" (February 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk\" (March 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott\" (April 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\" (May 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Reigate Squire\" (June 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\" (July 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\" (August 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\" (September 1893)\n\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\" (October–November 1893)\n\"The Final Problem\" (December 1893)\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905) \nContains 13 stories published in The Strand between October 1903 and December 1904 with original illustrations by Sidney Paget.\n\"The Adventure of the Empty House\" (October 1903)\n\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\" (November 1903)\n\"The Adventure of the Dancing Men\" (December 1903)\n\"The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\" (January 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Priory School\" (February 1904)\n\"The Adventure of Black Peter\" (March 1904)\n\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\" (April 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons\" (May 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Three Students\" (June 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\" (July 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\" (August 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Abbey Grange\" (September 1904)\n\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\" (December 1904)\nHis Last Bow (1917) \nContains 7 stories published 1908–1917.

After the mystery is described in full, it is stated that a letter appeared in the press, giving a proposed solution from \"an amateur reasoner of some celebrity\". It is possible, and has been proposed by Haining, Tracy, and Green, amongst others that this \"amateur reasoner\" was Sherlock Holmes. The strongest clue to this is the quotation, \"once one has eliminated the impossible...\", used by Holmes throughout his deductions. However, this suggested solution is proved wrong by a confession from the organising criminal once he is later arrested for an unrelated crime. Haining suggested that Doyle was \"getting out some Holmes\" during the series hiatus, but given the failure of the unnamed detective it appears he was parodying his most famous creation. The story was published in book form in Arthur Conan Doyle's Tales of Terror and Mystery in 1923 and has for years appeared in French editions of the complete adventures. \n\"The Story of the Man with the Watches\" (1898) \nLike \"The Story of the Lost Special\", \"The Story of the Man with the Watches\" appeared in the Strand (in 1898), and later in Round the Fire Stories and Tales of Terror and Mystery. It follows the same pattern; the mystery this time surrounds the appearance of a dead man in a railway carriage, with six pocket watches in his jacket. An explanation is offered by an amateur detective but the narrator notes that it is flawed, as it doesn't take into account all the facts. A man involved in the accidental murder of the victim writes a letter to the detective, saying that it was a \"mighty clever solution\" but entirely incorrect and continues to share the true events of that day. It shares the same backing for categorising as a Sherlock Holmes story as \"The Story of the Lost Special\", and appears in French anthologies. The story was adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 2009 as \"The Thirteen Watches\", in an episode from The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The number of watches was changed because the new title came from a reference (in the Holmes story \"The Noble Bachelor\") to Holmes' involvement with the watches incident. The story was also adapted for radio in 2012 as \"The Addleton Tragedy\", an episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. \nThese are actually true things that Doyle witnessed but could not write about publicly. \n\nHolmes arrives at Dr. John Watson's residence one evening in a somewhat agitated state and with grazed and bleeding knuckles. Much to Watson's surprise and horror, Holmes had apparently escaped three separate murder attempts that day after a visit from Professor Moriarty, who warned Holmes to withdraw from his pursuit of justice against him to avoid any regrettable outcome. First, just as Holmes was turning a street corner, a cab suddenly rushed toward him and he just managed to leap out of the way in time.\n\nHolmes has been tracking Moriarty and his agents for months and is on the brink of snaring them all and delivering them to the dock. Moriarty is the criminal genius behind a highly organised and extremely secret criminal force and Holmes will consider it the crowning achievement of his career if he can defeat Moriarty. Moriarty is out to thwart Holmes's plans and is well capable of doing so, for he is, as Holmes admits, the great detective's intellectual equal.\nHolmes asks Watson to come to the continent with him, giving him unusual instructions designed to hide his tracks to the boat train at Victoria station. Holmes is not quite sure where they will go, which seems rather odd to Watson. Holmes, certain that he has been followed to his friend's house, then makes off by climbing over the back wall in the garden. The next day Watson follows Holmes's instructions to the letter and finds himself waiting in the reserved first-class coach for his friend, but only an elderly Italian priest is there. The cleric soon makes it apparent that he is, in fact, Holmes in disguise.\n\nHolmes and Moriarty, 1893 illustration by Harry C. Edwards in McClure's\nAs the boat train pulls out of Victoria, Holmes spots Moriarty on the platform, making gestures in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the train. Holmes is forced to take action as Moriarty has obviously tracked Watson, despite extraordinary precautions. Holmes and Watson alight at Canterbury, making a change to their planned route. As they are waiting for another train to Newhaven a special one-coach train roars through Canterbury, as Holmes suspected it would. It contains the professor, who has hired the train in an effort to overtake Holmes. Holmes and Watson are forced to hide behind luggage.\nHaving made their way to Strasbourg via Brussels, the following Monday Holmes receives a message that most of Moriarty's gang have been arrested in England and recommends Watson return there now, as the detective will likely prove to be a very dangerous companion. Watson, however, decides to stay with his friend. Moriarty himself has slipped out of the grasp of the English police and is obviously with them on the continent.\nHolmes and Watson's journey takes them to Switzerland where they stay at Meiringen. From there they fatefully decide to take a walk which will include a visit to the Reichenbach Falls, a local natural wonder. Once there, a boy appears and hands Watson a letter, saying that there is a sick Englishwoman back at the hotel who wants an English doctor. Holmes realises at once it is a hoax although he does not say so. Watson goes to see about the patient, leaving Holmes by himself.\nUpon returning to the Englischer Hof, Watson finds that the innkeeper has no knowledge of any sick Englishwoman. Realising at last that he has been deceived, he rushes back to the Reichenbach Falls but finds no one there, although he does see two sets of footprints going out onto the muddy dead end path with none returning. There is also a note from Holmes, explaining that he knew the report Watson was given to be a hoax and that he is about to fight Moriarty, who has graciously given him enough time to pen this last letter. Watson sees that towards the end of the path there are signs that a violent struggle has taken place and there are no returning footprints. It is all too clear Holmes and Moriarty have both fallen to their deaths down the gorge while locked in mortal combat. Saddened, Dr. Watson returns to England. The Moriarty gang are all convicted on the strength of evidence secured by Holmes. Watson ends his narrative by saying that Sherlock Holmes was the best and the wisest man he had ever known.\n",

      "text": "Several high-level inventors in the late 1800s to early 1900s believed they had been contacted via the radio by extraterrestrials. This is what they had to say.\nThe first was Tesla. In an article titled “Talking with the Planets” for Collier’s Weekly in 1901, Tesla claimed he received strange signals while experimenting with radio at his lab in Colorado Springs in 1899. \n“Even now, at times, I can vividly recall the incident, and see my apparatus as though it were actually before me,” wrote Tesla. “My first observations positively terrified me, as there was present in them something mysterious, not to say supernatural, and I was alone in my laboratory at night; but at that time the idea of these disturbances being intelligently controlled signals did not yet present itself to me.”\n“It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control,” Tesla continued. “Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.”\nThe article goes on to argue that despite whether the signal was from aliens or not (Tesla suspected it would likely be Martians) the technology he was working on would have the potential to be used to communicate distances as vast as those between the panels in our solar system. This may have been the first time anyone used the “I am not saying it’s aliens, but…” line. Which was pretty bold at the time, especially given that earlier in the article, he noted skeptics questioned whether two-way radio communication was possible.\nMarconi shared his alien signal encounter in an article in 1920.\n“I have encountered during my experiments with wireless telegraphy [a] most amazing phenomenon,” wrote Marconi. “Most striking of all is receipt by me personally of signals which I believe originated in the space beyond our planet. I believe it is entirely possible that these signals may have been sent by the inhabitants of other planets to the inhabitants of earth.”\nMarconi seemed more certain that his encounter was an alien communication. \n“If there are any human beings on Mars I would not be surprised if they should find a means of communication with this planet,” Marconi posited. “Linking of the science of astronomy with that of electricity may bring about almost anything.”\nAnother famous inventor of the time, Thomas Edison, agreed with Marconi’s speculation.\n“Although I am not an expert in wireless telegraphy, I can plainly see that the mysterious wireless interruptions experience by Mr. Marconi’s operators may be good grounds for the theory that inhabitants of other planets are trying to signal us,” Edison argued. “Mr. Marconi is quite right in stating that this is entirely within the realm of possible.”\nEdison didn’t stop there. He went on to argue that there must be other intelligent life out there.\n“If we are to accept the theory of Mr. Marconi that these signals are being sent out by inhabitants of other planets, we must as once accept with it the theory of their advanced development,” wrote Edison. “Either they are our intellectual equal or our superiors. It would be stupid of us to assume that we have the corner on all the intelligence in the universe.”\n“Marconi’s idea of communicating with the other planets is the greatest and most fascinating problem confronting the human imagination today,” stated Tesla. “To insure (sic) success a body of competent scientists should be organized to study all possible plans and put into excitation the best. The matter should be directed probably by astronomers with sufficient backing from men with money and imagination. Supposing that there are intelligent human beings on Mars, success is easily within the range of possibility.”\nHe also shared the fact that he had a similar experience.\n“One day my ear caught what seemed to be regular signals,” said Tesla. “I knew they could not have been produced upon Earth. The possibility that they came from Mars occurred to me, but the pressure of business affairs caused me to drop the experiment.”\nThese were not the only famous scientists to chime on on Marconi’s experience. Albert Einstein himself was asked for his thoughts as well.\n“There is every reason to believe that Mars and other planets are inhabited,” said Einstein. “Why should the earth be the only planet supporting human life? It is not singular in any other respect. But if intelligent creatures do exist, as we may assume they do elsewhere in the universe, I should not expect them to try to communicate with the earth by wireless [radio]. Light rays, the direction of which can be controlled much more easily, would more probably be the first method attempted.”\nMarconi’s speculation that he had sought alien signals had quite an effect. In 1924, the Secretary of the Navy felt that the close approach of Mars would be an opportune time to listen in for signals from Martians. He sent out a telegram asking radio stations to listen in.\n Although Einstein suggested looking for light signals (lasers) rather than listening to radio waves to search for alien signals, radio waves became the predominant method used.\nWill aliens send us a signal on the radio? Some believe perhaps they already have. But we have yet to have received a confirmed communication. As for the characters in The Vast of Night, if they do believe they caught an alien signal, they’re in good company. Some of the biggest brains in the business have thought it was possible.\n",

      "text": " \n1946 - With thousands of veterans returning to college, The President's Commission on Higher Education is given the task of reexamining the role of colleges and universities in post-war America.  The first volume of its report, often referred to as the Truman Commission Report, is issued in 1947 and recommends sweeping changes in higher education, including doubling college enrollments by 1960 and extending free public education through the establishment of a network of community colleges. This latter recommendation comes to fruition in the 1960s, during which community college enrollment more than triples.  \n(American Educational History Timeline, n.d.)\nDuring the presidency of Nicholas Murray Butler (1902–1945), Columbia emerged as a preeminent national center for educational innovation and scholarly achievement. The School of Journalism was established by bequest of Joseph Pulitzer in 1912. John Erskine taught the first Great Books Honors Seminar at Columbia College in 1919, making the study of original masterworks the foundation of undergraduate education, and in the same year, a course on war and peace studies originated the College's influential Core Curriculum.\nThe study of the sciences flourished along with the liberal arts. Franz Boas founded the modern science of anthropology here in the early decades of the twentieth century, even as Thomas Hunt Morgan set the course for modern genetics. In 1928, Columbia–Presbyterian Medical Center, the first such center to combine teaching, research, and patient care, was officially opened as a joint project between the medical school and The Presbyterian Hospital.\n \nResearch into the atom by faculty members I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi, and Polykarp Kusch brought Columbia's Department of Physics to international prominence in the 1940s. The founding of the School of International Affairs (now the School of International and Public Affairs) in 1946 marked the beginning of intensive growth in international relations as a major scholarly focus of the University. The oral-history movement in the United States was launched at Columbia in 1948.(History | Columbia University in the City of New York, n.d.)\n",

      "text": "Aliens and the UFO\nOn numerous occasions, UFOs have been reported over nuclear power plants as well as nuclear research facilities and nuclear weapons storage bunkers at military bases.[1]  A good percentage of these reports occurred at highly restricted government research and production facilities, such as Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Hanford AEC, and Savannah River AEC. Highly trained government scientists and military personnel, who had been granted top-secret military clearances, made many of these reports.\n In a well-documented series of incidents in early November 1975, nocturnal lights and unidentified “mystery helicopters” visited a wide spectrum of American military bases and missile sites across the northern tier of this country. Between October 27 and November 10, reports of UFOs over nuclear weapons storage sites were repeatedly made at Loring AFB in northern Maine, Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan, Grand Forks and Minot Air Force Bases in North Dakota, and Malmstrom AFB in Montana. F-106 interceptors were scrambled out of Malmstrom AFB near Great Falls, Montana in response to multiple reports of UFO visits to nearby missile sites near Moore, Harlowton, Lewistown, and several missile sites around Malmstrom AFB.[2]\n A similar rash of incursions occurred in December 1948 (Los Alamos), December 1950 (Oak Ridge), July 1952 (Hanford AEC, Savannah River AEC, and Los Alamos), August 1965 (Warren AFB near Cheyenne, WY), March 1967 (Minot AFB, Malmstrom AFB, and Los Alamos), August 1968 (Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota), August 1980 (Warren AFB, Sandia Labs and Kirtland AFB, NM), December 1980 (Benwaters RAFB, Suffolk, England), and October 1991 (Chernobyl, Ukraine and Arkhangel’sk Missile Base, Russia).\n These reports led some to speculate that the intelligences behind UFOs have an interest in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.  One feature of these reports suggesting a direct link deals with light rays or energy beams being focused on nuclear materials.[3] Multiple independent accounts state that beams of light were directed downward from the UFOs onto the nuclear storage bunkers and underground missile silos, perhaps penetrating them beneath the surface.[4] [5]  In addition, there have been unsubstantiated rumors from enlisted men that the telemetry of the weapons at some sites had been changed or that other weapons had been rendered inoperative.\n\n",

      "text": "Die Glocke (German: [diː ˈɡlɔkə], \"The Bell\") was a purported top-secret Nazi scientific technological device, secret weapon, or Wunderwaffe. First described by Polish journalist and author Igor Witkowski in Prawda o Wunderwaffe (2000), it was later popularized by military journalist and author Nick Cook who associated it with Nazi occultism, antigravity and free energy research. Mainstream reviewers have criticized claims about Die Glocke as being pseudoscientific, recycled rumors, and a hoax. Die Glocke and other alleged Nazi \"miracle weapons\" have been dramatized in video games, television shows, and novels\nLocation\nThe Nazi Bell was initially housed in a basement beneath the Charity hospital in Berlin and thus the project was known as Charite Anlage. \nFrom November 1943 the Nazi bell was housed in an underground laboratory beneath Gandau airfield on the western outskirts of Breslau, now known as the Polish city of Wroclaw. Xerum 525 compounds were supplied from a laboratory in the city of Danzig now known as Gydina. After operation the spent and altered compound was reprocessed at a laboratory west of Breslau then known as Neuberg.\nIt was shifted from Gandau in November 1944 to Furstenstein Castle and later in December 1944 located inside Wenceslas mine. Following the war Professor Manfred von Ardenne led two Soviet scientists Nicolai Flyerov (aka N.I. Frolov) and Igor Kurchatov to the Wenceslas mine and gave them a description of installing what he called a cyclotron in the mine.\nThis mine was abandoned before the war. Above ground there was a power station with two steam cooling towers. The bases of these have become known by various names like the \"Henge\" after Stonehenge, or the Fly Trap. Bizarre claims are made by some that these are related to Nazi UFOs.  \nNear the mine entrance, Nobel Dynamit AG operated a bullet manufacturing plant. Wenceslas mine was also known by it's codename Komplex Milkow. A short distance away was Ludwikowice. The area in wartime had been part of Germany's Silesia region, but after the war most Germans were forced into East Germany and their homes were turned over to Polish refugees. In German the village was called Ludwidsdorf.",

It was that time of the afternoon that shrouds its visitors in golden haze. He felt the haze. However, it had nothing to do with the time. In fact, he had things that needed to be done and places to be. None of that mattered. Her. The woman. The perfect image of a woman. He stood for a moment lost in thought, mesmerized by her. She was in a simple light blue dress with a white cardigan and scarf. A little under-dressed for the gala but that was what drew his attention the most. She seemed to him to move in slow motion. A gentle smile crossed her slender face and his own unconsciously smiled as well. She just had that kind of face, was it her face? What was so magical about this woman? Then without a moment’s pause he began descending the small staircase to the main level. The room was packed with wealthy guests and famous faces. He barely noticed the stout form of Leslie Graves who was in a heated discussion with someone he would have recognized if he had tried. But the woman. As he pressed through the mob of millionaires and shiny suits he could see her making her way towards a table against the far wall. Then, and it happened completely by accident, she caught his gaze. Just for a moment, they locked eyes, and his heart leaped into his throat like he was a schoolboy again. He was both amused and terrified by this. He saw something change in her eyes, some common curiosity, or was it familiarity? As he walked towards her, slowly nodding politely to the other guests as he passed. Don’t hurry. They were closer, so close. Then within mere moments of the first time, he had seen the mysterious Lillian Aster they were closer than he had ever felt with anyone. I couldn’t help but come and say hello. He started, feeling a touch awkward at how directly he had made his approach. I’m glad you did, saved me the trouble of getting your attention myself. She smiled, and he noticed that she had dimples. He laughed and asked would you like a drink ma’am? Without hesitation, she said she would love one but she had given up alcohol long ago and vowed to never touch it again. What a woman he thought and they sat down together at a mahogany table under the smallest crystal chandelier he had ever seen. The glimmer in her eyes was, to him, deeper in hue than the rainbows thrown around the wallpapered walls from the light above. What is your name? He asked, his eyes never leaving hers. “It’s Lillian,” she replied with just the slightest hesitation, “what’s yours?”. He smiled and noticed that her eyes were the most captivating shade of green he had ever… wait. He paused in confusion. \n“What’s yours?” echoed back in his mind. What’s yours? My what?... wait. He felt something. Somewhere deep inside, a tiny tingle in the legs that turned them numb and an ache in the back of his neck. It was panic.\n“What’s yours??” He seemed to see the room begin to ripple and she, her… The woman… Lillian slowly faded to black.\n\n",

Regardless, he awoke and stretched, yawning loudly into the morning air. For a moment he sat motionless, his eyes closed just listening. The glen felt joyful and new somehow. Like yesterday’s rain had left behind it a small piece of the heaven from which it fell. Joy like rain. Tweet Tweet Ckurrr ckuurrrr went the little bird far above him somewhere in the upper limbs of the tall oak.\n \nChristopher awoke with a start. The dark room was as black as night. He momentarily clutched at his chest in panic but the faithful metal of the key and chain reassured him. Then like a wave he remembered. A wave of deep black nothing. It was a Thursday. Like any other Thursday in his life except for one detail. Her. He touched his knees softly as if they were still bruised, and tears began to flow down his cheeks. Silent sobs turned into deep gasping cries and he held his head like a little boy and rocked. Just rocked until he couldn’t feel. A destination that never came. He would always feel. He would always hurt. He realized that it wasn’t a key he had so suddenly reached for. It was a ring. His ring. The pain was indescribable. It was him. In him. Around Him. The hopes that had filled his future were only distant memories of what could never be. It was on a Thursday, that terrible day, when he had zipped the last zipper on the last of her bags and for the last time made sure her car was full of gas. The moments that he lived, they lived, we lived were dead moments. When crying doesn’t help, when begging has no end, when logic yields no result. The death of a life is the worst thing he thought grimly. I will always love you Christopher. She had said, what did that even mean? It had to be meaningless. Logically that made no sense but there it was. Death with a velvet bow. A final torturous kiss. The simple lies that keep the dream alive. He looked around the room and noticed a little boy in the doorway. His baby blue footie pajamas, adorned with stars, were a stark contrast to the black doorway beyond the hall and he seemed to shine. Aston held his breath and asked a question that was hidden somewhere inside a locked box in his mind. James? Baby boy, is that you? The little boy didn’t answer and instead he just slowly faded away until all that was left was the imprint his little feet had left on the carpet. Aston didn’t know why he wasn’t scared. He knew that anyone else would, and should, feel terrified by what he had just seen. They just didn’t understand. In a strange way it was comfort. To him it was peace. He smiled and reached to pull the chain on the bedside lamp. Cththrk. The little room was bathed in the golden light that man so prizes and he pivoted, slipping his feet into the house shoes on the floor. That was one thing that he liked about her memory. Houseshoes. He pushed that out of his head. What time is it? He wondered sleepily and turned the bedside clock towards him. He turned it away every night because the light would keep him awake and it bothered him to see green through his eyelids. 08:14 AM. Read the little led display. He groaned and fell back into bed for a moment. Thursday. He really had to get up. There was a lot to do and he had yet to decipher the message. It would be best to get that done. He had time but not much of it. With a final sigh he slid out of bed and began dressing for the day.",

He wasn’t a laughing man but if he had been that would have made him positively chortle.

Ellis island, just a processing center for immigration into mainland America, was the next stop on his long journey and he was anxious to be onland. The ship had taken on some water and, had there been no sump pump, would surely have been more of a burden; however, the day had been saved. The young genius had saved the day the young genius named Nikola Tesla. He turned to see a young woman leaning on the rail, she appeared to be irish or perhaps welsh. Not an unattractive woman he thought to himself. She was soon joined by a father and two brothers which caused Nikola’s attention to waver, but only slightly. It was the logistics of the thing more than the principle. He turned back to the land in the distance. It was said to be a land of opportunity, and coming from his austrian background, he could see the promise. There was wealth and the chance to change things. He longed to strike out and make a name for himself without the stigma of having not attended college. He made his way to the back of the boat to see the things the others were missing. While they looked forwards he pensively looked back for a moment to take it in. The ocean empty behind them and only land ahead. \n    Upon disembarking Tesla was immediately met by Charles Rasterson, an associate of the famous Thomas Edison who eagerly welcomed him to the country and to New York. “Good trip?” Asked the man.

Are you here on business? the man inquired, glancing at his passenger in the slightly smaller than usual rear view mirror. I suppose you could say that. He hadn’t really considered that this would be a business venture. He thought of if more as research. “I am here in a research capacity in association with the University of Columbia in America”.

      "text": "Arthur let the memory take him back. Back to the year when it all began, 1879. Professor Bell was by far one of the most distinguished men in all of Europe, of that Doyle was quite certain. The oddity was that he was also one of the most selfish. He was an enigma. A cowboy of sorts like he belonged in a separate time. His eyes were of a deep hazel green. Piercing eyes that were somehow gentle at the same time. As if they were as meek as a lamb yet as sharp as daggers with the secrets of a thousand suns and two planets at rest between them. He was a career-long bachelor and unlike many of his time he seemed to be okay with that. Their sadly short tenure as partners in this secret plan began on that first day on the coast and had ended in Switzerland on a cold winter day. He had seen something that day that he saw every night before bed. He saw it as if it were tattooed on the back of his eyelids. Two men locked in a vicious struggle atop a cliff. The roaring waves and pounding boom of the falls and the spray of water on his face. If he had only gone up the left-hand path he would have been in time. Surely he could have been in time. But time had run out. He could never admit what he had seen. Truth be told he barely knew what it was. One moment Bell and his assailant were wrestling and punching each other. It looked like Bell had the upper hand but Arthur wondered if he only told himself that in order to feel better. They were fighting over a small metal object slightly larger than the size of a cuban cigar with an oblong end shaped like a taurus. Doyle remembered shouting up to him in anger and gesticulating frantically and uselessly to stop the man from pushing his friend over the precipice. But then, and it happened in a moment, a flash of brilliant green light sparked into the air like lightning and the two men fell apart in surprise. The small piece of metal hovered in the air between them and began to glow. It got brighter and brighter, so very bright. The light hurt. It stung like something out of a dream. The prickling of his skin made the hair stand up on end. Doyle had seen Bell turn towards him as if in a moment of recognition, some moment of intellect, and light so bright it cast shade cut the scene in tatters. Doyle could remember only pieces from there. A strong pulse in the air that reminded him of a beach before a storm, and the cracking sound of a horse-whip. He was knocked to the ground by an unseen force and the world went mercifully dark.\n",

      "text": "The Reichenbach Falls (German: Reichenbachfälle) are a waterfall cascade of seven steps on the stream called Rychenbach in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland.[1] They drop over a total height of about 250 metres (820 ft).[2] At 110 metres (360 ft), the upper falls, known as the Grand Reichenbach Fall (German: Grosser Reichenbachfall), is by far the tallest segment and one of the highest waterfalls in the Alps, and among the forty highest in Switzerland.[3] The Reichenbach loses 290 metres (950 ft) of height from the top of the falls to the valley floor of the Haslital.[1] Today, a hydroelectric power company harnesses the flow of the Reichenbach Falls during certain times of year, reducing its flow.[4][5]\n\nIn popular literature, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave the Grand (or Great) Reichenbach Fall as the location of the final physical altercation between his hero Sherlock Holmes and his greatest foe, the criminal Professor Moriarty, in \"The Final Problem\". \n\nLocation\n\nThe falls are located in the lower part of the Reichenbachtal, on the Rychenbach, a tributary (from the south bank) of the Aare. They are some 1.5 km (0.93 mi) south of the town of Meiringen, and 25 km (16 mi) east of Interlaken. Politically, the falls are within the municipality of Schattenhalb in the canton of Bern.[1][4]\n\nThe falls are made accessible by the Reichenbach Funicular. The lower station is some 20 minutes walk, or a 6-minute bus ride, from Meiringen railway station on the Brünig railway line that links Interlaken and Lucerne.[4][1] \n\nArthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories\n\nThe town and the falls are known worldwide as the setting for a fictional event: it is the location where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's hero, Sherlock Holmes, fights to the death with Professor Moriarty, at the end of \"The Final Problem\", first published in 1893. A memorial plate at the funicular station commemorates Holmes, and there is also a Sherlock Holmes museum in the nearby town of Meiringen.[6]\n\nOut of many waterfalls in the Bernese Oberland, Reichenbach Falls seems to have made the greatest impression on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was shown them on a Swiss holiday by his host Sir Henry Lunn, the founder of Lunn Poly. Sir Henry's grandson, Peter Lunn, recalled, \"My grandfather said 'Push him over the Reichenbach Falls' and Conan Doyle hadn’t heard of them, so he showed them to him.\" So impressed was Doyle that he decided to let his hero die there.[6]\n\nThe actual ledge from which Moriarty fell is on the other side of the falls from the funicular; it is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque as illustrated here; the English inscription reads: \"At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891.\" The pathway on which the duel between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty occurs ends some hundred metres away from the falls. When Doyle viewed the falls, the path ended very close to the falls, close enough to touch it, yet over the hundred years after his visit, the pathway has become unsafe and slowly eroded away, and the falls have receded further back into the gorge.[6] ",

      "text": "Irene Adler, is a fictional character in the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A former opera singer and actress, she was featured in the short story \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", published in July 1891. Adler is one of the most notable female characters in the Sherlock Holmes series, despite appearing in only one story. While not technically a criminal and bearing no malice towards Holmes, she outsmarts him and evades his traps. Sherlock Holmes refers to her afterward respectfully as \"the Woman.\"[1][2]\n\nIn the original Doyle story, Watson notes Holmes has no romantic interest in Adler or in women in general, pointing out the detective only exhibits a platonic admiration for her wit and cunning.[1] Despite this, some derivative works reinterpret Adler as a romantic interest for Holmes or as a former love who later regularly engages in crime.[3] \nIrene Adler appears only in \"A Scandal in Bohemia\". Her name is briefly mentioned in \"A Case of Identity\", \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\", and \"His Last Bow\".\n\nAccording to \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Adler is born in New Jersey in 1858. She has a career in opera as a contralto, performing at La Scala in Milan, Italy, and a term as prima donna in the Imperial Opera of Warsaw, Poland, indicating she is a talented and skilled singer. In Poland, she becomes the lover of Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and King of Bohemia (then only the Crown Prince), who was staying in Warsaw for a period. The King describes her as \"a well-known adventuress\" (a term widely used at the time in ambiguous association with \"courtesan\"[4][5]) who has \"the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men.\" Adler is trained as an actress and \"often\" disguises herself as a man to \"take advantage of the freedom which it gives.\" The two keep their relationship a secret, but exchange letters and have a photograph taken together that Adler keeps. The King returns to Prague, while Adler, now in her late twenties, retires and moves to London.\n\nIn 1888, the 30-year-old King intends to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. Learning of this, Adler promises if he officially announces the betrothal then she will send their photograph to his fiancée's family, a dangerous act since the Scandinavian royal family will consider it a scandal for the King of Bohemia to have been romantically involved with an actress of the lower classes. The king sends agents to retrieve the photograph, but multiple attempts fail.\n\nOn 20 March, the King asks the famous detective Sherlock Holmes to secure possession of the photograph. A disguised Holmes traces Adler's movements, noting she is \"a lovely woman, with a face a man might die for.\" While disguised, he discovers Adler is in a relationship with Godfrey Norton, an English lawyer, and witnesses the two make a hasty marriage. Spotting the disguised Holmes, Adler asks him to be the wedding's official witness and gives him a sovereign coin for his trouble.\n\nLater, Holmes disguises himself as an elderly cleric and uses trickery to gain access to Adler's home and learn where the photograph is hidden. Satisfied, he leaves. Adler concludes the cleric is really Holmes, whom she was warned about. Disguising herself as a young man, she visits Holmes' address of 221B Baker Street. Seeing John Watson with the same cleric she met earlier, she wishes them good night as she walks past them.\n\nThe next morning, Holmes visits Adler's home with Watson and the King to retrieve the photograph. Adler is gone, along with her new husband and the photo, leaving behind a photograph of herself alone as well as a letter written to Holmes explaining how she saw through his trick and confirmed her suspicion. The letter further explains that after making her threat to the King she met her new husband and is happy with him, meaning she no longer intends to compromise the King (though she is keeping the photo to protect herself against any further action). Admiring Adler, the King remarks it is \"a pity that she was not on my level.\" When offered a reward by the King for his efforts, Holmes asks for the photograph Adler left behind. Watson notes that Holmes keeps the photograph in his desk afterward and adds Adler's sovereign coin to his watch chain. Watson also notes that Holmes holds no romantic affection or attraction to Adler, yet holds her in great respect and often refers to her afterward by the respectful title of \"the Woman.\"\n\nIn the opening paragraph of the short story, Watson calls her \"the late Irene Adler\", suggesting she is deceased. It has been speculated, however, that the word \"late\" might actually mean \"former\" and is a reference to her changing her last name after marrying Godfrey Norton. Doyle employs this same usage of the word \"late\" in \"The Adventure of the Priory School\" in reference to the Duke's former status as a cabinet minister.\n\nIn \"The Five Orange Pips\", Holmes says he has \"been beaten four times – three times by men and once by a woman.\" If this woman is Adler, this contradicts the timeline of the stories. \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" takes place \"on the twentieth of March, 1888\"; \"The Five Orange Pips\" takes place before this in \"the year '87.\" Doyle's stories contain several minor contradictions and unclear points, including the location of Watson's war injury, how many times Watson is married, and the first name of Professor James Moriarty. \nAdler's career as a theatrical performer who becomes the lover of a powerful aristocrat had several precedents. One is Lola Montez, a dancer who became the lover of Ludwig I of Bavaria and influenced national politics. Montez is suggested as a model for Adler by several writers.[6][7]\n\nAnother possibility is the actor Lillie Langtry, the lover of Edward, the Prince of Wales.[6] Writing in 1957, Julian Wolff, a member of the literary society The Baker Street Irregulars, comments that it was well known that Langtry was born in Jersey (she was called the \"Jersey Lily\") and Adler is born in New Jersey.[5] Langtry had later had several other aristocratic lovers, and her relationships had been speculated upon in the public press in the years before Doyle's story was published. Another suggestion is the dancer Ludmilla Stubel, the alleged lover and later wife of Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria.[8] ",

      "text": "Archduke Johann Salvator of Austria (German: Johann Salvator, Italian: Giovanni Salvatore; 25 November 1852 – declared dead in absentia 2 February 1911) was a member of the Tuscan branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. He was Archduke and Prince of Austria, Prince of Hungary, Bohemia and Tuscany. After renouncing those titles, he was known as Johann (John) Orth. He disappeared while sailing with his wife in July 1890 and is believed to have died when his ship encountered a storm near Cape Horn. Salvator was declared dead in absentia in February 1911. \nEarly life\n\nJohann Salvator was born in Florence, the youngest son of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his second wife, Princess Maria Antonia of the Two Sicilies. He was baptized in Florence's Battistero di San Giovanni as Giovanni Nepomuceno Maria Annunziata Giuseppe Giovanni Batista Ferdinando Baldassare Luigi Gonzaga Pietro Alessandrino Zanobi Antonino.[1] He pursued a career in the Austrian Army and was a good friend of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, with both sharing liberal opinions.[2]\n\nAfter Bulgaria was granted autonomy by the Ottoman Empire, Johann Salvator was an unsuccessful candidate for the throne.[3] Prince Alexander of Battenberg would be elected Prince of Bulgaria in 1879. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of the Ottoman territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, he was put in command of a division of the occupying army and won numerous honours.[4][5]\n\nOn 16 October 1889, he resigned his army commission and renounced his title and the privileges he enjoyed as a member of the Austrian Imperial Family.[6] After renouncing his titles he assumed the name \"Johann (or John) Orth\", the surname Orth derived from the name of a castle he had owned, Schloss Orth. \n\nDisappearance\n\nIn 1889, Johann Salvator married Ludmilla (\"Milli\") Stubel, an opera dancer in London.[7] Shortly after his marriage, he purchased a ship named the Santa Margareta, on which he and his wife sailed for South America. In February 1890 he set off from Montevideo, Uruguay, heading for Valparaíso in Chile.[8] He was last seen on 12 July in Cape Tres Puntas, Argentina. It is believed that his ship was lost during a storm off the coast of Cape Horn.[9] He was officially declared dead on 2 February 1911 in Vienna.[10][11]\n\nIn the years following Salvator's disappearance, numerous sightings of him were reported. Rumors persisted that he and his wife sailed to South America and assumed new identities.[2] Several men also came forward claiming to be the \"missing Duke\". One of the more publicised claims came in May 1945 when a German born lithographer living in Kristiansand, Norway named Alexander Hugo Køhler made a deathbed confession claiming that he was Johann Salvator. Køhler claimed that, as Johann Orth, he \"bought\" the identity of Alexander Hugo Køhler and assumed his life. Køhler claimed that the real Alexander Hugo Køhler posed as Salvator and it was he who died at sea.[12] ",

      "text": "A\n* Alan Abel reported his own death in a skiing accident as an elaborate hoax on New Year's Day, 1980, to get his obituary published in The New York Times.[6] Abel died on September 14, 2018.[7]\n￼\n\nAli Hassan al-Majid (2004)\n* Ali Hassan al-Majid was supposed dead in April 2003, after British and United States officials reported that he had died in an air strike in Basra; al-Majid had been seen going into the building that was attacked, and corpses of his bodyguards were positively identified, though there was less certainty about the identity of al-Majid's supposed corpse. After obituaries of the Iraqi general, politician and first-cousin of Saddam Hussein were published in many newspapers, reports then circulated that he had escaped by boat, and subsequently been seen joking with staff in a hospital in Baghdad. Al-Majid was captured several months later, and sentenced to death in 2007 for war crimes.[8] He was hanged on January 25, 2010.\n* Rex Alston, a retired BBC sports commentator, garnered the unusual distinction of having his marriage announced in The Times the year after that paper had published his obituary, when his internal obituary file was updated and accidentally published in 1985. Alston was 84 at the time and lived another nine years until his actual death at 93 in 1994.[9]\n* Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, terrorist leader of ISIL, was erroneously reported dead, injured or arrested numerous times over a number of years by various governments, in media, and on Wikipedia, before his death in 2019.\nB\n* Arkady Babchenko, a Russian journalist living in Ukraine was widely reported on May 29, 2018, to have been shot dead.[10] A day later, Babchenko appeared at a press conference with the Security Service of Ukraine, claiming to have staged his death to expose Russian agents.[11]\n* Lawrence Joseph Bader, an Akron, Ohio, kitchenware salesman who faked death by drowning. On May 15, 1957, he left his wife Marylou (five months pregnant) their three kids, and five years of unpaid income taxes, sailing out on Lake Erie, and vanished (right after increasing his life insurance policy). His boat was found abandoned, and the Coast Guard announced that no one could have survived. In 1960, he was pronounced dead. He turned up in Omaha, Nebraska as married broadcaster John \"Fritz\" Johnson. He was found by his 21-year-old niece, and caught when his fingerprints matched those of Lawrence Bader; \"Johnson\" insisted the rest of his life that he had no recollection of his life as Bader. He died of a tumor in 1966; the cancer, which had caused his eye to be removed in 1964, may have preexisted before then and caused genuine amnesia.[12][13]\n* William Baer, a New York University professor, was declared dead by his New York Times obituary in May 1942 as a hoax by his students.[14][15]\n* Bill Bailey: The BBC website reported the death of the British comedian in May 2016, getting his age incorrect in the report. In a 2018 appearance on the BBC's The Graham Norton Show, Bailey suggested that the report was the result of confusion following the death of a DJ in Kentucky also named Bill Bailey.[16]\n￼\n\nLuca Barbareschi\n* Scott Baio: A hoax report circulated via e-mail claimed that this American actor had died in a car accident on December 18, 1997. The report was picked up by some media outlets, even causing several members of Baio's family to briefly believe he was dead.[17]\n* Josephine Baker: The entertainer was reported in 1942 to have died in Morocco of a \"lingering illness\".[18] The reports were later disproven;[19][20] Baker died in 1975.\n* Luca Barbareschi was one of four actors who the Italian police believed had been murdered while making the 1980 horror film Cannibal Holocaust. The film was so realistic that shortly after it was released its director, Ruggero Deodato, was arrested for murder. The actors had signed contracts to stay out of the media for a year in order to fuel rumours that the film was a snuff film, and the court was only convinced they were alive when the contracts were cancelled and the actors appeared on a television show as proof. Barbareschi is still alive, aged 65, as of 2022.[21][22]\n* Sabine Baring-Gould, English author, had his obituary published in The New York Times on June 5, 1906;[23] Baring-Gould died in 1924.\n* Bob Barker, former host of The Price is Right, has been the subject of many various false death reports. On a 1995 episode of Price[episode needed], he revealed that he was believed to have died while discussing its then-concurrent syndicated spinoff, which was being cancelled at the time. Shortly after he retired in 2007, more premature obituaries appeared announcing his death, but he appeared on three episodes that were hosted by Drew Carey (2009, 2013 and 2015). As of 2022, Barker is still alive.\n* Mandela Barnes, a former member of the Wisconsin State Assembly and the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin in the 2018 election for governor and lieutenant governor in Wisconsin, was erroneously reported as having been killed in a motorcycle crash north of Milwaukee. The error was caused by a photo of Barnes incorrectly being broadcast by the CBS affiliate in Milwaukee during a local news report about a different person being killed in a motorcycle crash.[24]\n* P. T. Barnum's premature obituary was published, unusually, not because of deception or error, but sympathy. When he took to his deathbed, Barnum expressed the wish that he might read what the papers would say about him. The New York Evening Sun obligingly printed his obituary on March 24, 1891, two weeks before his actual death on April 7. The newspaper acknowledged to its readers that Barnum was still alive at the time of publication.[25]\n* Edward Bartlett was reported in the 1934 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to have died \"about February\" the previous year. In fact, he lived until December 21, 1976.[26]\n* John Basedow was reported by PRWeb to have died in Thailand due to the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake; the story was quickly retracted.[27]\n* Charles Baudelaire, a French poet, was reported to have died by Paris newspapers in April 1866, after suffering a massive stroke while in Belgium.[28] He died the following year.\n* Beyoncé: On February 23, 2015, a fake news report surfaced on Twitter claiming that the singer was killed in a car crash. The report caused the hashtag #RIPBeyonce to become trending on Twitter.[29] As of 2022, Beyoncé is still alive.\n* Lal Bihari is the Indian founder of the Uttar Pradesh Association of Dead People, an organisation which highlights the plight of people in Uttar Pradesh who are incorrectly declared dead by relatives in order to steal their land, usually in collusion with corrupt officials. Bihari himself was officially dead from 1976 to 1994 as a result of his uncle's attempt to acquire his land. Among various attempts to publicize his situation and demonstrate that he was alive, he stood for election against Rajiv Gandhi in 1989 (and lost). He was awarded the Ig Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for his 'posthumous' activities.[30][31]\n* Biz Markie, rapper known for his 1989 single \"Just a Friend\". In December 2020, it was reported that Markie was staying in a rehabilitation facility as a result of a stroke he had suffered after going into a diabetic coma. On July 1, 2021, rumors of his death circulated on Twitter. His representative told Rolling Stone, \"The news of Biz Markie's death is not true, Biz is still under medical care, surrounded by professionals who are working hard to provide the best healthcare possible.\" Markie died at a Baltimore hospital fifteen days later, on July 16, at age 57.[32]\n* Jack Black. On June 4, 2016, the Twitter page of Black's band Tenacious D announced the actor and musician's death. However, the next day both Black and bandmate Kyle Gass clarified that the page was hacked and that Black was alive and well.[33]\n* Paul Blais, a US Air Force senior airman, was listed as one of 19 people believed killed in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. However, it transpired that he was alive, though in a coma, having been confused with another airman who had died.[34]\n* Rudy Boesch: the Navy SEAL best known for his appearances on the U.S. reality competition Survivor was falsely reported dead in August 2019. Boesch, who was in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease at the time, died three months later.[35]\n* Lucien Bouchard: the former Quebec premier (who had been seriously ill) was reported dead by CTV in September 2005. The network began broadcasting a live tribute to the politician, but cut it short with a sheepish confirmation that he was in fact alive, blaming a report from Radio-Canada for the error. However, Radio-Canada had never reported that Bouchard had died, and quickly sent out a press release insisting on an apology. CTV later retracted the statement blaming Radio-Canada, without ever confirming how they themselves had come to make the mistake.[36]\n* Peter Boyle, TV and movie character actor, was briefly and incorrectly declared deceased in October 1990, a few weeks following a massive stroke where he was almost paralyzed and could not move or speak for nearly six months. His incorrect lifespan of 1933–1990 is listed in the book Cult Movie Stars by author Danny Peary.[37] Boyle made a complete recovery from the blood clot in his brain and continued acting despite multiple and persistent health problems, including high blood pressure. He had another brush with death in 1999 when he suffered a heart attack while working on the set of the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, but he again recovered and was working again within one week. Boyle died on December 12, 2006.\n* James Brady, White House Press Secretary, was shot in the head in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Three hours later, amid confusion about the extent of his injuries, all three U.S. broadcast TV networks erroneously announced that Brady had died,[38] triggering an on-air outburst by ABC News anchor Frank Reynolds when the information was revealed incorrect.[39] This led to greater subsequent caution about issuing death reports during rapidly developing situations.[40] Brady died on August 4, 2014, 33 years after the shooting. His death was ruled homicide, since it was ultimately caused by his injury.\n* Gordon Brown: Following the death of footballer Gordon Banks on February 12, 2019, Sky News presenter Adam Boulton erroneously reported that the former prime minister of the United Kingdom had died. Boulton corrected himself a few seconds later.[41]\n* Adam Buckley: The resident of Santa Clarita, California, who had schizophrenia, went missing in June 2018. On July 2, a burned body was found in Lancaster, and the Los Angeles County Coroner misidentified the body as being Buckley's. In late August, the Coroner released a statement saying that they had misidentified the body, and Buckley was found alive on September 14.[42][43]\n* Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria, has been the subject of persistent rumors that he had died and been replaced by a body double after experiencing ill health in 2017. Buhari, 74 years old at the time, suspected the false rumors were ginned up and revived in 2018 by opposing politicians seeking the office in the 2019 presidential election.[44]\n* Rodger Bumpass (voice actor), reported in August 2006 to have died during heart surgery, by Jonesboro, Arkansas station KAIT, the Internet Movie Database, and Arkansas State University's newsletter.[45]\n* John Burney: Shortly after the collapse of his business, this resident of Helena, Arkansas disappeared on June 11, 1976. He was eventually declared dead, which allowed both his wife and his company to receive life insurance benefits. However, Burney resurfaced in December 1982 when he visited his father who had recently been injured in an accident. In the intervening years, Burney had taken up residence in Key Largo, Florida under the name John Bruce and had married a second wife without ever divorcing his first one. He was eventually convicted of fraud.[46]\n* Pat Burns, a NHL coach was reported to have died from cancer on September 17, 2010, by the Toronto Star. He actually died two months later on November 19.\n* Steve Burns, host of children's show Blue's Clues, was rumored to have died from a drug overdose in 1998; others claimed that Burns was struck and killed by a car. Burns went on The Rosie O'Donnell Show to debunk those rumors.[47]\n* Barbara Bush, former First Lady of the United States, had a draft obituary (conspicuously marked \"DO NOT PUBLISH\") leaked by CBSNews.com on April 15, 2018, after her family announced that she was in failing health and ending further medical treatment.[48] The following day, a fake news Web site pretending to be CNN.com falsely claimed Bush had died.[49] Bush died one day after that on April 17.\n* George H. W. Bush was erroneously reported dead in an e-mail by WBAP-AM/WBAP-FM, due to a false tip. At the time, Bush was in intensive care recovering from illness.[50] The German magazine Der Spiegel erroneously published a draft obituary for Bush on December 30, 2012, during his recovery from the same illness.[51] Bush had previously been the subject of another near-miss while President, when CNN Headline News almost reported a false tip stating Bush had died.[52] Another death hoax circulated in July 2014, when it was reported that Bush had died from food poisoning.[53] Bush died on November 30, 2018.\n* Either George H. W. Bush or his son George W. Bush, when the moving banner headline on South African television's ETV News read \"George Bush is dead\". A technician who was testing the banner accidentally pressed the \"broadcast live for transmission\" button, according to the BBC.[54] George H. W. Bush died on November 30, 2018, while George W. Bush is still alive as of 2022.\nC\n* Janelle Cahoon: in December 2005, the Duluth News Tribune claimed that the Benedictine nun's funeral had been shown in a 1999 documentary. The mistake caused much amusement at her monastery, with some sisters asking her what heaven was like, and others referring to the incident as \"Dead Nun Walking\".[55]\n* Mark Calaway (professional wrestler better known as The Undertaker): On April 17, 2014, rumors claimed that Calaway was found dead in his New Mexico home.[56]\n* Carlos Camejo, a Venezuelan man declared dead in September 2007 after a traffic accident, revived during his autopsy. After making an incision in his face, examiners realized something was wrong when he started bleeding. \"I woke up because the pain was unbearable\", Camejo said.[57]\n* Graham Cardwell, a Lincolnshire dockmaster who disappeared in September 1998 and was assumed drowned. Eight months later he was discovered living in secret in the West Midlands. He claimed he had thought he was suffering from cancer (though had not sought medical attention) and wanted to spare his family the trauma of it.[58]\n* David Cameron, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, when David Bowie's death was announced in January 2016, a newsreader on Heart Radio Scotland accidentally announced that David Cameron had died.[59]\n* Feliberto Carrasco: this 81-year-old Chilean man woke up in his coffin at his own wake in January 2008. His family had found his body lying limp and cold, and assumed he must have died. While he was lying in his coffin, dressed in a suit and surrounded by relatives, his nephew saw him wake up, though did not believe it at first. Carrasco said he was not in any pain, and asked for a glass of water. His death had been announced on a local radio station, which issued a correction.[60]\n* Whitney Cerak: a student was thought to have died in April 2006 when a van from Taylor University collided with a tractor trailer, leaving five dead. Fourteen hundred people attended her funeral. Fellow student Laura Van Ryn was thought to have survived the accident, which left her in a coma and heavily bandaged. Suspicions were only aroused when during her gradual recovery in the hospital, Van Ryn started making strange comments and using names \"wrongly\"; her university roommate also reported that she did not appear to be Van Ryn. Weeks after the accident, when concerned hospital staff asked her her name, she wrote \"Whitney Cerak\", which was confirmed by dental records. The tragic mix-up appeared to have been caused by Cerak's and Van Ryn's somewhat similar appearance, and confusion at the crash scene.[61][62] Cerak co-wrote a book about her experience titled Mistaken Identity: Two Families, One Survivor, Unwavering Hope.[63]\n* Joshua Chamberlain: an American Civil War officer and Governor of Maine was shot through the hip and groin in the 1864 Siege of Petersburg, he was thought to be on the point of death, and so was reported dead by at least one newspaper (perhaps The New York Times). However, he gradually recovered in hospital. Chamberlain was shown the newspaper report 'when they thought he was able to take it', and reportedly 'got a great kick out of seeing his obituary'.[64] He died in 1914.[65]\n* Jackie Chan: On June 20, 2013, a false report claimed that the actor had been killed in an accident while filming a movie in Austria. Another hoax article that surfaced in September of that year had also reported the same thing.[66]\n* Karen Chandler: the 1950s singer from Rexburg, Idaho known for her hit song \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me\" was erroneously reported to be dead by the Los Angeles Daily News on October 27, 2010. She died a week later on November 3 at age 87.\n* Jan Chapman: The 'In Memoriam' segment of the 89th Academy Awards, on February 26, 2017, included Janet Patterson, a costume designer who died in 2016. However, the segment used a photo of Chapman instead, resulting in friends and family believing that she was dead.[67]\n* Dick Cheney: The former Vice President of the United States in the CNN.com incident. The draft obituary, which had been based on the Queen Mother's, described Cheney as 'Queen Consort' and the 'UK's favorite grandmother'.\n* Cher: When Margaret Thatcher died the Twitter hashtag \"#nowthatchersdead\" was misinterpreted as \"Now that Cher's dead.\"[68]\n* Winston Churchill: He suffered a stroke on January 15, 1965, and died on January 24. But on January 18, the CBC's Halifax station CBHT inadvertently broadcast a tribute that Lester Pearson had pre-recorded for transmission in case of Churchill's death. This led at least one radio station to report that Churchill had in fact died.[69]\n* Francesca Ciardi: see Luca Barbareschi\n* Arthur C. Clarke: science fiction writer, had his obituary published by the G.R.A.A. (Goddard Retirees and Alumni Association) newsletter in April 2000. The obituary says he died on February 10, 2000, and even specifies the cause of death as pulmonary fibrosis.[70] To date, no correction seems to have been published. Clarke died in 2008 of \"respiratory complications and heart failure\".[71]\n* Michael Cleveland: In October 2014, this 46-year-old man was taken to a hospital near Buffalo, New York after suffering a heart attack. A doctor declared him dead, but according to his wife he was clearly still breathing and responsive. Almost two hours passed before the doctor finally acknowledged that Cleveland was alive, and he died later that morning. As of October 2015, Cleveland's wife is involved in a lawsuit against the hospital.[72]\n* Hillary Clinton: On September 11, 2016, WABC-TV television news reported that the American politician and wife of former president Bill Clinton had died when she collapsed at a 9/11 memorial ceremony.[73] She was herself running for president at the time.\n* Bill Clinton: On December 24, 2020, the 42nd United States President was also the subject of a death hoax on Twitter with a tweet from The Reveal Report indicating he had died and their sources said his death would be made public soon. However, his wife Hillary sent Christmas wishes the same day to her followers on Instagram with no indication the former president had died.[74]\n* Colin Clive: According to Variety, the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph erroneously published an obituary for actor Colin Clive in 1937 after the death of a similarly named actor, Colin Chase. Clive himself died later that year at age 37.[75]\n* Kurt Cobain: The rock musician was reported dead by CNN (though he was in fact in a coma) after an overdose in Rome in March 1994, shortly before his actual death in April.[76]\n* Samuel Taylor Coleridge: In 1816 the writer heard his death mentioned in a hotel by a man reading out a newspaper report of a coroner's inquest. He asked to see the paper, and was told that \"it was very extraordinary that Coleridge the poet should have hanged himself just after the success of his play [Remorse]; but he was always a strange mad fellow\". Coleridge replied: \"Indeed, sir, it is a most extraordinary thing that he should have hanged himself, be the subject of an inquest, and yet that he should at this moment be speaking to you.\" A man had been cut down from a tree in Hyde Park, and the only identification was that his shirt was marked 'S. T. Coleridge'; Coleridge thought the shirt had probably been stolen from him.[77] Coleridge died in 1834.[78]\n* Jeffrey Combs (actor): was confused with a businessman named Jeffrey Coombs who was aboard hijacked American Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. Combs the actor was pronounced dead by news media outlets and had to announce publicly that he was still alive.\n* Sean Connery (actor): in an October 25, 1993 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, Connery described recent reports of his death as a result of confusion over the then-recent death of former Texas governor John Connally as well as rumours that Connery had recently undergone treatment for throat cancer.[79] Connery died on October 31, 2020.\n* Alice Cooper: in the early 1970s, Melody Maker magazine confused readers by publishing a satirical concert review of the rock musician in the form of a mock obituary. So many fans took it literally that Cooper had to issue a statement, reassuring them: \"I'm alive, and drunk as usual.\"[80]\n* Stephanie Courtney: The actress who plays Flo in commercials by Progressive Insurance was the subject of a death hoax. On May 27, 2014, it was falsely reported that she had been killed in a car crash.[81]\n* Ion Creangă: around 1884 he suffered a severe stroke and people thought he had died. Reading his obituaries in the newspapers, Creangă reportedly said: \"If this was to be the mourning I would have gotten after my death, I'm happy I haven't died yet, and so help God, may I die when people will care less about someone like me\". He lived five more years, dying on December 31, 1889.[82]\n* Russell Crowe: the actor was reported as dead on a Z-100 broadcast in New York City on June 10, 2010; this was later disproven by a representative for the actor.[83]\n* Johan Cruyff: widely considered one of the best Dutch football players ever, his death was falsely reported in August 2014 when De Volkskrant accidentally uploaded a test version of their mobile website.[84] He died on March 24, 2016, aged 68.\n* Delimar Vera Cuevas: this new-born girl was declared by police to have died in a Philadelphia house fire in 1997. Six years later her mother became suspicious when a girl at a birthday party she was attending bore similarities to her other children. Subsequent DNA tests proved the girl was Delimar. Local resident Carolyn Correa is thought to have started the fire in order to kidnap her. Police could not explain why they had originally declared Delimar dead, as no human remains had been found in the fire, which had not been intense enough to completely destroy a body.[85] The incident was dramatized in the 2004 film Little Girl Lost: The Delimar Vera Story.\n* Macaulay Culkin: In November 2014, a report circulated on the internet stating that the actor had been found dead in his New York City apartment. Culkin debunked the report by posting pictures of himself on Twitter, even poking fun at the hoax by writing a caption about \"the great things you can do when you're alive\".[86]\n* Miley Cyrus: On September 5, 2008, a false Reuters article spread around the web claiming that the singer and entertainer had died in a car accident. This incident, which was also reported by TMZ, was quickly debunked, as she performed in concert the following Friday.[87][88] A similar incident took place on November 16, 2008, when someone hacked into Cyrus' YouTube account and posted a video stating she died after being hit by a drunk driver.[89] On September 3, 2013, messages began circulating on Facebook claiming that Miley Cyrus had committed suicide due to \"traumatic stress\".[56]\nD\n* Aden Abdullah Osman Daar: in May 2007 the first President of Somalia was erroneously reported dead by news portal SomaliNet and other web sites. In reality, he was in a critical condition and on life support in a Nairobi hospital following a long illness. One source said Daar's daughter had 'assumed' he had died and had informed government officials; another blamed Nairobi medical sources. Daar died shortly afterwards on June 8, 2007.[90][91][92]\n* John Darwin: this British prison officer was presumed to have drowned in March 2002 when he disappeared while canoeing in the sea near Hartlepool. Despite a huge search operation, and the calm weather, only his paddle was found, followed weeks later by the wreckage of his canoe. An inquest declared him dead. However, in December 2007, Darwin walked into a London police station, announcing: \"I think I'm a missing person\", and claiming to have no memory of the past five years. Darwin's wife Anne, who had claimed his life insurance, says he turned up at their home in 2003 and lived in secret there and next door for three years. They also spent time together in Panama, where they planned to set up a hotel for canoeing holidays; she emigrated there shortly before Darwin reappeared. Both Darwin and his wife were subsequently convicted and imprisoned.[93]\n* Calvin Demarest: The pool player was incorrectly reported dead in an insane asylum in 1916 by The New York Times, which quickly retracted the claim, saying they had no idea how the error occurred.[94] Demarest actually died in 1925.\n* Thomas Dennison: after this 37-year-old Briton went missing in October 2007, a body that was found in Greater Manchester was identified by his parents and caseworker as his. After the funeral and cremation, police contacted Dennison's mother, saying they thought they had in fact found him alive and living rough in Nottingham some days earlier. To prove it, they asked her for three questions only Dennison would know the answer to; he subsequently phoned her, saying \"You've buried me\". The body bore an uncanny resemblance to Dennison—even with similar scars and leg ulcers—leading police to ask whether he had had a twin brother.[95][96]\n* Bob Denver: In the early 1960s, this American actor was reported to have died after being electrocuted when a radio fell into his bathtub. The false report apparently began as a rumor which was picked up by several media outlets. Denver later said in an interview that for years after this incident, he would often encounter people who were surprised to see him alive. Denver actually died in 2005 of complications from throat cancer.[17]\n￼\n\nGraffiti on Fats Domino's home from his rumored death during Hurricane Katrina.\n* Lord Desborough: In 1920, The Times confused the British politician with Lord Bessborough.[97] Lord Desborough died in 1945.\n* Henri Deterding: The British newspaper the Daily Mail mistakenly published the obituary of Deterding, the head of the oil company Royal Dutch Shell, on 27 June 1924, and the news was copied by The New York Times under the heading \"Henry Deterding dies at film show; Director General of the Royal Dutch Company Succumbs Suddenly in The Hague\".[98] Deterding died in 1939.\n* Jhulri Devi was officially declared dead in 1974 and chased off her farm by relatives in order to steal her land in Uttar Pradesh, India.

The text, which DiMaggio himself saw, had been prepared following newspaper reports that DiMaggio was near death, and was transmitted when a technician pressed the wrong button.[101] DiMaggio died in March 1999, 2 months after the report.\n￼\n\nDrusus Julius Caesar: A premature poem in his memory led to the poet's execution.\n* Celine Dion: On October 24, 2013, circulating messages designed to look like news headlines reported that the singer died.[56]\n* DMX: Rumors of the rapper's death spread on social media on April 8, 2021, after his friend, comedian Luenell, posted a memorial Instagram story insinuating that he had died.[102] DMX had been in a coma since he had a heart attack on April 2. Luenell later clarified that DMX had not yet been pronounced dead, and his manager Steve Rifkind confirmed that he was still alive but on life support.[103] DMX died the next day.[104]\n* Fats Domino: The musician was thought drowned during the Hurricane Katrina flooding that affected his Ninth Ward, New Orleans, neighborhood. After a few days, Domino reappeared, saying that he had evacuated to a friend's home in Baton Rouge.

The poet, who was seeking to replicate earlier success in a panegyric written after the death of Germanicus, was himself condemned to death by the Roman Senate for anticipating the death of the Emperor's son.[115]\n* Ian Dury: The English musician was pronounced dead on Xfm radio by Bob Geldof in 1998, possibly due to hoax information from a listener disgruntled at the station's change of ownership. The incident caused music magazine NME to call Geldof \"the world's worst DJ\".[116] Dury died in March 2000.\n* Danny Dyer: In January 2015, a hoax spread on Facebook claimed that the EastEnders actor had died at the age of 37. Dyer posted to Twitter to deny the rumor.[117]\n* Bob Dylan – in the early 1990s, BBC Radio 1 DJ Neale James noted that it was Dylan's birthday, and \"a shame that (Dylan) wasn't around to see it\".[118]\nE\n* Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was the subject of several false obituaries. First he was falsely reported dead by The Sun on May 4, 2017. The article was published on the internet after Queen Elizabeth II had called an emergency meeting to announce that the Duke was going to give up his royal engagements.[119] Then, on August 2, 2017, an unfinished article was accidentally published on The Daily Telegraph's website reporting his death, with its headline reading \"HOLD HOLD HOLD Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, dies aged XX\".[120][121] Later, in February 2019, a notice briefly visible on the website of the Hampshire County Council claimed he was dead; the council later apologized for the error.[122][123] Finally, on February 22, 2021, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the Duke's death, but the report was quickly retracted. At the time of the report, Prince Philip was in the hospital.[124] Prince Philip died on April 9, 2021, less than two months after the last report, and just two months before his 100th birthday.[125]\n* Guy Edwards was reported dead overnight on October 16, 2018, according to motorsports website Autosport. Subsequently, a former colleague of Edwards visited him in Ireland and confirmed he was still alive.[126]\n* Harry Elionsky was reported dead on October 13, 1918, during the 1918 flu pandemic. Several books list his death in 1918 as fact, including Hunting the 1918 flu: one scientist's search for a killer virus and The plague of the Spanish lady: the influenza pandemic of 1918–1919. Both repeat the error from the 1918 papers. He went on to set records for distance swimming into the 1920s,[127] and died in 1956.\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's death was erroneously announced in the Australian media in 1993 after a London-based Sky News employee saw an internal rehearsal for her future death (one of many conducted by the UK media over the years). Thinking it was for real, he phoned his mother in Australia with the 'news', who passed it on to the media.[128][129] The time-zone difference may have made it difficult for the Australian media to check the story during UK nighttime. The employee was dismissed for the mistake, but then won a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal.[citation needed] (Fragments of the Queen Mother's life history also appeared in several other world figures' premature obituaries in the CNN.com incident.) The Queen Mother died on March 30, 2002.\n* Queen Elizabeth II's death was announced on BBC WM on May 17, 2010. Host Danny Kelly played God Save the Queen, then announced that \"Queen Elizabeth II has now died.\" He was stopped by his producer, and later admitted that the announcement was meant as a joke: the Queen Elizabeth II who had died was a Facebook user who used the Queen's name. The chairman of Mediawatch-UK said in response, \"Because it's the Queen and they treated it like a big announcement, it makes things worse ... It's the BBC we are talking about here, and there's a certain expectation from them.\"[130] The Queen is still alive as of 2022 but the British Government regularly conducts an exercise known as Operation London Bridge to help prepare her funeral. Other Commonwealth realms have similar protocols. The Queen is referred to as \"Mrs Robinson\" during practice runs specifically to prevent premature obituaries.[131]\nF\n* Frederick Fane, cricketer, reported in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1956 edition as having died on December 9, 1954. The 1961 edition reported his real death, aged 85, on November 27, 1960, saying: \"Owing to a similarity of initials, Wisden reported his death when he was 79. The man concerned was Francis L. Fane, his cousin. By a coincidence, Mr Fane's father also once read his own obituary.\"[132][133][134]\n* Dorothy Fay (film actress, also called Dorothy Southworth Ritter), was declared dead in an August 2001 Daily Telegraph obituary. Mrs Ritter, who lived in a nursing home, had been taken to another room temporarily when a friend stopped by to visit.

Fender laughed off the false report at the time.[136] Fender died in 2006.\n* Will Ferrell (comedian), reported by iNewswire to have died in a paragliding accident on March 14, 2006. The press release was a hoax; Ferrell had never been paragliding.[137]\n* Terry L. Fergerson, a teacher from West Monroe, New York, US, was thought to have died in May 2006 when Terry L. Ferguson (differently spelled last name) was killed in a vehicle collision. When Fergerson arrived at work the following day, he found fellow teachers and students consoling each other over his death; various friends and relatives also thought he had died. It is not clear whether the confusion was made by them, local media or the police. In addition to their similar names, Fergerson and the real victim both drove red Chevy pickups and were of similar age. \"I don't know what the percentages are, I'm not a mathematician, but it's pretty far out\", Fergerson said.[138]\n* Lou Ferrigno: On May 29, 2014. Santa Barbara, California police claimed that Lou Ferrigno died in a car accident.[56]\n* Sebastiao Fidelis: a Brazilian man whose supposed body was identified by his wife and buried in 2001 after he had been missing for two months. A year later, he was found wandering in the area, having lost his memory.[139]\n* Gerald Ford (former US president) in the CNN.com incident. Ford died on December 26, 2006.\n* Rick Fox: The former professional basketball player was initially rumored as being among those who died in a helicopter crash that killed his teammate Kobe Bryant, Bryant's daughter Gianna, John Altobelli, and six others on January 26, 2020.[140] Erroneous reports that Bryant's three other children (Natalia, Bianka and Capri Bryant) were also among the deceased had progressed as far as ABC News; ABC News reporter Matt Gutman was suspended for passing along the false rumor as fact.[141]\nG\n￼\n\nMarcus Garvey died after reading his own obituary.\n* Zsa Zsa Gabor: In early 2011, many websites, including her English Wikipedia page[142] reported the death of Zsa Zsa Gabor. However, it was quickly revealed that she had not actually died, and that this was a hoax mistaken by several websites as fact. She died on December 18, 2016.\n* Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi) Although it was widely reported at the time that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had been captured or killed by NTC forces during the concluding stages of the Battle of Sirte on October 20, 2011, these reports appeared to be false due to the fact that shortly after his father and brother Mutassim were killed, the Libyan prime minister Mahmoud Jibril said that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had managed to escape and was on the run.[143]\n* S. Gandaruban: This Sri Lankan man living in Singapore faked his own death in 1987 and fled the country to escape creditors after his car rental business collapsed. He then arranged for a fake death certificate stating that he had been shot dead in crossfire. His brother and wife were convicted of their involvement. In 2007, he was charged with conspiring to claim extensive life insurance arising from the fake death.[144]\n* Gabriel García Márquez (writer), reported dead by Peruvian daily La República in 2000 shortly after being diagnosed with cancer.[145] A number of newspapers also published his alleged farewell poem, but García Márquez denied being the author of the piece and even went as far as to say that he was upset that people could think he wrote something so tacky. It soon emerged that the poem was actually written by a Mexican man, who commented that he did not think himself to be a great writer but still was upset that his poem had been attributed to someone else.[146] García Márquez underwent successful treatment for his cancer and lived long enough to write and publish the first volume of an autobiography.[147] He died of pneumonia on April 17, 2014, at the age of 87.\n* Marcus Garvey: After suffering a stroke in January 1940, the black nationalist read his obituary in the Chicago Defender which described him as \"broke, alone and unpopular\". Apparently as a result, Garvey suffered a second stroke and died.[2]\n* Gordon Gee: In March 2003 the then-Vanderbilt University president was declared dead by a fake edition of the university's student newspaper The Vanderbilt Hustler, sparking early dismissal from classes, tears, and moments of silence. Gee issued a press release confirming he was still alive. The hoax was perpetrated by staff from a separate student satirical magazine The Slant, whose managing editor would only say: \"I have the right to remain silent, and I am exercising my right of silence\".[148]\n* Ghazali Shafie, then Foreign Minister of Malaysia, was reported by The New York Times to have died in an aeroplane crash in 1982. Ghazali had in fact survived the crash, read his obituaries, and lived until 2010.[149][150]\n* Gabby Giffords: Giffords, a former member of the United States House of Representatives and a gun control advocate, has twice been the victim of a premature obituary. Giffords was one of numerous people shot during a meeting with constituents outside a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona on January 8, 2011.[151] Giffords sustained a serious gunshot wound to the head, but was not one of the six people immediately killed by the attack.[151] NPR erroneously reported that she had been killed, however, and that report was picked up and circulated by numerous other media outlets, including CNN,[152] Fox News Channel,[152] The New York Times,[152] and Reuters.[153] In February 2017, U.S. Representative Sean Duffy (R-WI) erroneously claimed in a CNN New Day interview that Giffords died in the 2011 mass shooting.[154]\n* Cookie Gilchrist: Gilchrist, a former fullback in the Canadian Football League and American Football League, was presumed dead by his hospice worker on January 8, 2011, and reported the news to his nephew, Thomas Gilchrist. However, upon laying him down, Cookie was revived. Gilchrist died two days later.[155]\n* Terry Gilliam: On September 8, 2015, the web site of the show business trade publication Variety briefly posted a premature obituary of director, animator, and Monty Python troupe member Terry Gilliam. Variety soon removed the post and apologized for the mistake; Gilliam followed by posting the message \"\"I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING DEAD especially to those who have already bought tickets to the upcoming talks, but, Variety has announced my demise. Don't believe their retraction and apology!\" on his Facebook page.[156]\n* Arnie \"Woo Woo\" Ginsburg (disc jockey and foley artist) was erroneously proclaimed dead in the local newspaper in Ogunquit, Maine where he resided at the time, a week before his actual death on June 26, 2020.[157]\n* Ruth Bader Ginsburg: On January 21, 2019 Fox News broadcast a \"1933–2019\" graphic announcing the death of the Supreme Court Justice.[158] Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020.\n* Jack Glasscock and Bill Gleason (19th century baseball players): The Reach Official American League Base Ball Guide for 1918 stated that \"[o]ne of the saddest and at the same time strangest coincidences of the past year was the killing and fatally wounding on December 21 of Jack Glasscock and Billy Gleason, both famous shortstops of the 80's.\"[159] According to Reach, Glasscock and Gleason died in separate car accidents on the same day in 1917, Glasscock in Lorraine, Ohio and Gleason in St. Louis, Missouri.[160] In fact, neither former shortstop had died that day; the Jack Glasscock who was killed in an accident was not the ex-baseball player, and Bill Gleason had been seriously injured but not killed.[161] Gleason actually died in 1932 and Glasscock in 1947, but the Reach Guide never printed a correction of its initial report of their deaths.[160]\n* Bill Gleason: See Jack Glasscock.\n* Nicephorus Glycas: in 1896, having presumably been declared dead, the Greek Orthodox bishop of Lesbos Island, awoke in his coffin after he had been lying in state for two days. He sat up and asked what mourners were staring at.[162]\n* Jeff Goldblum: On June 25, 2009, the same day actress Farrah Fawcett and musician Michael Jackson died, actor Jeff Goldblum was reported dead on Australia's Channel Nine news. The report was quickly debunked, and traced back to a hoax website.[163]\n* Roberto Gómez Bolaños: The well-known actor, known by the name \"Chespirito\", was reported dead in 2003 by a confused Chilean reporter (Carolina Zúñiga). Actually the dead person was a Chilean writer with a similar name (Roberto Bolaño). Chespirito died in 2014.[164]\n* Roger Goodell: The commissioner of the National Football League was subject to a death hoax on June 7, 2016, when hackers broke into the league's Twitter account and announced his death. Goodell was golfing with Jim Kelly at the time of the hoax.[165]\n* Harry Gordon: in 2000, this Australian businessman faked his own death in a boating accident so his wife could claim a fortune in life insurance, though he claimed it was to evade business and relationship problems. He assumed a new identity and fled to Spain, then to England (where he worked in a potato crisp warehouse), South Africa, and New Zealand. He explained gaps in his past to a new girlfriend by telling her he was on a witness protection programme. He was discovered in 2005 and later jailed when, his brother encountered him on a mountain path in New Zealand. Gordon published a book about his exploits, titled How I Faked My Own Death.[166]\n* Frank Gorshin (American actor; the Riddler from Batman): in 1957, after driving 39 hours without a break to avoid flying to a screen test, the actor fell asleep at the wheel and crashed. A Los Angeles newspaper reported him dead. Gorshin was unconscious for four days, and the role went to another actor.[167] Gorshin survived the crash, and resumed his career. Gorshin died in May 2005.\n* Jim Gosger: The still-alive alumnus of the New York Mets baseball team was erroneously included in an In Memoriam digital billboard display during a Mets game on June 30, 2019. Gosger was hurt by the appearances, as he had not been invited to the ceremonies and had never received his ring for his role in the 1969 World Series win. The same In Memoriam segment also erroneously listed a \"Jessie Hudson\" among the deceased; a Jesse Hudson (no I) had played for the Mets that year and is also still alive as of 2022.[168]\n* Gotye: In July 2012, CNN reported that the Australian indie rock singer committed suicide. The report was disproven by the singer himself, who replied on Twitter that he was in fact alive. CNN claimed the error was made by a \"fraudulent user\" of its iReport service.[169]\n* Robert Graves: the writer was left for dead in 1916 after receiving life-threatening injuries at the Battle of the Somme. He made a remarkable recovery, and read a report of his death in The Times.[170] Graves died in 1985, at the ripe old age of 91 years.\n* Ann Green (or Anne Greene), a servant in Oxfordshire, was hanged for allegedly murdering her newborn child in 1650. Having presumably been declared dead, her corpse was taken away for dissection, but she revived. She was ultimately pardoned, and became something of a celebrity.[171][172]\n* Catherine Sophie Greenhill, a British three-year-old who was pronounced dead after falling from an upper storey window onto flagstones in the late 18th century. However, she was revived by a Dr. (or Mr.) Squires, a member of the recently formed Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned (later the Royal Humane Society) using an early form of defibrillator. After a time in coma she eventually made a full recovery.[173]\n* Sasha Grey: In February 2015, it was reported that the actress had been captured and killed by Ukrainian military forces. Grey herself took to Twitter to dispel such rumors.[174]\n* Friedrich Gulda (pianist), who in 1999 faxed the Austrian News Agency claiming he had died of a stroke at Zurich Airport. Shortly afterwards he announced he was still alive and would be giving a 'Resurrection Recital', which was accompanied by go-go dancers (he often played pranks to annoy the musical establishment).[175] Gulda died in 2000.\n* Dominic Guzzetta: in November 2005, the former University of Akron president was reported by the Akron Beacon Journal to have been 'posthumously honored' at a fundraising event. Prior to this, he had joked for years that he reads the obituaries to make sure his name is not among them.[176]\nH\n* Gene Hackman: On January 27, 2015, a rumor spread on social media that actor Gene Hackman had died at the age of 85. The source stems from a career retrospective of his works that had been published on Grantland that day, whose headline referenced not his death, but his retirement from acting; and many readers who saw the article's headline assumed that he had died.[177]\n* Lincoln Hall: In 2006, Lincoln Hall was climbing up Mount Everest with a group of climbers, one of whom, Thomas Weber, had already died. Although Hall had made it to the summit, he was suffering from what was probably cerebral edema, and on the way down was abandoned for dead by his Sherpas, after beginning to hallucinate and refusing to move. When the rest of the expedition reached ground, the leader, Alexander Abramov reported Hall had died on the way down, and Hall's family was informed. However, the day after the event, Dan Mazur found Hall sitting on a ledge, 28,200 feet up, with no oxygen. Hall had survived the night in the fabled 'death zone,' near the top of Mt Everest. Hall died of mesothelioma in 2012 at his home in Australia.[178][179]\n* Tom T. Hall, American country singer, was mistakenly reported dead in 2015 with the death of his wife Dixie.[180] Hall died in 2021.\n* Matt Hannon (also known as Matt Karedas), American actor best known for the title role in Samurai Cop, was erroneously reported dead in 2006 in apparent confusion with Samurai Cop director Amir Shervan (possibly exacerbated by his name change). Hannon/Karedas came forward in 2014 stating he was alive and well, the next year reprising his role in Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance.[181]\n* Corinna Harfouch: the German actress was reported dead by a Swiss newspaper when she fell into a river during filming and was swept away. In fact, she survived and phoned her ex-husband, who had seen the obituary, from hospital to confirm that she was alive.[182]\n* Angelo Hays: the French Inventor and celebrity was in a motorcycle accident in 1937. The doctors were unable to find a pulse and Hays was declared dead. He was buried three days later in the village of St. Quentin de Chalais. Two days after the funeral, when Hays was exhumed for the purposes of an insurance investigation, forensic examiners were surprised to find that the body was still warm. They found that Hays had been in a coma resulting from his head injury; his body's diminished need for oxygen had allowed him to survive for two days underground.[183] Not only did he survive, but invented a withstanding coffin that he demonstrated twice. He died in 2008.\n* Jon Heder: an American actor, who was made famous by his role as Napoleon Dynamite, was rumored to have died in a car crash in 2005. Another rumor was that he died from an overdose. In an interview in March 2005 by Misty Harris of Canwest News Service, when asked about the rumors of his death, Heder said, \"Yeah, and apparently it's not true.\"[184]\n* Hugh Hefner: On July 11, 2011, the Playboy entrepreneur was reported dead of a heart attack.[185] Hefner died on September 27, 2017.\n￼\n\nErnest Hemingway and Mary Welsh Hemingway in Africa in 1954. Both were hurt in plane crashes during their trip and were reported dead.\n* Ernest Hemingway and Mary Welsh Hemingway: After the husband and wife authors were involved in two African plane crashes in 1954, newspapers reported that both had died. They survived, but Ernest Hemingway suffered extensive injuries which affected him for the rest of his life. AE Hotchner claimed that after the incident, Hemingway read a scrapbook of his obituaries every morning with a glass of champagne.[186] Ernest Hemingway committed suicide in 1961.[187] Mary Welsh Hemingway died in 1986.\n* Bill Henry (American baseball player): newspapers and the Associated Press reported him dead in August 2007 after the death of a similar-looking retired salesman of the same name. The dead man had claimed for decades that he was the retired sportsman—even to his wife and stepchildren—and had explained away discrepancies in his story, such as Bill Henry's date and place of birth on baseball cards, as printing errors. The fraud came to light when a genealogist investigated the incorrect date of birth published in the obituaries.[188] The real Bill Henry died in 2014.\n* Michael Heseltine: In 1994, then-DJ Chris Morris implied on BBC Radio 1 (as a prank) that the British politician had died. This led to an on-air tribute by fellow MP Jerry Hayes (during which Morris managed to make Hayes laugh inappropriately), and Morris' subsequent suspension.

In both cases a pre-written obituary of the entertainer was accidentally published on a news web site:\n    1. In 1998 his obituary appeared on the Associated Press web site, leading to the announcement of his death in the United States House of Representatives, broadcast live on C-SPAN.[194][195]\n    2. In the 2003 CNN.com incident. Hope's draft obituary, which had used the Queen Mother's as a template, described him as 'Queen Consort' and the 'UK's favorite grandmother'. Hope died just three months later due to age-related illnesses, aged 100.\n* Professor John Nicholas Peregrine Horden, a Fellow of All Souls' College Oxford.

In September 1995 a government press spokesman announced that Humphrey was presumed dead, as he had been missing since June. After the ensuing publicity, he was found to be alive and residing in the nearby Royal Army Medical College where he had been taken in as a stray. A statement was issued quoting Humphrey as saying: \"I have had a wonderful holiday at the Royal Army Medical College, but it is nice to be back and I am looking forward to the new parliamentary session.\"[198]\n    2. In November 1997, there were media allegations that Cherie Blair disliked the cat so much that she had had him killed; the government claimed he had merely gone into retirement away from the public spotlight. In Parliament, Alan Clark MP demanded that the government prove Humphrey was still alive. As a result, the government released photographs of Humphrey posing with the day's newspapers as proof.[199] Humphrey's actual death was announced by Tony Blair in March 2006.[200]\n* William Hung: in 2004, a satirical news report on the Broken Newz web site claiming that the American Idol contestant had died of a heroin overdose was widely believed, forcing Hung to issue a denial.[201]\n* Saddam Hussein, former President of Iraq, was reported dead in April 1980 by Radio Tehran.

Thirteen days after her funeral, Jackson showed up alive at a mental health facility.[205]\n* Chris Jericho: Wikipedia noted of Jericho's supposed death in April 2014. This was proven to be vandalism, and Jericho would jokingly tweet that he had died. Two months later, Wikipedia again listed Jericho as having died in June 2014. Jericho would tweet that he has unfortunately 'died again', referencing the first hoax.\n* Jiang Zemin: Amid internet rumors concerning his health, Hong Kong's Asia Television reported him dead on its 6 pm evening news broadcast on July 6, 2011. The next day, China's Xinhua News Agency dismissed reports of Jiang's death as \"pure rumor\", prompting ATV to retract its earlier report.[206]\n* Steve Jobs: On August 27, 2008, Bloomberg accidentally published a 17-page obituary. During a subsequent keynote address, Jobs joked about the accident by displaying on screen an imprecise quotation of Mark Twain (who was also the recipient of a premature obituary) reading \"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\".[207][208] Jobs actually died of pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56.\n* Pope John Paul II:\n    1. Immediately after the 1981 attempt on his life, despite heightened caution from CBS's embarrassing premature obituary of James Brady weeks earlier, CNN implied the Pope had died by repeatedly referring to him in the past tense.[40]\n    2. In 2003, by CNN again, this time in the CNN.com incident. The draft obituary, which had used the Queen Mother's as a template, noted the Pope's 'love of racing'.\n    3. On April 1, 2005, the day before his actual death, Fox News reported he had died after it received incorrect reports from the Italian media that his ECG had gone flat.[209]\n* Dwayne Johnson: The American actor was falsely reported dead on April 12, 2014, but Johnson posted a photo on Instagram of him working out at the gym, which disproved the story. The report was the same as Robyn Malcolm's death hoax—falling 60 feet down Kauri Cliffs in New Zealand. The initial report stated that Johnson was filming Fast and Furious 7 at the time, which has no scheduled filming in New Zealand. If the news was true, it would have been the second death during production, after Paul Walker's death in November 2013.[210]\n* Jay Jon: in September 2014, a 17-year-old Brooklyn-based rapper was the subject of a death hoax. A Facebook post claimed that he was found dead on a sidewalk shortly after releasing a music video, C.O.P., on YouTube.

(See also Lal Bihari.)[30]\n* Hiannick Kamba: The former footballer, once a prospect for Bundesliga club Schalke 04, was reported dead in a 2016 auto accident in his home country of DR Congo. In May 2020, the German newspaper Bild reported that Kamba, by then age 33, was alive and working for an energy company in Germany. In 2018, Kamba told German prosecutors that friends had taken his money, identification, and documentation in the wake of the accident, making it difficult to prove that he was alive. In the meantime, his now-former wife used reports of his death to receive a large insurance payout, apparently unknown to him. Upon the discovery of Kamba's survival, an insurance fraud investigation into the ex-wife was opened.[218]\n* George Kaye: in November 2005, the Irish musician was reported dead by the Daily Mirror following a plane crash.[219]\n* Ken Kesey: in 1966, the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest faked his own suicide in an attempt to escape drug charges.

His mother took him to the dentist and hospital for a full check-up, just to make sure. The club was sanctioned for bringing the game into disrepute.[228][229]\n￼\n\nA death hoax website reported false news of Lee Kuan Yew's death.\n* Xavier LaBelle was wrongly reported as one of the fatalities in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.

Spike Lee and others responded to this blunder via Twitter.[238]\n* Titan Leeds, publisher of an almanac competing with Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac. Franklin had repeatedly predicted that Leeds would die in 1733 in his almanac, and when the date of Leeds' supposed death had come and gone, published Leeds' obituary anyway.

Commenting on the incident, she said \"I thought it was hilarious — stuff happens.\"[242][243] Lewis died on February 7, 2021.[244]\n* Gordon Lightfoot, Canadian folk musician, was mistakenly reported dead by CBC Radio 3, Canwest and the Calgary Herald on February 18, 2010. The source of the rumour was a prank phone call to Ronnie Hawkins, a long time friend of Lightfoot's, by a man claiming to be the singer's grandson. Media outlets ran the story having confirmed with Hawkins. Lightfoot was in fact at the dentist at the time the story broke.[245]\n* Arthur Livingston, a then-36-year-old resident of Prosperity, South Carolina, was erroneously reported dead by his bank, Bank of America, when he sold his house in May 2009.

In January 2013, a hoax article claimed that he had died in a snowboarding accident in Switzerland. The same hoax was also recirculated in March 2014.[252]\n* Lonnie Mack, the rock guitarist best known as the founder of the blues-rock guitar genre, was lamented as recently deceased in the foreword to the 1997 book Rock Music in American Popular Culture. Although rarely seen in recent years, the notoriously reclusive Mack was still very much alive, and performed as a headliner at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as recently as November 15, 2008.[253] Mack died in 2016.[254]\n* Iven Mackay, an Australian general, received an obituary in The Times, entitled \"Athlete, Soldier and Headmaster\", as a result of a case of mistaken identity following the death of Major General James Alexander Kenneth Mackay in 1935.[255] Mackay died in 1966.\n* John Madden the Hall of Fame coach was reported dead on April 29, 2014, by Empire News, convincing many sports fans before being disproved.[256] Madden died December 28, 2021.\n* Nelson Mandela (South African leader) was reported as having died in an article on the Deutsche Welle website on June 14, 2013.[257] The site later blamed this on an unspecified \"technical difficulty\".[258] He was also one of those whose obituaries were released in the CNN.com incident. Mandela died on December 5, 2013.\n* Charles Manson: On May 15, 2015, a fake news website reported that the notorious criminal had been found dead in his prison cell.

He actually died in 1962.[261]\n* Jerry Maren, American actor best known as one of the Munchkins in the 1939 film version of The Wizard of Oz. Several news outlets, including the Examiner, cited social media reports that Maren, the last surviving Munchkin from the film, had died on February 29, 2016, but Maren appeared on social media (in what would be his last appearance) to disprove the reports.[262] Maren died on May 24, 2018, from a combination of old age-related diseases.[263][264]\n* Bam Margera: In May 2018, rumors briefly circulated that the skateboarding and reality TV icon was dead after wrestler Hulk Hogan posted a tribute to Twitter.

She subsequently made further phone calls masquerading as a hospice nurse, then as Matera's sister, claiming that Matera had died. The church arranged a memorial service—to which Matera showed up, again claiming to be her sister. Suspicions had already been aroused from the phone calls, in which the nurse and sister both sounded exactly like Matera. Police did not arrest her as no crime had been committed; she blamed her behaviour on childhood trauma.[268] Matera really did die a few years later on June 15, 2011.[269]\n* Mary Mather, a paediatrician who was reported dead in December 2004 by the General Medical Council after confusion with another person of the same name.[270]\n* Jerry Mathers: rumours that the Leave it to Beaver actor had been killed in Vietnam spread to newspapers by December 1969. (Claims that Associated Press and United Press International put out the story, and that it arose from confusion with the death of another soldier called Mathers, appear to be false.)[271]\n* Brian Matthew: On April 5, 2017, the BBC reported that the radio presenter had died the previous night.

He died on April 1, 2022.\n* Paul McCartney was proclaimed dead in 1969 by a caller to radio DJ Russ Gibb's show on WKNR-FM Detroit. A few days later New York DJ Roby Yonge was fired for discussing McCartney's possible death on a late-night show. These and other incidents led to interminable rumours that McCartney's supposed death (hinted at by a trail of supposed clues in various Beatles songs) had been covered up and he had been replaced by a look-alike.[276]\n* Mark McGrath, actor and lead singer of Sugar Ray, was the subject of a deliberate death hoax; to promote the TV series Hot Package, production company Prismatics issued a press release claiming McGrath had been shot to death during production of the show. (It was in fact his character that was killed off.)[277]\n* Sipho William Mdletshe, a South African man who was thought to have died in a 1993 traffic accident.

Miller, Jr.: After mysteriously disappearing and failing to pay child support, this Ohio man was legally declared dead in 1994. However, it turned out that Miller had simply left the state, and in 2013 he asked a judge to reverse the declaration of death so he could apply for a driver's license. The judge was unable to honor this request, as Ohio law states that a declaration of death cannot be reversed after more than three years have passed. As such, Miller remained legally dead as of October 2013. Further complicating the matter is the fact that Miller's ex-wife received Social Security benefit payments for their children for several years, and she might be required to return them if the declaration of death is reversed.[282]\n* Prasad and Mahaprasad Mishra (Indian brothers) were officially declared dead in 1979 by four nephews in order to steal their land in Uttar Pradesh. Although the nephews were forced to admit fraud, the case was mired in legal delays for many years.

Moody was quoted as saying: \"I'm bloody annoyed. Not only can it cause unhappiness, but it can affect your work. If people think you're dead they're not going to use you. Unless it's a kinky film.\" Moody died on June 11, 2015.\n* Peter Moran (British journalist) was reported dead in the December 2007 issue of aviation magazine FlyPast; he had previously contributed to the magazine for several years.

Murphy resolved to return to racing after reading his obituary in the Racing Post.[292]\n* Paul Mutora: In January 2014, this Kenyan man was declared dead after having swallowed insecticide to kill himself. However, morgue workers noticed movement in his body and discovered that he was in fact still alive.[293]\n* Levy Mwanawasa: On July 3, 2008, the Johannesburg-based 702 Talk Radio claimed that the President of Zambia had died in a Paris hospital while recovering from a stroke suffered 4 days before in Egypt. The government stated that the story was false.[294] Mwanawasa died 47 days later from complications of the stroke.[295]\nN\n￼\n\nAlfred Nobel bequeathed his fortune to institute the Nobel Prizes after reading a damning premature obituary\n* Jayaprakash Narayan: while hospitalized in March 1979, the politician's death was erroneously announced by India's prime minister, causing a brief wave of national mourning, including the suspension of parliament and regular radio broadcasting, and closure of schools and shops. The mistake arose when the director of the Intelligence Bureau saw a body looking like Narayan being carried from the hospital where he was undergoing treatment.[162] Narayan survived the incident, but died seven months later, in October 1979.\n* K. R. Narayanan: While hospitalized due to pneumonia and other age-related complaints on November 9, 2005, the veteran Indian politician, who was former President of India (1997-2002) was declared dead by the media.

Nelson later took to Twitter with a recently printed newspaper to dispel such rumors.[296]\n* Willie Nelson: On February 21, 2015, a fake news website reported that the legendary country singer had been found dead at his home. A similar hoax story surfaced in August of that year that proclaimed the same thing.[297]\n* Alfred Nobel (chemist and founder of the Nobel Prize): in 1888, the death of his brother Ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of Alfred in error.

Onoda—who was officially declared dead in 1959—only gave himself up in 1974 when his commanding officer, who had long since retired from the military and become a bookseller, was sent to the island to order Onoda to surrender.

Later that night, Onward State's managing editor Devon Edwards officially retracted the story, stating that \"In this day and age, getting it first often conflicts with getting it right, but our intention was never to fall into that chasm. All I can do now is promise that in the future, we will exercise caution, restraint, and humility.\" Devon also announced that he would immediately resign from his position as managing editor for Onward State.

His supposed death may also have been reported in The Times. (It is also sometimes said that by way of apology, The Times allowed Russell to pre-write his own obituary for publication on his actual death. But the obituary[353] does not read as if it could be by him; the confusion may be that in 1937 he wrote an imaginary Times obituary for his own entertainment, which is briefly quoted at the end of his obituary in The New York Times).[354] Russell died in 1970, over 50 years later.\nS\n￼\n\nRock musician Bob Seger, was the subject of a false obituary, after he was confused with folk music veteran Pete Seeger\n* Hugo Jose Sanchez: This British father-of-four was a web developer for HMV and faked his death to claim £850,000 and get his family out of poverty.

Others, apparently believing that Bob Seger was Pete Seeger's son, offered condolences to Bob on the loss of his father. The two singers were in fact of no known relation, and Bob Seger was very much alive and well.[364]\n* Katharine Sergava (Oklahoma! actress & dancer), whose obituary was published in 2003 in the Daily Telegraph and a few days later in The New York Times. The latter newspaper blamed the former for the mistake.[365] Sergava died November 26, 2005\n* William Seward After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, on April 15, 1865, many newspapers erroneously reported that William Seward and other members of Lincoln's cabinet had been killed, with the New York Herald reporting \"Washington was thrown into intense excitement a few minutes before eleven o'clock this evening, by the announcement that the President and Secretary Seward had been assassinated and were dead.\"[366] Seward died in 1872.\n* Rebekah Shelton, former Big Brother contestant, was reported to have died on January 12, 2018, following a message posted on her Twitter account.

His obituary inexplicably appeared three years before his death in 1911.[371]\n* Jaclyn Smith (Charlie's Angels actress & model) was reported to have shot herself in Honduras in 2009. The rumor began when a Honduran newspaper reported that her 'Angels' stunt double had shot herself, and several sites misread the news.

It was speculated that he may have died in a fire, and he was officially declared dead in 1986. However, in 2014, investigators found that Stan was alive and residing in Oklahoma under the name Jeff Walton. Relatives reported that Stan had a wife and children in Canada at the time of his disappearance, but in the intervening years he had apparently married another woman and started a family. His Oklahoman relatives reported that they had no knowledge of his previous identity. However, in a bizarre twist, at least one Canadian relative claimed to have known that Stan was alive all this time, and was shocked to learn that he had been declared dead.

Stephenson: On July 26, 2009, the AT&T CEO was falsely reported as having died after falling into a coma following a massive cocaine binge during a party at his mansion.[383] The report originated from CNN's iReport website, although it was later taken down. Although the hackers who created the false report have never been identified, it is suspected that they were 4chan users who did the hack in retaliation for AT&T's decision to block the site for its broadband customers, a decision which had been provoked by an earlier denial-of-service attack against one of AT&T's customers that originated from a 4chan user. Access to 4chan on AT&T broadband services has since been restored.\n* John Stonehouse MP: in 1974 the British politician faked his own death (by drowning in Miami) in order to escape financial difficulties and marry his mistress.

Tharoor tweeted in response \"We're getting condolence calls in the office! Reports of my demise are, if not exaggerated, at least premature.\"[392]\n* Margaret Thatcher: Text-message reports that \"Thatcher has died\" caused a stir at a 2009 Canadian political event, and officials in Prime Minister Stephen Harper's office had begun preparing a statement of condolence, until it was determined that the deceased Thatcher in question was actually Transport Minister John Baird's cat.[393] Thatcher actually died on April 8, 2013.\n* Orlando Thomas: A former professional football player who had Lou Gehrig's disease, Thomas was incorrectly reported as dead by the official website of the Minnesota Vikings, his former team, on October 28, 2009.[394] The story of Thomas's death was then picked up and re-reported by various news services, including the Associated Press.[395] He later died in 2014.\n* Donald Walter Trautman (Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania) was reported dead in the edition of April 4, 2007 of the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano; in fact it was his predecessor Bishop Michael Murphy who had just died. \"I told people that there was an early resurrection\", Trautman said. The Tablet printed a cartoon about the incident, depicting one angel at a reception desk telling another: \"Bishop Trautman's just e-mailed us with a cancellation.\"[396] Trautman died on February 26, 2022, at the age of 85.[397]\n* Mark Twain: American author, was falsely reported dead twice:\n    1. In 1897 when a journalist was sent to inquire after Twain's health, thinking he was near death; in fact it was his cousin who was very ill. Although (contrary to popular belief) no obituary was published, Twain recounted the event in the New York Journal of June 2, 1897, including his famous words \"The report of my death was an exaggeration\" (which is usually misquoted, e.g. as \"The rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated\", or \"Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated\").[398][399]\n    2. On May 4, 1907, when people lost track of a yacht he was traveling on, The New York Times published an article saying he might have been lost at sea.[400] In fact, the yacht had been held up by fog, and Twain had disembarked. Twain read the article, and cleared up the story by writing a humorous account in The New York Times the following day.[401]\nTwain died in 1910.\nU\n* Ishinosuke Uwano: in April 2006 this Japanese soldier, missing since World War II, was found to be living in Ukraine aged 83, where he had married and had a family. He had been officially declared dead in 2000. At the end of the war he had remained in the Soviet Union for unknown reasons; he said the Soviet government subsequently prevented him contacting his Japanese relatives. Following his discovery he visited Japan for the first time in over 60 years; he could remember little of Japan and had even largely forgotten how to speak Japanese.[402] Uwano died in 2013.[403]\nV\n\nErroneous reports of the death of Abe Vigoda became a running joke\n* Paul Vance, composer of the song \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\", was reported dead in September 2006 by Associated Press, followed by the rest of the media. The reports even caused racehorses owned by Vance to be scratched from races. In fact the dead man was a former salesman and painting contractor called Paul Van Valkenburgh, who had told his wife he had written the song many years earlier under the stage name Paul Vance. When pursued by an Associated Press reporter immediately after the scam was discovered, the impostor's widow, who had not yet been provided with evidence of her late husband's wrongdoing, said she was not certain whether it was Vance or her husband who had really written the song.[404] The real Paul Vance died on May 30, 2022.\n* Abe Vigoda (actor): in 1982, People magazine referred to him as 'the late Abe Vigoda'. He then posed for a photograph showing him sitting up in a coffin, holding the magazine in question. The same mistake was made in 1987 when a reporter for television station WWOR, Channel 9 in Secaucus, New Jersey, mistakenly referred to him as \"the late Abe Vigoda\".[405] She realized and corrected her mistake the next day.[405] Vigoda later claimed that during the 1980s, the widespread belief that he was dead cost him work.[406] Erroneous reports of Vigoda's death became something of a running joke, such as in television sketches, through the rest of Vigoda's life (further aided by Vigoda's longevity, as he would live to be 94 years old). The website \"Abe Vigoda Status\" featured nothing but a smiling photo of Vigoda, a live clock calibrated to the day and second, and the advisory \"Abe Vigoda is...\" followed by the up-to-the-minute information of \"alive\" until he actually died in 2016, whereupon the website went offline due to the number of requests, then eventually returned with the update that Vigoda was indeed dead.[407]\nW\n￼\n\nAmerican actress Betty White was the subject of a premature obituary on two occasions\n* Matthew Wall: On October 2, 1571, a pallbearer dropped his coffin on the way to the funeral, waking him up.

Wanless actually continued to serve in India until his retirement in 1928, and he died at home in California in 1933.[408]\n* Ian Watkins: In April 2014, a Russian news outlet reported that Watkins-the former singer of the Welsh band Lostprophets who had been sentenced to 35 years in prison for numerous sexual offenses-had committed suicide whilst in prison. The story resurfaced a month later and was confirmed to be a hoax by a Welsh news outlet.\n* Kate Webb: in 1971 the journalist was part of a group captured in the Cambodian jungle by North Vietnamese troops. Official reports claimed that a body that had been found and cremated was hers, and a box of bones said to be hers was delivered to Reuters. The New York Times published an obituary.[409] She emerged from captivity over three weeks later, having endured forced marches, interrogations, and two strains of malaria.[410] Webb died in 2007.\n* Harry Delyne Weed, the inventor of Weed non-skid tire chains, was reported dead in numerous publications (including Time magazine and the New York Herald Tribune) in 1927 after a reporter for the Jackson, Michigan Citizen Patriot wrote that the recently deceased Mrs. Alice Weed from Jackson had been the inventor's widow. It later emerged that Alice Weed was no relation, and that both the inventor and his wife were alive and well.[411]\n* Kanye West: was the subject of an Internet hoax news report on October 20, 2009, claiming that he had been killed in a car crash. The rumor quickly spread via social networking websites such as Twitter, prompting West's then-girlfriend Amber Rose to respond \"This 'RIP Kanye West' topic is not funny and it's NOT TRUE!\"[412]\n* Darene Springs Weston: In December 2015, this 43-year-old woman from Chester, South Carolina used forged documents in an attempt to declare herself dead so that she could avoid going to jail on drunk driving charges. After an investigation, she was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice.[413]\n* Alan Whicker (journalist), while reporting on the Korean War. He was flying with an aerial spotter in a Piper Aztec plane behind enemy lines, as part of a story. Although his plane landed safely, a similar craft was shot down on the same day, and was assumed to be Whicker's plane. The resulting newspaper obituary commented on his lack of achievement (Whicker then being far less well-known than he is now).[414] He died on July 12, 2013.\n* Betty White (actress and comedian): On September 3, 2014, a story from the Empire News Network (which typically publishes outright hoaxes) reported that White, at 92, \"dyed comfortably in her Los Angeles home\"; the article went on to describe White's longtime use of hair dye. The headline was deliberately written as a pun to appear as if it were an obituary, which confused many and led her agent to clarify that she is still alive. White, at the time, was filming episodes for the TV series Hot in Cleveland, on which she was a regular cast member.[415] She died on December 31, 2021, just 17 days before her 100th birthday.\n* Peter Whittingham: English footballer, most known for his decade at Cardiff City, was mistakenly reported dead by veteran journalist Terry Phillips on the \"Dai Sport\" website on March 17, 2020. Whittingham was in fact alive at the time, and hospitalised with head injuries after a fall.[416] He died two days later.[417]\n* Slim Whitman: the country singer was reported dead in January 2008 by a radio DJ and by the Nashville Tennessean's website, apparently sparked by rumours he had died. \"It seems like every 10 years something weird happens like that\", he said.[418] Whitman died in June 2013.\n* Paul Wight, better known by his professional wrestling ring name The Big Show, was reported killed by WWE on June 16, 2017, by satire news site The Onion stating that Wight was killed after a seven-year-old boy wandered into a steel cage during a live event in Indianapolis. The article, meant to lampoon the real-life killing of Harambe, a gorilla in a Cincinnati zoo, and clearly a satire and not a premature obituary, received criticism for The Onion satiring the murder of an actual person as well as many wrestling fans legitimately believing Wight was dead.[419][420]\n* Maurice Williams: After the husband of writer John Steinbeck's literary agent was reported to have died when his plane was shot down in flames over Germany during World War II, Steinbeck wrote an effusive obituary which was published in the New York Herald Tribune and widely syndicated. However, Williams had survived the crash, and had been rescued and spirited away by the French underground, which eventually returned him to his air corps unit in England.[421]\n* Philip Williams: in June 1982, this British soldier was knocked unconscious by an explosion during the Battle of Mount Tumbledown in the Falklands War, and left for dead. When he came to, the rest of the British soldiers had gone. Williams' parents were informed of his 'death' and a memorial service held for him. It took him nearly two months to find his way back to civilisation, braving extreme weather. He was then criticized by the media and fellow soldiers, who accused him of desertion.[422]\n* Rich Williams, guitarist in the band Kansas, whose obituary was published in a number of New England newspapers after the death of Eric de Boer of Kingston, New Hampshire. de Boer had been impersonating Williams for decades, claiming that after returning from Vietnam (where he had been held as a POW) he had joined Kansas, using the name \"Rich Williams\" as a stage name. The real Williams wrote in an e-mail sent to The Topeka Capital-Journal that he had known about the impersonation for five years and thought it was \"really wacky stuff\", but added that he respected de Boer for his service in Vietnam. It was later discovered that there was no evidence that de Boer had ever been in the military, let alone that he had been a Vietnam POW.[423][424][425]\n* Walter Williams: On February 26, 2014, this 78-year-old Mississippi man was declared dead by a hospice nurse. This was confirmed by the county coroner, and Williams' body was placed in a body bag and brought to a funeral home for embalming. However, funeral home workers noticed movement in the bag. They called for an ambulance, and paramedics confirmed that Williams had a pulse and was breathing. He was transported to a hospital where he began to recover, much to the delight of all involved.[426] Williams actually died of natural causes just over two weeks later, on March 13.[427]\n* Ken Williamson, an Olympic track-and-field judge, collapsed outside Madison Square Garden in 2004 from a heart attack, and was said by officials and a colleague to have died. However, he was revived with a defibrillator and taken to hospital.[428]\n* Edward Osborne Wilson (biologist and environmentalist), was listed as dead in a 2005 San Francisco Chronicle article.[304] He died on December 26, 2021.\n* Mara Wilson (actress) was listed as dead on the Internet Movie Database in 2000, with the cause being \"broken neck\".[429]\n* Owen Wilson was reported to have died in a snowboarding accident.[430]\n* Robert Anton Wilson was reported dead in February 1994 in a hoax story that purported to be an obituary published in the Los Angeles Times, circulated on the Internet by a prankster in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[431] Wilson then wrote an essay titled \"I Got Run Over on the Information Superhighway\", which was published in his next book Cosmic Trigger III: My Life After Death. In reality Wilson continued living until 2007.\n* Jesse Winchester: the songwriter was prematurely reported dead by several sources on April 7, 2014. He was in fact gravely ill, and died on April 11.[432]\n* Bennie Wint: this American thought the police were after him and wanted to arrest him on drug charges, and faked his death while on a honeymoon in Daytona Beach, Florida in September 1989. Wint was missing and presumed dead for 20 years, leaving his fiancée and four-year-old son behind. Twenty years later, he was pulled over for not having a light bulb in his licence plate, and subsequently confessed. While he was living under a false identity, he had had another child.[433]\n* Norman Wisdom: the British comedian was reported dead by Sky News on December 28, 2008, with a pre-prepared video obituary having been accidentally published. Wisdom died on October 4, 2010.[434]\n* Heinz Wolff: the German-British scientist and television personality was reported dead by The Sun, resulting in obituaries in The Times and The Independent. They had mistaken him for his namesake the psychiatrist Dr. Heinz Wolff.[435]\n* John Wooden: an online picture gallery of the legendary basketball coach on The Washington Post's website on June 3, 2010, was headlined \"John Wooden dies at 99\". Wooden was at the time hospitalized in grave condition,[436] and he died the next day.\n\nY\n* Paltan Yadav was officially declared dead in 1980 by relatives in order to steal his land in Uttar Pradesh, India. Rendered penniless and unable to afford to marry, he became a holy man. After years of legal delays, his 'death' was only annulled in 1999 after intervention by the Association of the Dead, an organisation that protests such cases. (See also Lal Bihari.)[30][99]\n* Yuko Yamaguchi, the current character designer for Hello Kitty, was rumored on social media to have died in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. She was subsequently confirmed to be alive by Sanrio and Yamaguchi herself.[437]\n* Shoichi Yokoi: trapped on Guam when U.S. troops recaptured it near the end of World War II, this Japanese soldier lived in a cave in the jungle until 1972, believing that the war had not ended and that leaflets reporting Japan's surrender were enemy propaganda. He had been reported killed in action. On his return home, Yokoi was treated as a national hero for his extreme tenacity and loyalty. However, he felt he had not served the Emperor and army adequately, saying \"It is with much embarrassment that I have returned alive\"—which instantly became a popular saying in Japan. Yokoi's experiences enabled him to become a television commentator on survival skills. His discovery also prompted a search for other missing Japanese soldiers such as Hiroo Onoda.[438] He died in 1997.\n* Carl Gabriel Yorke: see Luca Barbareschi.\n\n* Mae Young, a professional wrestler, was incorrectly reported dead by TMZ and pro-wrestling news websites on January 9, 2014. She was in fact gravely ill, and she died on January 14, 2014.\n* Neil Young, musician, has been the subject of several false death reports:\n    * In February 1979, Young's manager Elliot Roberts stated he had twice had to deal with reports of Young's death. \"One time his father called me. Said that he'd read in the AP that Neil died and was it true. Another time Warner Brothers called me and said was there any truth to Neil's demise in Paris. Both times they were 'drug accidents.' \"Right,\" says Young. \"I was traveling on the highway and was hit by a huge drug truck.\"[439]\n    * In the 1975 comedy LP Goodbye Pop 1952–1976 issued by The National Lampoon, there is a fake obituary for Neil Young in the track \"A History of Neil Young\", which is, in turn, part of a set of short fake documentary segments, \"The History of Rock And Roll.\" \"Poor Neil, dead as a doorknob\", the presenter laments, while speculating, \"Could it have been a drug overdose?\" In closing, the presenter notes that Young's death \"...is a great loss to both rock and roll.\"\n    * Upon the death of Neil Armstrong in 2012, NBC News confused the name of the astronaut with Young in the article about his death. The mix-up went unnoticed in the rush to be first to get the news out about Armstrong's death, and was consequently fixed.\n* Alberto Youssef: a convicted money-launderer was falsely reported dead by a hoax that circulated in the social network in the day of the Brazilian presidential elections. The report accused the ruling Worker's Party of assassinating Youssef to protect the reelection of Dilma Rousseff because of Youssef's plea bargain in the Car-Wash Operation.[440][441]\nZ\n* Lotfi A. Zadeh, an Iranian-Azerbaijani mathematician and computer scientist, was incorrectly reported to have died in August 2017. His alma mater, the University of Tehran, wrote an obituary while he was in ill health at the age of 95, and withdrew it. He died a month later.[citation needed]\n* Louis Zamperini: Zamperini and his colleagues were declared dead in absentia in 1944, a year after their airplane crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Zamperini and two others survived the crash and found their way to the Marshall Islands only to be taken prisoner by Japanese war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Only after the islands were liberated was Zamperini discovered to be alive. Zamperini lived until 2014.[442]\n* Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a Russian politician, was reported to have died from COVID-19 complications on March 25, 2022, by Senator Alexander Pronyushkin.[443][444] Russian military officials and Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin denied reports of his death.[443][445] Zhirinovsky died less than two weeks later, on April 6, 2022.[446]\n",

      "text": "Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine. Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, particularly science fiction. The idea of a time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel The Time Machine.\nIt is uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible, and such travel, if at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find solutions in general relativity that allow for it, such as a rotating black hole. Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in theoretical physics, and is usually connected only with quantum mechanics or wormholes. \nHistory of the time travel concept\nStatue of Rip Van Winkle in Irvington, New York\nSome ancient myths depict a character skipping forward in time. In Hindu mythology, the Vishnu Purana mentions the story of King Raivata Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is surprised to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed. The Buddhist Pāli Canon mentions the relativity of time. The Payasi Sutta tells of one of the Buddha's chief disciples, Kumara Kassapa, who explains to the skeptic Payasi that time in the Heavens passes differently than on Earth. The Japanese tale of \"Urashima Tarō\", first described in the Manyoshu tells of a young fisherman named Urashima-no-ko (浦嶋子) who visits an undersea palace. After three days, he returns home to his village and finds himself 300 years in the future, where he has been forgotten, his house is in ruins, and his family has died. In Jewish tradition, the 1st-century BC scholar Honi ha-M'agel is said to have fallen asleep and slept for seventy years. When waking up he returned home but found none of the people he knew, and no one believed his claims of who he was.\nShift to science fiction\nEarly science fiction stories feature characters who sleep for years and awaken in a changed society, or are transported to the past through supernatural means. Among them L'An 2440, rêve s'il en fût jamais (The Year 2440: A Dream If Ever There Was One, 1770) by Louis-Sébastien Mercier, Rip Van Winkle (1819) by Washington Irving, Looking Backward (1888) by Edward Bellamy, and When the Sleeper Awakes (1899) by H.G. Wells. Prolonged sleep, like the later more familiar time machine, is used as a means of time travel in these stories.\nThe earliest work about backwards time travel is uncertain. The Chinese novel Supplement to the Journey to the West (c. 1640) by Dong Yue features magical mirrors and jade gateways that connect various points in time. The protagonist Sun Wukong travels back in time to the \"World of the Ancients\" (Qin Dynasty) to retrieve a magical bell and then travels forward to the \"World of the Future\" (Song Dynasty) to find an emperor who has been exiled in time. However, the time travel takes place inside an illusory dream world created by the villain to entrap and distract him. Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733) is a series of letters from British ambassadors in 1997 and 1998 to diplomats in the past, conveying the political and religious conditions of the future.: 95–96  Because the narrator receives these letters from his guardian angel, Paul Alkon suggests in his book Origins of Futuristic Fiction that \"the first time-traveler in English literature is a guardian angel\".: 85  Madden does not explain how the angel obtains these documents, but Alkon asserts that Madden \"deserves recognition as the first to toy with the rich idea of time-travel in the form of an artifact sent backward from the future to be discovered in the present\".: 95–96  In the science fiction anthology Far Boundaries (1951), editor August Derleth claims that an early short story about time travel is An Anachronism; or, Missing One's Coach, written for the Dublin Literary Magazine by an anonymous author in the June 1838 issue.: 3  While the narrator waits under a tree for a coach to take him out of Newcastle upon Tyne, he is transported back in time over a thousand years. He encounters the Venerable Bede in a monastery and explains to him the developments of the coming centuries. However, the story never makes it clear whether these events are real or a dream.: 11–38  Another early work about time travel is The Forebears of Kalimeros: Alexander, son of Philip of Macedon by Alexander Veltman published in 1836.\nMr. and Mrs. Fezziwig dance in a vision shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Past.\nCharles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843) has early depictions of mystical time travel in both directions, as the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, is transported to Christmases past and future. Other stories employ the same template, where a character naturally goes to sleep, and upon waking up finds themself in a different time. A clearer example of backward time travel is found in the popular 1861 book Paris avant les hommes (Paris before Men) by the French botanist and geologist Pierre Boitard, published posthumously. In this story, the protagonist is transported to the prehistoric past by the magic of a \"lame demon\" (a French pun on Boitard's name), where he encounters a Plesiosaur and an apelike ancestor and is able to interact with ancient creatures. Edward Everett Hale's \"Hands Off\" (1881) tells the story of an unnamed being, possibly the soul of a person who has recently died, who interferes with ancient Egyptian history by preventing Joseph's enslavement. This may have been the first story to feature an alternate history created as a result of time travel.: 54 \nEarly time machines\nOne of the first stories to feature time travel by means of a machine is \"The Clock that Went Backward\" by Edward Page Mitchell, which appeared in the New York Sun in 1881. However, the mechanism borders on fantasy. An unusual clock, when wound, runs backwards and transports people nearby back in time. The author does not explain the origin or properties of the clock.: 55  Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's El Anacronópete (1887) may have been the first story to feature a vessel engineered to travel through time. Andrew Sawyer has commented that the story \"does seem to be the first literary description of a time machine noted so far\", adding that \"Edward Page Mitchell's story The Clock That Went Backward (1881) is usually described as the first time-machine story, but I'm not sure that a clock quite counts\". H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1895) popularized the concept of time travel by mechanical means.\nTime travel in physics\nSome theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime or specific types of motion in space might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible.: 499  In technical papers, physicists discuss the possibility of closed timelike curves, which are world lines that form closed loops in spacetime, allowing objects to return to their own past. There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as Gödel spacetime, but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.\nMany in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely. Any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of causality. The classic example of a problem involving causality is the \"grandfather paradox,\" which involves travelling to the past and intervening in the conception of one's ancestors (causing the death of an ancestor before said conception being frequently cited.) Some physicists, such as Novikov and Deutsch, suggested that these sorts of temporal paradoxes can be avoided through the Novikov self-consistency principle or a variation of the many-worlds interpretation with interacting worlds.\nGeneral relativity\nTime travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the speed of light, such as cosmic strings, traversable wormholes, and Alcubierre drives.: 33–130  The theory of general relativity does suggest a scientific basis for the possibility of backward time travel in certain unusual scenarios, although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity, these loopholes may be closed. These semiclassical arguments led Stephen Hawking to formulate the chronology protection conjecture, suggesting that the fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel, but physicists cannot come to a definite judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory.: 150 \nDifferent spacetime geometries\nThe theory of general relativity describes the universe under a system of field equations that determine the metric, or distance function, of spacetime. There exist exact solutions to these equations that include closed time-like curves, which are world lines that intersect themselves; some point in the causal future of the world line is also in its causal past, a situation that can be described as time travel. Such a solution was first proposed by Kurt Gödel, a solution known as the Gödel metric, but his (and others') solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have,: 499  such as rotation and lack of Hubble expansion. Whether general relativity forbids closed time-like curves for all realistic conditions is still being researched.\nWormholes\nMain article: Wormhole\nWormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime permitted by the Einstein field equations of general relativity.: 100  A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced propulsion system, and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, time dilation causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently through the wormhole than outside it, so that synchronized clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.: 502  This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;: 503  in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.\nAccording to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as \"exotic matter\". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various energy conditions, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,: 101  and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the Casimir effect in quantum physics. Although early calculations suggested that a very large amount of negative energy would be required, later calculations showed that the amount of negative energy can be made arbitrarily small.\nIn 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other. Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for causality violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex \"Roman ring\" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.\nOther approaches based on general relativity\nAnother approach involves a dense spinning cylinder usually referred to as a Tipler cylinder, a GR solution discovered by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves: 21  until an analysis by Frank Tipler in 1974. If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis, then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time (or forward, depending on the direction of its spiral). However, the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it. A similar device might be built from a cosmic string, but none are known to exist, and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string. Physicist Ronald Mallett is attempting to recreate the conditions of a rotating black hole with ring lasers, in order to bend spacetime and allow for time travel.\nA more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a \"time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon\") in a region where the weak energy condition is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density (exotic matter). Solutions such as Tipler's assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough,: 169  he did not prove this. But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, \"it can't be done with positive energy density everywhere! I can prove that to build a finite time machine, you need negative energy.\": 96  This result comes from Hawking's 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture, where he examines \"the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities\" and proves that \"there will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon.\" This theorem does not rule out the possibility of time travel by means of time machines with the non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons (such as the Deutsch-Politzer time machine) or in regions which contain exotic matter, which would be used for traversable wormholes or the Alcubierre drive and black hole.\nQuantum physics\nMain article: Quantum mechanics of time travel\nNo-communication theorem\nWhen a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. When the signal travels faster than light, it is received before it is sent, in all reference frames. The signal could be said to have moved backward in time. This hypothetical scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.\nQuantum-mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation, the EPR paradox, or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles. This effect was referred to as \"spooky action at a distance\" by Einstein.\nNevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories, and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication. In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used. The no-communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.\nInteracting many-worlds interpretation\nA variation of Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not \"genuine\" time travel. The accepted many-worlds interpretation suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories. However, some variations allow different universes to interact. This concept is most often used in science-fiction, but some physicists such as David Deutsch have suggested that a time traveler should end up in a different history than the one he started from. On the other hand, Stephen Hawking has argued that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history, so that time travelers remain within their own world rather than traveling to a different one. The physicist Allen Everett argued that Deutsch's approach \"involves modifying fundamental principles of quantum mechanics; it certainly goes beyond simply adopting the MWI\". Everett also argues that even if Deutsch's approach is correct, it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time through a wormhole, with different particles emerging in different worlds.\nExperimental results\nCertain experiments carried out give the impression of reversed causality, but fail to show it under closer examination.\nThe delayed choice quantum eraser experiment performed by Marlan Scully involves pairs of entangled photons that are divided into \"signal photons\" and \"idler photons\", with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the double-slit experiment. Depending on how the idler photon is measured, the experimenter can either learn which of the two locations the signal photon emerged from or \"erase\" that information. Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons, the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an interference pattern is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons. However, since interference can be observed only after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons, there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons, only by gathering classical information from the entire system; thus causality is preserved.\nThe experiment of Lijun Wang might also show causality violation since it made it possible to send packages of waves through a bulb of caesium gas in such a way that the package appeared to exit the bulb 62 nanoseconds before its entry, but a wave package is not a single well-defined object but rather a sum of multiple waves of different frequencies (see Fourier analysis), and the package can appear to move faster than light or even backward in time even if none of the pure waves in the sum do so. This effect cannot be used to send any matter, energy, or information faster than light, so this experiment is understood not to violate causality either.\nThe physicists Günter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the University of Koblenz, claim to have violated Einstein's theory of relativity by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light. They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons traveled \"instantaneously\" between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to 3 ft (0.91 m) apart, using a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. Nimtz told New Scientist magazine: \"For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of.\" However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the University of Toronto, Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars at each station along the way, so that the center of the train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.\nShengwang Du claims in a peer-reviewed journal to have observed single photons' precursors, saying that they travel no faster than c in a vacuum. His experiment involved slow light as well as passing light through a vacuum. He generated two single photons, passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser (thus slowing the light) and passing one through a vacuum. Both times, apparently, the precursors preceded the photons' main bodies, and the precursor traveled at c in a vacuum. According to Du, this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than c and, thus, no possibility of violating causality.\nAbsence of time travelers from the future\nMany have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers. Some versions of general relativity suggest that time travel might only be possible in a region of spacetime that is warped a certain way, and hence time travelers would not be able to travel back to earlier regions in spacetime, before this region existed. Stephen Hawking stated that this would explain why the world has not already been overrun by \"tourists from the future\".\nAdvertisement placed in a 1980 edition of Artforum, advertising the Krononauts event\nSeveral experiments have been carried out to try to entice future humans, who might invent time travel technology, to come back and demonstrate it to people of the present time. Events such as Perth's Destination Day or MIT's Time Traveler Convention heavily publicized permanent \"advertisements\" of a meeting time and place for future time travelers to meet. In 1982, a group in Baltimore, Maryland, identifying itself as the Krononauts, hosted an event of this type welcoming visitors from the future. These experiments only stood the possibility of generating a positive result demonstrating the existence of time travel, but have failed so far—no time travelers are known to have attended either event. Some versions of the many-worlds interpretation can be used to suggest that future humans have traveled back in time, but have traveled back to the meeting time and place in a parallel universe.\nTime dilation\nMain article: Time dilation\nTransversal time dilation. The blue dots represent a pulse of light. Each pair of dots with light \"bouncing\" between them is a clock. For each group of clocks, the other group appears to be ticking more slowly, because the moving clock's light pulse has to travel a larger distance than the stationary clock's light pulse. That is so, even though the clocks are identical and their relative motion is perfectly reciprocal.\nThere is a great deal of observable evidence for time dilation in special relativity and gravitational time dilation in general relativity, for example in the famous and easy-to-replicate observation of atmospheric muon decay. The theory of relativity states that the speed of light is invariant for all observers in any frame of reference; that is, it is always the same. Time dilation is a direct consequence of the invariance of the speed of light. Time dilation may be regarded in a limited sense as \"time travel into the future\": a person may use time dilation so that a small amount of proper time passes for them, while a large amount of proper time passes elsewhere. This can be achieved by traveling at relativistic speeds or through the effects of gravity.\nFor two identical clocks moving relative to each other without accelerating, each clock measures the other to be ticking slower. This is possible due to the relativity of simultaneity. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The twin paradox describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to relativistic speed as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as equivalent, and shows that time dilation also occurs in gravity wells, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the Global Positioning System, and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a black hole.: 33–130 \nA time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the mass of Jupiter. A person at its center will travel forward in time at a rate four times slower than that of distant observers. Squeezing the mass of a large planet into such a small structure is not expected to be within humanity's technological capabilities in the near future.: 76–140  With current technologies, it is only possible to cause a human traveler to age less than companions on Earth by a few milliseconds after a few hundred days of space travel.\nPhilosophy\nMain article: Philosophy of space and time\nPhilosophers have discussed the nature of time since at least the time of ancient Greece; for example, Parmenides presented the view that time is an illusion. Centuries later, Isaac Newton supported the idea of absolute time, while his contemporary Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz maintained that time is only a relation between events and it cannot be expressed independently. The latter approach eventually gave rise to the spacetime of relativity.\nPresentism vs. eternalism\nMany philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism, the idea that the past and future exist in a real sense, not only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present. Philosopher of science Dean Rickles disagrees with some qualifications, but notes that \"the consensus among philosophers seems to be that special and general relativity are incompatible with presentism\". Some philosophers view time as a dimension equal to spatial dimensions, that future events are \"already there\" in the same sense different places exist, and that there is no objective flow of time; however, this view is disputed.\nThe bar and ring paradox is an example of the relativity of simultaneity. Both ends of the bar pass through the ring simultaneously in the rest frame of the ring (left), but the ends of the bar pass one after the other in the rest frame of the bar (right).\nPresentism is a school of philosophy that holds that the future and the past exist only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present, and they have no real existence of their own. In this view, time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to. Keller and Nelson have argued that even if past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler's actual appearance in the present; these views are contested by some authors.\nPresentism in classical spacetime deems that only the present exists; this is not reconcilable with special relativity, shown in the following example: Alice and Bob are simultaneous observers of event O. For Alice, some event E is simultaneous with O, but for Bob, event E is in the past or future. Therefore, Alice and Bob disagree about what exists in the present, which contradicts classical presentism. \"Here-now presentism\" attempts to reconcile this by only acknowledging the time and space of a single point; this is unsatisfactory because objects coming and going from the \"here-now\" alternate between real and unreal, in addition to the lack of a privileged \"here-now\" that would be the \"real\" present. \"Relativized presentism\" acknowledges that there are infinite frames of reference, each of them having a different set of simultaneous events, which makes it impossible to distinguish a single \"real\" present, and hence either all events in time are real—blurring the difference between presentism and eternalism—or each frame of reference exists in its own reality. Options for presentism in special relativity appear to be exhausted, but Gödel and others suspect presentism may be valid for some forms of general relativity. Generally, the idea of absolute time and space is considered incompatible with general relativity; there is no universal truth about the absolute position of events which occur at different times, and thus no way to determine which point in space at one time is at the universal \"same position\" at another time, and all coordinate systems are on equal footing as given by the principle of diffeomorphism invariance.\nThe grandfather paradox\nMain article: Grandfather paradox\nA common objection to the idea of traveling back in time is put forth in the grandfather paradox or the argument of auto-infanticide. If one were able to go back in time, inconsistencies and contradictions would ensue if the time traveler were to change anything; there is a contradiction if the past becomes different from the way it is. The paradox is commonly described with a person who travels to the past and kills their own grandfather, prevents the existence of their father or mother, and therefore their own existence. Philosophers question whether these paradoxes prove time travel impossible. Some philosophers answer the paradoxes by arguing that it might be the case that backward time travel could be possible but that it would be impossible to actually change the past in any way, an idea similar to the proposed Novikov self-consistency principle in physics.\nOntological paradox\nCompossibility\nAccording to the philosophical theory of compossibility, what can happen, for example in the context of time travel, must be weighed against the context of everything relating to the situation. If the past is a certain way, it's not possible for it to be any other way. What can happen when a time traveler visits the past is limited to what did happen, in order to prevent logical contradictions.\nSelf-consistency principle\nThe Novikov self-consistency principle, named after Igor Dmitrievich Novikov, states that any actions taken by a time traveler or by an object that travels back in time were part of history all along, and therefore it is impossible for the time traveler to \"change\" history in any way. The time traveler's actions may be the cause of events in their own past though, which leads to the potential for circular causation, sometimes called a predestination paradox, ontological paradox, or bootstrap paradox. The term bootstrap paradox was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein's story \"By His Bootstraps\". The Novikov self-consistency principle proposes that the local laws of physics in a region of spacetime containing time travelers cannot be any different from the local laws of physics in any other region of spacetime.\nThe philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in \"Time Travel Paradoxes\" that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Ross uses the film Somewhere in Time as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that entropy of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law, so decreasing entropy and non-increasing entropy are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.: 23 \nIn 2005, Daniel Greenberger and Karl Svozil proposed that quantum theory gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.\nIn fiction\nFurther information: Time travel in fiction\nTime travel themes in science fiction and the media can be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation. The non-scientific term timeline is often used to refer to all physical events in history, so that where events are changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new timeline. \n",

      "text": "time-traTime travel is commonly defined with David Lewis’ definition: An object time travels if and only if the difference between its departure and arrival times as measured in the surrounding world does not equal the duration of the journey undergone by the object. For example, Jane is a time traveler if she travels away from home in her spaceship for one hour as measured by her own clock on the ship but travels two hours as measured by the clock back home, assuming both clocks are functioning properly.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, scientists and philosophers rarely investigated time travel, but now it is an exciting and deeply studied topic. There are investigations into travel to the future and travel to the past, although travel to the past is more problematical and receives more attention.   There are also investigations of the logical possibility of time travel, the physical possibility of time travel, and the technological practicality of time travel. The most attention is paid to time travel that is consistent with current physical theory such as Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In science, different models of the cosmos and the laws of nature governing the universe imply different possibilities for time travel. So, theories about time travel have changed radically as the dominant cosmological theories have evolved from classical, Newtonian conceptions to modern, relativistic and quantum mechanical conceptions. Philosophers were quick to note some of the implications of the new physics for venerable issues in metaphysics: the nature of time, causation and personal identity, to name just a few. The subject continues to produce a fruitful cross-fertilization of ideas between scientists and philosophers as theorists in both fields struggle to resolve confounding paradoxes that emerge when time travel is pondered seriously. This article discusses both the scientific and philosophical issues relevant to time travel.\nTable of Contents\n\n    Introduction\n    Definition\n    Time in Philosophy\n    Time in Physics\n        Newtonian Cosmology\n        Special Relativity\n        General Relativity\n        Quantum Interpretations\n    Causation\n        The Grandfather Paradox\n        Causal Loops\n    Personal Identity\n    References and Further Reading\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTime travel stories have been a staple of the science fiction genre for the past century. Good science fiction stories often pay homage to the fundamentals of scientific knowledge of the time. Thus, we see time travel stories of the variety typified by H. G. Wells as set within the context of a Newtonian universe: a three-dimensional Euclidean spatial manifold that changes along an inexorable arrow of time. By the early to mid-twentieth century, time travel stories evolved to take into account the features of an Einsteinian universe: a four-dimensional spacetime continuum that curves and in which time has the character of a spatial dimension (that is, there can be local variations or “warps”). More recently, time travel stories have incorporated features of quantum theory: phenomena such as superposition and entanglement suggest the possibility of parallel or many universes, many minds, or many histories. Indeed, the sometimes counter-intuitive principles and effects of quantum theory have invigorated time travel stories. Bizarre phenomena like negative energy density (the Casimir effect) lend their strangeness to the already odd character of time travel stories.\n\nIn this article, we make a distinction between time travel stories that might be possible within the canon of known physical laws and those stories that contravene or go beyond known laws. The former type of stories, which we shall call natural time travel, exploit the features or natural topology of spacetime regions. Natural time travel tends to severely constrain the activities of a time traveler and entails immense technological challenges. The latter type of stories, which we shall call Wellsian time travel, enable the time traveler more freedom and simplify the technological challenges, but at the expense of the physics. For example, in H. G. Wells’ story, the narrator is a time traveler who constructs a machine that transports him through time. The time traveler’s journey, as he experiences it, occurs over some nonzero duration of time. Also, the journey is through some different nonzero duration of time in the world. It is the latter condition that distinguishes the natural time travel story from the Wellsian time travel story. Our laws of physics do not allow travel through a nonzero duration of time in the world (in a sense that will be made clearer below). Wellsian time travel stories are mortgaged on our hope or presumption that more fundamental laws of nature are yet to be discovered beyond the current horizon of scientific knowledge. Natural time travel stories can be analyzed for consistency with known physics while Wellsian time travel stories can be analyzed for consistency with logic. Finally, time travel stories implicate themselves in a constellation of common philosophical problems. Among these philosophically related issues we will address in this article are the metaphysics of time, causality, and personal identity.\n2. Definition\n\nWhat is time travel? One standard definition is that of David Lewis’s: an object time travels iff the difference between its departure and arrival times in the surrounding world does not equal the duration of the journey undergone by the object. This definition applies to both natural and Wellsian time travel. For example, Jane might be a time traveler if she travels for one hour but arrives two hours later in the future (or two hours earlier in the past). In both types of time travel, the times experienced by a time traveler are different from the time undergone by their surrounding world.\n\nBut what do we mean by the “time” in time travel? And what do we mean by “travel” in time travel? As the definition for time travel presently stands, we need to clarify what we mean by the word “time” (see the next section). While philosophical analysis of time travel has attended mostly to the difficult issue of time, might there also be vagueness in the word “travel”? Our use of the word “travel” implies two places: an origin and a destination. “I’m going to Morocco,” means “I’m departing from my origination point here and I plan to arrive eventually in Morocco.” But when we are speaking of time travel, where exactly does a time traveler go? The time of origin is plain enough: the time of the time traveler and the time traveler’s surrounding world coincide at the beginning of the journey. But “where” does the time traveler arrive? Are we equivocating in our use of the word ‘travel’ by simply substituting a when for a where? In truth, how do we conceive of a “when”—as a place, a locale, or a region? Different scientific ontologies result in different ideas of what travel through time might be like. Also, different metaphysical concepts of time result in different ideas of what kinds of time travel are possible. It is to the issue of time in philosophy that we now turn.\n3. Time in Philosophy\n\nHow is time related to existence? Philosophy offers three primary answers to this metaphysical question: eternalism, possibilism, and presentism. The names of these views indicate the ontological status given to time. The eternalist thinks that time, correctly understood, is a fourth dimension essentially constitutive of reality together with space. All times, past, present and future, are actual times just like all points distributed in space are actual points in space. One cannot privilege any one moment in the dimension of time as “more” real than any other moment just like one cannot privilege any point in space as “more” real than any other point. The universe is thus a spacetime “block,” a view that has philosophical roots at least as far back as Parmenides. Everything is one; the appearance of things coming to be and ceasing to be, of time passing or flowing, is simply phenomenal, not real. Objects from the past and future have equal ontological status with present objects. Thus, a presently extinct individual dodo bird exists as equably as a presently existing individual house finch, and the dodo bird and the house finch exist as equably as an individual baby sparrow hatched next Saturday. Whether or not the dodo bird and the baby sparrow are present is irrelevant ontologically; they simply aren’t in our spacetime region right now. The physicist typically views the relation of time to existence in the way that the eternalist does. The life of an object in the universe can be properly shown as:\n\ntimetravel1\n\nThis diagram shows the spatial movement (in one dimension) of an object through time. The standard depiction of an object’s spacetime “worldline” in Special Relativity, the Minkowski diagram (see below), privileges this block view of the universe. Many Wellsian time travel stories assume the standpoint of eternalism. For example, in Wells’ The Time Machine, the narrator (the time traveler) explains: “There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.” Eternalism fits easily into the metaphysics of time travel.\n\nThe second view is possibilism, also known as the “growing block” or “growing universe” view. The possibilist thinks that the eternalist’s picture of the universe is correct except for the status of the future. The past and the present are fixed and actual; the future is only possible. Or more precisely, the future of an object holds the possibility of many different worldlines, only one of which will become actual for the object. If eternalism seems overly deterministic, eliminating indeterminacies and human free choice, then possibilism seems to retain some indeterminacy and free choice, at least as far as the future is concerned. For the possibilist, the present takes on a special significance that it does not have for the eternalist. The life of an object according to possibilism might be shown as:\n\ntimetravel2\n\nThis diagram shows that the object’s worldline is not yet fixed or complete. (It should be pointed out that the necessity of illustrating the time axis with a beginning and end should not be construed as an implicit claim that time itself has a beginning and end.) Some Wellsian time travel stories make use of possibilism. Stories like Back to the Future and Terminator suggest that we can change the outcome of historical events in our world, including our own personal future, through time travel. The many different possible histories of an object introduce other philosophical problems of causation and personal identity, issues that we will consider in greater depth in later sections of the article.\n\nThe third view is presentism. The presentist thinks that only temporally present objects are real. Whatever is, exists now. The past was, but exists no longer; the future will be, but does not exist yet. Objects are scattered throughout space but they are not scattered throughout time. Presentists do not think that time is a dimension in the same sense as the three spatial dimensions; they say the block universe view of the eternalists (and the intermediate view of the possibilists) gets the metaphysics of time wrong. If eternalism has its philosophical roots in Parmenides, then presentism can be understood as having its philosophical roots in Heraclitus. Presently existing things are the only actuality and only what is now is real. Each “now” is unique: “You cannot step twice into the same river; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.” The life of an object according to presentism might be shown as:\n\ntimetravel3\n\nMany presentists account for the continuity of time, the timelike connection of one moment to the next moment, by appealing to the present intrinsic properties of the world (Bigelow). To fully describe some of these present intrinsic properties of the world, you need past- and future-tensed truths to supervene on those properties. For example, in ordinary language we might make the claim that “George Washington camped at Valley Forge.” This sentence has an implicit claim to a timeless truth, that is, it was true 500 years ago, it was true when it was happening, it is true now, and it will be true next month. But, according to presentism, only presently existing things are real. Thus, the proper way to understand the truth of this sentence is to translate it into a more primitive form, where the tense is captured by an operator. So in our example, the truth of the sentence supervenes on the present according to the formulation “WAS(George Washington camps at Valley Forge).” In this way, presentists can describe events in the past and future as truths that supervene on the present. It is the basis for their account of persistence through time in issues like causality and personal identity.\n4. Time in Physics\n\nSince the use of the term ‘time’ in our definition of time travel remains ambiguous, we may further distinguish external, or physical time from personal, or inner time (again, following Lewis). In the ordinary world, external time and one’s personal time coincide with one another. In the world of the time traveler, they do not. So, with these two senses of time, we may further clarify time travel to occur when the duration of the journey according to the personal time of the time traveler does not equal the duration of the journey in external time. Most (but not all) philosophy of time concerns external time (see the encyclopedia entry Time). For the purpose of natural time travel, we need to examine the scientific understanding of external time and how it has changed.\na. Newtonian Cosmology\n\nNewton argued that space, time and motion were absolute, that is, that the entire universe was a single, uniform inertial frame and that time passed equably throughout it according to an eternally fixed, immutable and inexorable rate, without relation to anything external. Natural time travel in the Newtonian universe is impossible; there are no attributes or topography of space or time that can be exploited for natural time travel stories. Only time travel stories that exceed the bounds of Newtonian physics are possible and scenarios described by some Wellsian time travel stories (most notably like the one Wells himself wrote) are examples of such unscientific time travel.\n\nSeveral philosophers and scientists objected to the notion of absolute space, time and motion, most notably Leibniz, Berkeley and Mach. Mach rejected Newton’s implication that there was anything substantive about time: “It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the changes of things” (The Science of Mechanics, 1883). For Mach, change was more fundamental than the concept of time. We talk about time “passing” but what we’re really noticing is that things move and change around us. We find it convenient to talk as if there were some underlying flowing substance like the water of a river that carries these changes along with it. We abstract time to have a standard measuring tool by which we can quantify change. These views of Mach’s were influential for the young Albert Einstein. In 1905, Einstein published his famous paper on Special Relativity. This theory began the transformation of our understanding of space, time and motion.\nb. Special Relativity\n\nThe theory of Special Relativity has two defining principles: the principle of relativity and the invariance of the speed of light. Briefly, the principle of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same for any inertial observer. An observer is an inertial observer if the observer’s trajectory has a constant velocity and therefore is not under the influence of any force. The second principle is the invariance of the speed of light. All inertial observers measure the speed c of light in a vacuum as 3 x 108 m/s, regardless of their velocities relative to one another. This principle was implied in Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism (1873) and the constancy of c was verified by the Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment (1887).\n\nThis second principle profoundly affected the model of the cosmos: the constancy of c was inconsistent with Newtonian physics. The invariance of the speed of light according to Special Relativity replaces the invariance of time and distance in the Newtonian universe. Intervals of space, like length, and intervals of time (and hence, motion) are no longer absolute quantities. Instead of speaking of an object in a particular position independently of a particular time, we now speak of an event in which position and time are inseparable. We can relate two events with a new quantity, the spacetime interval. For any pair of events, the spacetime interval is an absolute quantity (that is, has the same value) for all inertial observers. To visualize this new quantity, one constructs spacetime diagrams (Minkowski diagrams) in which an event is defined by its spatial position (usually restricted to one dimension, x) and its time (ct). Thus, a spacetime interval might be null (parallel to the trajectory of light, which, because of the y-axis units, is shown at a 45° angle), spacelike (little or no variation in time), or timelike (little or no variation in spatial position). The following figure shows a Minkowski diagram depicting the flat spacetime of Special Relativity and three different spacetime intervals, or worldlines.\n\ntimetravel4\n\nWhat are the consequences of Special Relativity for time travel? First, we lose the common sense meaning of simultaneity. For example, the same event happens at two different times if one observer’s inertial frame is stationary relative to another observer’s inertial frame moving at some velocity. Furthermore, an observer in the stationary inertial frame may determine two events to have happened simultaneously, but an observer in the second moving inertial frame would see the same two events happening at different times. Thus, there is no universal or absolute external time; we can only speak of external time within one’s own frame of reference. The lack of simultaneity across frames of reference means that we might experience the phenomenon of time dilation. If your frame of reference is moving at some fraction of the speed of light, your external time passes more slowly than the external time in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to yours. If we imagine that someone in the stationary frame of reference could peek at a clock in your frame of reference, they would see your clock run very slowly. So in Special Relativity, we can find a kind of natural time travel. An example of Special Relativity time travel is of an astronaut who travels some distance in the universe at a velocity near the speed of light. The astronaut’s personal time elapses at the same rate it always has. He travels to his destination and then returns home to find that external time has passed there quite differently. Everyone he knew has aged more than he, or perhaps has even been dead for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\nSuch stories are physically consistent with the Einsteinian universe of Special Relativity, but of course they remain technologically beyond our present capability. Nevertheless, they are an example of a natural time travel story—adhering to the known laws of physics—which do not require exceptions to fundamental scientific principles (for example, the invariant and inviolable speed of light). But as a time travel story, they require that the time traveler also be an ordinary traveler, too, that is, that he travel some distance through space at extraordinary speeds. Furthermore, this sort of natural time traveler can only time travel into the future. (Conversely, from the perspective of those in the originating frame of reference, when the astronaut returns, they witness the effects of time travel to the past perhaps because they have a person present among them who was alive in their distant past.) So natural time travel according to Special Relativity is perhaps too limited for what we normally mean by time travel since it requires (considerable) spatial travel in order to work.\n\nIn addition, there are other limitations, not least of which is mass-energy equivalence. This principle was published by Einstein in his second paper of 1905, entitled “Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?” Mass-energy equivalence was implied by certain consequences of Special Relativity (other theorists later discovered that it was suggested by Maxwell’s electromagnetism theory). Mass-energy equivalence is expressed by the famous formula, E = mc2. It means that there is an energy equivalent to the mass of a particle at rest. When we harmonize mass-energy equivalence with the conservation law of energy, we find that if a mass ceases to exist, its equivalent amount of energy must appear in some form. Mass is interchangeable with energy. Now only mass-less objects, like photons, can actually move at the speed of light. They have kinetic energy but no mass energy. Indeed, all objects with mass at rest, like people and spaceships cannot, in principle, attain the speed of light. They would require an infinite amount of energy.\nc. General Relativity\n\nIn Special Relativity, all inertial frames are equivalent, and while this is a useful approximation, it does not yet suggest how inertial frames are to be explained. Mach had stated that the distribution of matter determines space and time. But how? This was the question answered by Einstein in his theory of General Relativity (1916). Special Relativity is actually a subset of General Relativity. General Relativity takes into account accelerating frames of reference (that is, non-inertial frames) and thus, the phenomenon of gravity. The topography of spacetime is created by the distribution of mass. Spacetime is dynamic, it curves, and matter “tells” a region of spacetime how to curve. Likewise, the resultant geometry of a spacetime region determines the motion of matter in it.\n\nThe fundamental principle in General Relativity is the equivalence principle, which states that gravity and acceleration are two names designating the same phenomenon. If you are accelerating upwards at a rate g in an elevator located in a region of spacetime without a gravitational field, the force you would feel and the motion of objects in the elevator with you would be indistinguishable from an elevator that is stationary within a downward uniform gravitational field of magnitude g. To be more precise, there is no “force” of gravity. When we observe astronauts who are in orbit over the Earth, it is not true to say that they are in an environment with no gravity. Rather, they are in free fall within the Earth’s gravitational field. They are in a local inertial frame and thus do not feel the weight of their own mass.\n\nOne curious effect of General Relativity is that light bends when it travels near objects. This may seem strange when we remember that light has no mass. How can light be affected by gravity? Light always travels in straight lines. Light bends because the geometry of spacetime is non-Euclidean in the vicinity of any mass. The curved path of light around a massive body is only apparent; it is simply traveling a geodesic straight line. If we draw the path of an airplane traveling the shortest international route in only two dimensions (like on a flat map), the path appears curved; however, because the earth itself is curved and not flat, the shortest distance, a straight line, must always follow a geodesic path. Light travels along the straight path through the various contours of spacetime. Another curious effect of General Relativity is that gravity affects time. Imagine a uniformly accelerating frame, like a rocket during an engine burn. General Relativity predicts that, depending on one’s location in the rocket, one will measure time differently. To an observer at the bottom or back of the rocket (depending on how you want to visualize its motion), a clock at the top or front of the rocket will appear to run faster. According to the principle of equivalence, then, a clock at sea level on the Earth runs a little slower than a clock at the top of Mount Everest because the strength of the field is weaker the further you are from the center of mass.\n\nAre natural time travel stories possible in General Relativity? Yes, they are, and some of them are quite curious. While most of spacetime seems to be flat or gently rolling contours, physicists are aware of spacetime regions with unusual and severe topologies such as rotating black holes. Black holes are entities that remain from the complete collapse of stars. Black holes are the triumph of gravity over all other forces and are predicted by a solution to Einstein’s General Relativity equations (Kerr, 1963). When they rotate, the singularity of the black hole creates a ring or torus, which might be traversable (unlike the static black hole, whose singularity would be an impenetrable point). If an intrepid astronaut were to position herself near the horizon of the rapidly spinning center of a black hole (without falling into its center and possibly being annihilated), she would be treated to a most remarkable form of time travel. In a brief period of her personal time she would witness an immensely long time span in the universe beyond the black hole horizon; her spacetime region would be so far removed from the external time of the surrounding cosmos that she conceivably could witness thousands, millions, or billions of years elapse. This is a kind of natural time travel; however, it severely restricts the activity of the astronaut/time traveler and she is limited to “travel” into the future. Are there solutions to General Relativity that allow natural time travel into the past? Yes, but unlike rotating black holes, they remain only theoretical possibilities.\n\nEinstein’s neighbor in Princeton, Kurt Gödel, developed one such solution. In 1949, Gödel discovered that some worldlines in closed spacetime could curve so severely that they curved back onto themselves, forming a loop in spacetime. These loops are known as closed timelike curves (CTCs). If you were an object on a CTC worldline, you would eventually arrive at the same spacetime position from which you started, that is, your older self would appear at one of its own earlier spacetime points. Gödel’s CTC spacetime describes a rotating universe; thus, it is an extreme case for a CTC because it is globally intrinsic to the structure of the universe. It is not considered a realistic solution since current cosmological theory states that the universe is expanding, not rotating.\n\nOne type of spacetime region that a natural time traveler might exploit is a wormhole: two black holes whose throats are linked by a tunnel. Wormholes would connect two regions of space and two regions of time as well. Physicist Kip Thorne speculated that if one could trap one of the black holes that comprise the mouths of the wormhole it would be conceivable to transport it, preferably at speeds near the speed of light. The moving black hole would age more slowly than the stationary black hole at the other end of the wormhole because of time dilation. Eventually, the two black holes would become unsynchronized and exist in different external times. The natural time traveler could then enter the stationary black hole and emerge from the wormhole some years earlier than when he departed. Unfortunately for our time traveler, if wormholes exist naturally many scientists think that they are probably quite unstable (particularly if quantum effects are taken into account). So, any natural wormhole would require augmentation from exotic phenomena like negative energy in order to be useful as a time machine.\n\nAnother type of CTC suggested by Gott (1991) employs two infinitely long and very fast moving cosmic “strings” of extremely dense material. The atom-width strings would have to travel parallel to one another in opposite directions. As they rush past one another, they would create severely curved spacetime such that spacetime curved back on itself. The natural time traveler would be prepared to exploit these conditions at just the right moment and fly her spaceship around the two strings. If executed properly, she would return to her starting point in space but at an earlier time.\n\nOne common feature of all CTCs, whether it is the global Gödelian rotating universe or the local regions of rolled-up spacetime around a wormhole or cosmic strings, is that they are solutions to General Relativity that would describe CTCs as already built into the universe. The natural time traveler would have to seek out these structures through ordinary travel and then exploit them. So far, we are not aware of any solution to General Relativity that describes the evolution of a CTC in a spacetime region where time travel had not been possible previously; however, it is usually assumed that there are such solutions to the equations. These solutions would entail particular physical constraints. One constraint would be the creation of a singularity in a finite region of spacetime. To enter the region where time travel might be possible, one would have to cross the Cauchy horizon, the hourglass-shaped (for two crossing cosmic strings) boundary of the singularity in which the laws of physics are unknown. Were such a CTC constructed, a second constraint would limit the external time that would be accessible to the time traveler. You could not travel to a time prior to the inception date of the CTC. (For more on this sort of time travel, see Earman, Smeenk, and Wüthrich, 2002.)\n\nNatural time travel according to General Relativity faces daunting technological challenges especially if you want to have some control over the trajectory of your worldline. One problem already mentioned is that of stability. But equally imposing is the problem of energy. Fantastic amounts of exotic matter (or structures and conditions similar to the early moments of the Big Bang, like membranes with negative tension boundary layers, or gravitational vacuum polarization) would be needed to construct and manage a usable wormhole; infinitely long tubes of hyperdense matter would be needed for cosmic strings. Despite these technological challenges, it should be pointed out that the possibility of natural time travel into the past is consistent with General Relativity. But Hawking and other physicists recognize another problem with actual time travel into the past along CTCs: maintaining a physically consistent history within causal loops (see Causation below). One advantage of some interpretations of relativistic quantum theory is that the logical requirement for a consistent history in a time travel story is seemingly avoided by postulating alternative histories (or worlds) instead of one history of the universe.\nd. Quantum Interpretations\n\nCertain aspects of quantum theory are relevant to time travel, in particular the field of quantum gravity. The fundamental forces of nature (strong nuclear force, electromagnetic force, weak nuclear force, and gravitation) have relativistic quantum descriptions; however, attempts to incorporate gravity in quantum theory have been unsuccessful to date. On the current standard model of the atom, all forces are carried by “virtual” particles called gauge bosons (corresponding to the order given above for the forces: mesons and gluons, photons, massive W and Z particles, and the hypothetical graviton). A physicist might say that the photon “carries” electromagnetic force between “real” particles. The graviton, which has eluded attempts to detect it, “carries” gravity. This particle-characterization of gravity in quantum theory is very different from Einstein’s geometrical characterization in General Relativity. Reconciling these two descriptions is a robust area of research and many hope that gravity can be understood in the same way as the other fundamental forces. This might eventually lead to the formulation of a “theory of everything.”\n\nScientists have proposed several interpretations of quantum theory. The central issue in interpretations of quantum theory is entanglement. When two quantum systems enter into temporary physical interaction, mutually influencing one another through known forces, and then separate, the two systems cannot be described again in the same way as when they were first brought together. Microstate and macrostate entanglement occurs when an observer measures some physical property, like spin, with some instrumentation. The rule, according to the orthodox (or Copenhagen) interpretation, is that when observed the state vector (the equation describing the entangled system) reduces or jumps from a state of superposition to one of the actually observed states. But what happens when an entangled state “collapses?” The orthodox interpretation states that we don’t know; all we can say about it is to describe the observed effects, which is what the wave equation or state vector does.\n\nOther interpretations claim that that the state vector does not “collapse” at all. Instead, some no-collapse interpretations claim that all possible outcomes of the superposition of states become real outcomes in one way or another. In the many-worlds version of this interpretation (Everett, 1957), at each such event the universe that involves the entangled state exfoliates into identical copies of the universe, save for the values of the properties included in the formerly entangled state vector. Thus, at any given moment of “collapse” there exist two or more nearly identical universes, mutually unobservable yet equally real, that then each divide further as more and more entangled events evolve. On this view, it is conceivable that you were both born and not born, depending on which world we’re referring to; indeed, the meaning of ‘world’ becomes problematic. The many universes are collectively designated as the multiverse. There are other variations on the many-worlds interpretation, including the many minds version (Albert and Loewer, 1988) and the many histories version (Gell-Mann and Hartle, 1989); however, they all share the central claim that the state vector does not “collapse.”\n\nMany natural time travel stories make use of these many-worlds conceptions. Some scientists and storytellers speculate that if we were able to travel through a wormhole that we would not be traversing a spacetime interval in our own universe, but instead we would be hopping from “our” universe to an alternative universe. A natural time traveler in a many-worlds universe would, upon their return trip, enter a different world history. This possibility has become quite common in Wellsian time travel stories, for example, in Back to the Future and Terminator. These types of stories suggest that through time travel we can change the outcome of historical events in our world. The idea that the history of the universe can be changed is why many of the inconsistencies with causation and personal identity arise. We now turn to these topics to examine the philosophical implications of time travel stories.\n5. Causation\n\nInconsistencies and incoherence in time travel stories often result from spurious applications of causation. Causation describes the connected continuity of events that change. The nature of this relation between events, for example, whether it is objective or subjective, is a subject of debate in philosophy. But for our purposes, we need only notice that events generally appear to have causes. The distinction made between external and personal time is crucial now for the difficulties of causation in some time travel stories.\n\nImagine Heloise is a time traveler who travels 80 years in the past to visit Harold. They have a fight and Heloise knocks out one of Harold’s teeth. If we follow the progression of Heloise’s personal time (or of Harold’s), the story is consistent; indeed, time travel seems to have little effect upon the events described. The difficulty arises when we test the consistency of the story in external time, because it involves an earlier event being affected by a later event. The ordinary forward progress of events related to Harold 80 years ago requires a schism in the connectivity and continuity of those events to allow the entry of a later event, namely, Heloise’s time travel journey. The activity of Heloise is causally continuous with respect to her personal time but not with respect to external time (assuming that the continuity of her personal identity is not in question, as we shall discuss in the next section). With respect to external time, this story describes reversed causation, for later events produce changes in earlier events. How does the story change if Heloise is homicidal and encounters her own grandfather 80 years ago? This is a scenario many think show that time travel into the past is inconsistent and thus impossible.\na. The Grandfather Paradox\n\nHeloise despises her paternal grandfather. Heloise is homicidal and has been trained in various lethal combat techniques. Despite her relish at the thought of murdering her grandfather, time has conspired against her, for her grandfather has been dead for 30 years. As a crime investigator might say, she has motive and means, but lacks the opportunity; that is, until she fortuitously comes into the possession of a time machine. Now Heloise has the opportunity to fulfill her desire. She makes the necessary settings on the machine and plunges back into time 80 years. She emerges from the machine and begins to stalk her grandfather. He suspects nothing. She waits for the perfect moment and place to strike so that she can enjoy the full satisfaction of her hatred. At this point, we might pause to observe: “If Heloise murders her grandfather, she will have prevented him from fathering any children. That means that Heloise’s own father will not be born. And that means that Heloise will not be born. But if she never comes into existence, then how is she able to return…?” And so we have the infamous grandfather paradox. Before we examine what happens next, let’s consider the possible outcomes of her impending action.\n\nFirst, let’s assume that the many-worlds hypothesis correctly describes the universe. If so, then we avoid the paradox. If Heloise succeeds in killing her grandfather before her father is conceived, then the state of the world includes quantum entanglement of the events involved in Heloise’s mind, body, surrounding objects, etc., such that when she succeeds in killing her grandfather (or willing his death just prior to the physical accomplishment of it), the universe at that moment divides into one universe in which she succeeded and a second universe in which she did not. So the paradox of causal continuity in external time does not arise; causation presumably connects events in the different universes without any inconsistency. But as we shall see in the next section this quantum interpretation trades-off a causation paradox for a personal identity paradox.\n\nNext, let’s assume that we do not have the many-worlds quantum interpretation available to us, nor for that matter, any theory of different worlds. Can Heloise murder her grandfather? As David Lewis famously remarked, in one sense she can, and in another sense she can’t. The sense in which she can murder her grandfather refers to her ability, her willingness, and her opportunity to do so. But the sense in which she cannot murder her grandfather trumps the sense in which she can. In fact, she does not murder her grandfather because the moments of external time that have already passed are no longer separable. Assuming that events 80 years ago did not include Heloise murdering her grandfather, she cannot create another moment 80 years ago that does. A set of facts is arranged such that it is perfectly appropriate to say that, in one sense, Heloise can murder her grandfather. However, this set of facts is enclosed by the larger set of facts that include the survival of her grandfather. Were Heloise to actually succeed in carrying out her murderous desire, this larger set of facts would contain a contradiction (that her grandfather both is murdered and is not murdered 80 years ago), which is impossible. History remains consistent.\n\nThis is also related to Stephen Hawking’s view (1992). According to his so-called Chronology Protection Conjecture, he claims that the laws of physics conspire to prevent macroscopic inconsistencies like the grandfather paradox. A “Chronology Protection Agency” works through events like vacuum fluctuations or virtual particles to prevent closed trajectories of spacetime curvature in the negative direction (CTCs). If Hawking is right and many-worlds quantum interpretations are not available, then is time travel to the past still possible? Hawking’s view about consistent history then takes us to the special case of causation paradoxes: the causal loop.\nb. Causal Loops\n\nA causal loop is a chain of causes that closes back on itself. A causes B, which causes C,…which causes X, which causes A, which causes B…and so on ad infinitum. This sequence of events is exploited in some natural and Wellsian time travel stories. It is a point of debate whether all time travel stories involving travel to the past include causal loops. As we have seen, causal loops can occur when extraordinary cosmic structures curve spacetime in a negative direction. Wellsian time travel stories with causal loops describe scenarios like the following one by Keller and Nelson (2001).\n\nJennifer, a young teenager, is visited by an old woman who materializes in her bedroom. The old woman describes intimate details that only Jennifer would know and thus convinces Jennifer to pursue a professional tennis career. Jennifer does exactly as the old woman suggested and eventually retires, successful and happy. One day she comes into the possession of a time machine and decides to use it to travel back in time so that she might try to make her teenage years happier. Jennifer travels back into the past and stands before a person she recognizes as her younger self. Jennifer begins to talk to the teenager about her hidden talents and the bright future before her as a tennis professional. At the end of their conversation, Jennifer activates the time machine and returns to her original time. We can describe the causal loop in Keller and Nelson’s story as follows. The story contained within in the causal loop is presented on the left side. At event C, the story splits, with the causal loop continuing along C1, and the exit from the loop beginning at C2. At C2, the worldline of Jennifer continues outside the causal loop events. Thus:\n\ntimetravel5\n\nThe events of Jennifer’s life include a causal loop: some of those events have no beginning and no end. What is the problem with the story? Each moment of the causal sequence is explicable in terms of the prior events. But where (or when) did the crucial information that Jennifer would have a successful tennis career come from originally? While each part of the causal sequence makes sense, the causal loop as a whole is surprising because it includes information ex nihilo. It is controversial whether such uncaused causes are possible. Some philosophers (for example, Mellor, 1998) think that causal loop time travel stories are impossible because causal loops are themselves impossible. They argue that time and causality must progress in the same direction. Other philosophers (for example, Horwich, 1987) argue that while causal loops are not impossible, they are highly implausible, and thus spacetime does not permit time travel into the “local” past (like one’s own life) because fantastic amounts of energy would be required. Still other philosophers (for example, Lewis) think that causal loops are possible because at least some events, like the Big Bang, appear to be events without causes, introducing information ex nihilo.\n\nAccording to Hawking, causal loop stories that employ CTCs are like grandfather paradox stories. While backwards causation might be logically possible, it is not physically possible. The “Chronology Protection Agency” actively prevents them from occurring. The laws of physics conspire such that natural time travel into the past thwarts backwards or reverse causation. In closed spacetime, the Cauchy horizon of a CTC acts as an impenetrable barrier to a timelike worldline for objects. If a time traveler could travel to the past, whether or not that past included their younger self, they are prevented from interacting with the events of the past.\n\nIf causal loops are possible, then the objects may interact with the events of the past, but only in a consistent way, that is, only in a way that preserves the already established events of the past. Perhaps we could call it the CTC prime directive (see Ray Bradbury’s short story “A Sound of Thunder”). Causal loops, like any other aporia of uncaused causes, occupy the inexplicable perimeter of philosophical thought about causation. Nevertheless, causal loop stories like that of Jennifer raise another issue: personal identity.\n6. Personal Identity\n\nThe old Jennifer travels back in time to talk with her younger self. Are there two Jennifers or just one Jennifer at event A? At the same moment in external time, a young Jennifer and an old Jennifer are separated by a distance of a few feet. At that moment, is there one person or two? Identity theory involves the relationships between the mind and the body that attempts to show the connection between mental states and physical states (see the entry Personal Identity). It tries, for example, to describe and explain the connection (if any) between mind and the brain. For Lewis, the mental/physical distinction is crucial for explaining how a time traveler like Jennifer is one person, even when she travels back to talk with her younger self. Our cognitions change according to the requirement of causal continuity. These mental states occur in personal time. For everyday purposes, we can ignore the distinction between personal time and external time; personal time and external time coincide. But for a time traveler like Jennifer, identity is maintained only by virtue of the traveler’s personal time; their mental states continue like anyone else’s and at any given point in personal time, later mental states do not cause earlier ones.\n\nIn the case of Jennifer, it is therefore proper to say that at event A in her life, there is only one person, even though it is also true to say from an external perspective, that she has two different bodies present at event A. Lewis’s distinction between the sense in which you can and the sense in which you can’t has its coda in the subject of personal identity. In the sense of personal time, Jennifer is one person who is perceiving another person (from either Jennifer’s perspective). The older Jennifer’s materialization into the presence of the younger Jennifer is strange, to be sure, but in a time travel story, it is explicable. Regardless, in her personal time, the causal continuity of her perception (and thus mental states) is consistent. In the sense of external time, from the perspective of their surrounding world, there are two Jennifers at event A. The mental state of the younger Jennifer is not identical to the mental state of the older Jennifer. But these mental states, these stages of Jennifer’s life are not duplicates of the same stage; rather, two moments of personal time overlap at one moment of external time. So is it still proper to say that there are two of her? Lewis argues no, it is not. In the strange case of a time traveler like Jennifer, her stages are scattered in such a way that they do not connect in a continuously forward direction through external time, but they do connect continuously forward through her personal time. The time traveler who meets up with her younger self gives the appearance to an outside observer that she is two different people, but in reality, there is only one person.\n\nThe question of how objects persist through time is the subject of the endurance and perdurance debate in philosophy. An endurantist is someone who thinks that objects are wholly present at each moment of an interval of time. A perdurantist is someone who thinks that objects only have a temporal part present at each moment of an interval of time. The perdurantist claims that the identity of the whole object is identified as the sum of these temporal parts over the lifetime of the object. It seems that it is impossible for an endurantist to believe the story about Jennifer because she would have to be wholly present in two different spatial locations at the same time. The endurantist can avoid this problem by appealing to the distinction between personal time and external time. If Jennifer is wholly present at different locations “at the same time,” which kind of time do we mean? We mean external time. The endurantist can claim that two different temporal stages in her personal time just so happen to coincide because she is a time traveler at different locations at a single moment of external time. For those of us who are not time travelers, our different temporal stages are also distinct moments in external time. But in either case, whether time traveler or not, a person is wholly present at any moment of their personal time.\n\nThe perdurantist seems to have an easier way with the problem of personal identity in time travel stories. Since a person is only partially present at each moment of external time, it is readily conceivable that different temporal parts might coincide, but we still need to appeal to the distinction between personal time and external time. The two temporal parts of Jennifer’s life that occur when the young and old Jennifer meet and have a conversation are each elements among many others that in toto form the whole person.\n\nPersonal identity is especially problematic in a many-worlds hypothesis. Consider the case of Heloise and her desire to murder her grandfather. According to the many-worlds hypothesis, she travels back in time but by doing so also skips into another universe. Heloise is free to kill her grandfather because she would not be killing “her” grandfather, that is, the same grandfather that she knew about before her time travel journey. Indeed, Heloise herself may have split into two different persons. Whatever she does after she travels into the past would be consistent with the history of the alternative universe. But the question of who exactly Heloise or her grandfather is becomes problematic, especially if we assume that her actions in the different universes are physically distinct. Is Heloise the sum of her appearances in the many worlds? Or is each appearance of Heloise a unique person?",

      "text": " Address by Adolf Hitler, Chancellor of the Reich, before the Reichstag, September 1, 1939.\n\nFor months we have been suffering under the torture of a problem which the Versailles Diktat created - a problem which has deteriorated until it becomes intolerable for us. Danzig was and is a German city. The Corridor was and is German. Both these territories owe their cultural development exclusively to the German people. Danzig was separated from us, the Corridor was annexed by Poland. As in other German territories of the East, all German minorities living there have been ill-treated in the most distressing manner. More than 1,000,000 people of German blood had in the years 1919-1920 to leave their homeland.\n\nAs always, I attempted to bring about, by the peaceful method of making proposals for revision, an alteration of this intolerable position. It is a lie when the outside world says that we only tried to carry through our revisions by pressure. Fifteen years before the National Socialist Party came to power there was the opportunity of carrying out these revisions by peaceful settlements and understanding. On my own initiative I have, not once but several times, made proposals for the revision of intolerable conditions. All these proposals, as you know, have been rejected - proposals for limitation of armaments and even, if necessary, disarmament, proposals for limitation of warmaking, proposals for the elimination of certain methods of modern warfare. You know the proposals that I have made to fulfill the necessity of restoring German sovereignty over German territories. You know the endless attempts I made for a peaceful clarification and understanding of the problem of Austria, and later of the problem of the Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia. It was all in vain.\n\nIt is impossible to demand that an impossible position should be cleared up by peaceful revision and at the same time constantly reject peaceful revision. It is also impossible to say that he who undertakes to carry out these revisions for himself transgresses a law, since the Versailles Diktat is not law to us. A signature was forced out of us with pistols at our head and with the threat of hunger for millions of people. And then this document, with our signature, obtained by force, was proclaimed as a solemn law.\n\nIn the same way, I have also tried to solve the problem of Danzig, the Corridor, etc., by proposing a peaceful discussion. That the problems had to be solved was clear. It is quite understandable to us that the time when the problem was to be solved had little interest for the Western Powers. But that time is not a matter of indifference to us. Moreover, it was not and could not be a matter of indifference to those who suffer most.\n\nIn my talks with Polish statesmen I discussed the ideas which you recognize from my last speech to the Reichstag. No one could say that this was in any way an inadmissible procedure on undue pressure. I then naturally formulated at last the German proposals, and I must once more repeat that there is nothing more modest or loyal than these proposals. I should like to say this to the world. I alone was in the position to make such proposal, for I know very well that in doing so I brought myself into opposition to millions of Germans. These proposals have been refused. Not only were they answered first with mobilization, but with increased terror and pressure against our German compatriots and with a slow strangling of the Free City of Danzig - economically, politically, and in recent weeks by military and transport means.\n\nPoland has directed its attacks against the Free City of Danzig. Moreover, Poland was not prepared to settle the Corridor question in a reasonable way which would be equitable to both parties, and she did not think of keeping her obligations to minorities.\n\nI must here state something definitely; German has kept these obligations; the minorities who live in Germany are not persecuted. No Frenchman can stand up and say that any Frenchman living in the Saar territory is oppressed, tortured, or deprived of his rights. Nobody can say this.\n\nFor four months I have calmly watched developments, although I never ceased to give warnings. In the last few days I have increased these warnings. I informed the Polish Ambassador three weeks ago that if Poland continued to send to Danzig notes in the form of ultimata, and if on the Polish side an end was not put to Customs measures destined to ruin Danzig's trade, then the Reich could not remain inactive. I left no doubt that people who wanted to compare the Germany of to-day with the former Germany would be deceiving themselves.\n\nAn attempt was made to justify the oppression of the Germans by claiming that they had committed acts of provocation. I do not know in what these provocations on the part of women and children consist, if they themselves are maltreated, in some cases killed. One thing I do know - that no great Power can with honour long stand by passively and watch such events.\n\nI made one more final effort to accept a proposal for mediation on the part of the British Government. They proposed, not that they themselves should carry on the negotiations, but rather that Poland and Germany should come into direct contact and once more pursue negotiations.\n\nI must declare that I accepted this proposal, and I worked out a basis for these negotiations which are known to you. For two whole days I sat in my Government and waited to see whether it was convenient for the Polish Government to send a plenipotentiary or not. Last night they did not send us a plenipotentiary, but instead informed us through their Ambassador that they were still considering whether and to what extent they were in a position to go into the British proposals. The Polish Government also said that they would inform Britain of their decision.\n\nDeputies, if the German Government and its Leader patiently endured such treatment Germany would deserve only to disappear from the political stage. But I am wrongly judged if my love of peace and my patience are mistaken for weakness or even cowardice. I, therefore, decided last night and informed the British Government that in these circumstances I can no longer find any willingness on the part of the Polish Government to conduct serious negotiations with us.\n\nThese proposals for mediation have failed because in the meanwhile there, first of all, came as an answer the sudden Polish general mobilization, followed by more Polish atrocities. These were again repeated last night. Recently in one night there were as many as twenty-one frontier incidents: last night there were fourteen, of which three were quite serious. I have, therefore, resolved to speak to Poland in the same language that Poland for months past has used toward us. This attitude on the part of the Reich will not change.\n\nThe other European States understand in part our attitude. I should like here above all to thank Italy, which throughout has supported us, but you will understand that for the carrying on of this struggle we do not intend to appeal to foreign help. We will carry out this task ourselves. The neutral States have assured us of their neutrality, just as we had already guaranteed it to them.\n\nWhen statesmen in the West declare that this affects their interests, I can only regret such a declaration. It cannot for a moment make me hesitate to fulfill my duty. What more is wanted? I have solemnly assured them, and I repeat it, that we ask nothing of those Western States and never will ask anything. I have declared that the frontier between France and Germany is a final one. I have repeatedly offered friendship and, if necessary, the closest co-operation to Britain, but this cannot be offered from one side only. It must find response on the other side. Germany has no interests in the West, and our western wall is for all time the frontier of the Reich on the west. Moreover, we have no aims of any kind there for the future. With this assurance we are in solemn earnest, and as long as others do not violate their neutrality we will likewise take every care to respect it.\n\nI am happy particularly to be able to tell you of one event. You know that Russia and Germany are governed by two different doctrines. There was only one question that had to be cleared up. Germany has no intention of exporting its doctrine. Given the fact that Soviet Russia has no intention of exporting its doctrine to Germany, I no longer see any reason why we should still oppose one another. On both sides we are clear on that. Any struggle between our people would only be of advantage to others. We have, therefore, resolved to conclude a pact which rules out for ever any use of violence between us. It imposes the obligation on us to consult together in certain European questions. It makes possible for us economic co-operation, and above all it assures that the powers of both these powerful States are not wasted against one another. Every attempt of the West to bring about any change in this will fail.\n\nAt the same time I should like here to declare that this political decision means a tremendous departure for the future, and that it is a final one. Russia and Germany fought against one another in the World War. That shall and will not happen a second time. In Moscow, too, this pact was greeted exactly as you greet it. I can only endorse word for word the speech of Russian Foreign Commissar, Molotov.\n\nI am determined to solve (1) the Danzig question; (2) the question of the Corridor; and (3) to see to it that a change is made in the relationship between Germany and Poland that shall ensure a peaceful co-existence. In this I am resolved to continue to fight until either the present Polish government is willing to continue to bring about this change or until another Polish Government is ready to do so. I am resolved t remove from the German frontiers the element of uncertainty, the everlasting atmosphere of conditions resembling civil war. I will see to it that in the East there is, on the frontier, a peace precisely similar to that on our other frontiers.\n\nIn this I will take the necessary measures to se that they do not contradict the proposals I have already made known in the Reichstag itself to the rest of the world, that is to say, I will not war against women and children. I have ordered my air force to restrict itself to attacks on military objectives. If, however, the enemy thinks he can form that draw carte blanche on his side to fight by the other methods he will receive an answer that will deprive him of hearing and sight.\n\nThis night for the first time Polish regular soldiers fired on our territory. Since 5.45 A.M. we have been returning the fire, and from now on bombs will be met by bombs. Whoever fight with poison gas will be fought with poison gas. Whoever departs from the rules of humane warfare can only expect that we shall do the same. I will continue this struggle, no matter against whom, until the safety of the Reich and its rights are secured.\n\nFor six years now I have been working on the building up of the German defenses. Over 90 millions have in that time been spent on the building up of these defense forces. They are now the best equipped and are above all comparison with what they were in 1914. My trust in them is unshakable. When I called up these forces and when I now ask sacrifices of the German people and if necessary every sacrifice, then I have a right to do so, for I also am to-day absolutely ready, just as we were formerly, to make every possible sacrifice.\n\nI am asking of no German man more than I myself was ready throughout four years at any time to do. There will be no hardships for Germans to which I myself will not submit. My whole life henceforth belongs more than ever to my people. I am from now on just first soldier of the German Reich. I have once more put on that coat that was the most sacred and dear to me. I will not take it off again until victory is secured, or I will not survive the outcome.\n\nShould anything happen to me in the struggle then my first successor is Party Comrade Goring; should anything happen to Party Comrade Goring my next successor is Party Comrade Hess. You would then be under obligation to give to them as Fuhrer the same blind loyalty and obedience as to myself. Should anything happen to Party Comrade Hess, then by law the Senate will be called, and will choose from its midst the most worthy - that is to say the bravest - successor.\n\nAs a National Socialist and as German soldier I enter upon this struggle with a stout heart. My whole life has been nothing but one long struggle for my people, for its restoration, and for Germany. There was only one watchword for that struggle: faith in this people. One word I have never learned: that is, surrender.\n\nIf, however, anyone thinks that we are facing a hard time, I should ask him to remember that once a Prussian King, with a ridiculously small State, opposed a stronger coalition, and in three wars finally came out successful because that State had that stout heart that we need in these times. I would, therefore, like to assure all the world that November 1918 will never be repeated in German history. Just as I myself am ready at any time to stake my life - anyone can take it for my people and for Germany - so I ask the same of all others.\n\nWhoever, however, thinks he can oppose this national command, whether directly of indirectly, shall fall. We have nothing to do with traitors. We are all faithful to our old principle. It is quite unimportant whether we ourselves live, but it is essential that our people shall live, that Germany shall live. The sacrifice that is demanded of us is not greater than the sacrifice that many generations have made. If we form a community closely bound together by vows, ready for anything, resolved never to surrender, then our will will master every hardship and difficulty. And I would like to close with the declaration that I once made when I began the struggle for power in the Reich. I then said: \"If our will is so strong that no hardship and suffering can subdue it, then our will and our German might shall prevail.\" ",

      "text": "   \nThe proof of the endowment of a true artist is always to be found in the fact that his work of art expresses the general will of a period. Perhaps that is most clearly shown in architecture .... The religious mystical world of the Christian Middle Ages, turning inwards upon itself, found forms of expression which were possible only for that world.  A Gothic stadium is as unthinkable as a Romanesque railway station or a Byzantine market hall. The way in which the artist of the Middle Ages, of the beginnings of the modern world, found the artistic solution for the buildings which he was commissioned to create is in the highest degree striking and admirable. \nThat way, however, is no evidence that the conception of the content of life held by the folk of his day was in itself either absolutely right or absolutely wrong.  It is evidence only that works of art have rightly mirrored the inner mind of a past age. It is therefore quite comprehensible that insofar as the attempt is made to carry on the life of that past age, those who search for solutions of artistic problems can still seek and find there fruitful suggestions. \nCONTRADICTION BETWEEN CHRISTIAN ART AND NATIONAL SOCIALIST ART \nThus one can easily imagine that, for instance, in the sphere of religion men will always work backwards to the form-language of a period in which Christianity appeared to meet every need. \nOn the other hand, at the present moment, the expression of a new view of the world which is determined by the conception of race will return to those ages which in the past have already possessed a similar freedom of the spirit, of the will, and of the mind. \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF ROME \nThus, naturally, the manifestation in art of a European conception of the State will not be possible through civilizations, as, for example, the civilizations of the Far East, which -- because they are foreign to us -- have no message for our day.  By contrast we shall be influenced in a thousand ways through the evidences and memories of that mighty imperial Power of antiquity which, although in fact destroyed fifteen hundred years ago, still as an ideal force lives on and works on in the imaginations of men. The more nearly the modern State approaches to the imperial idea of the ancient world-power, so more and more will the general character of that civilization be manifested in its influence upon the formation of the style of our own day. \nNational Socialism is not a cult-movement -- a movement for worship; it is exclusively a \"volkic\" political doctrine based upon racial principles. In its purpose there is no mystic cult, only the care and leadership of a people defined by a common blood-relationship. Therefore we have no rooms for worship, but only halls for the people -- no open spaces for worship, but spaces for assemblies and parades. \nWe have no religious retreats, but arenas for sports and playing-fields, and the characteristic feature of our places of assembly is not the mystical gloom of a cathedral, but the brightness and light of a room or hall which combines beauty with fitness for its purpose. In these halls no acts of worship are celebrated, they are exclusively devoted to gatherings of the people of the kind which we have come to know in the course of our long struggle; to such gatherings we have become accustomed and we wish to maintain them. We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. \nSuch folk are not National Socialists, but something else -- in any case, something which has nothing to do with us. At the head of our program there stand no secret surmising but clear-cut perception and straightforward profession of belief. But since we set as the central point of this perception and of this profession of belief the maintenance and hence the security for the future of a being formed by God, we thus serve the maintenance of a divine work and fulfill a divine will -- not in the secret twilight of a new house of worship, but openly before the face of the Lord. \nThere were times when a half-light was the necessary condition for the effectiveness of certain teachings: we live in an age when light is for us the fundamental condition of successful action. It will be a sorry day when through the stealing in of obscure mystic elements the Movement or the State itself issues obscure commissions .... \nIt is even dangerous to issue any commission for a so-called place of worship, for with the building will arise the necessity for thinking out so-called religious recreations or religious rites, which have nothing to do with National Socialism. Our worship is exclusively the cultivation of the natural, and for that reason, because natural, therefore God-willed. Our humility is the unconditional submission before the divine laws of existence so far as they are known to us men: it is to these we pay our respect. Our commandment is the courageous fulfillment of the duties arising from those laws. \nBut for religious rites we are not the authorities, but the churches! If anyone should believe that these tasks of ours are not enough for him, that they do not correspond with his convictions, then it is for him to prove that God desires to use him to change things for the better. In no event can National Socialism or the National Socialist State give to German art other tasks than those which accord with our view of the world. \nThe only sphere in which the Jewish international newspapers still today think that they can attack the new Reich is the cultural sphere. Here they attempt, by a constant appeal to the sentimentality -- untroubled by any sort of knowledge -- of the world-citizens of democracy to bewail the downfall of German culture: in other words, they lament the commercial closing-down of those elements which, as the heralds and exponents of the November Republic, forced their cultural characteristics, as unnatural as they were deplorable, upon the period between the two Empires; and which have now played out their role for good and all.... \nPROCLAMATION OF A NEW ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE \nFortunately, however, despite the short time which the National Socialist leadership has been able to allot to works of culture, positive facts, here too, speak louder than any negative criticism. We Germans can today speak with justice of a new awakening of our cultural life, which finds its confirmation not in mutual compliments and literary phrases, but rather in positive evidences of cultural creative force. German architecture, sculpture, painting, drama, and the rest bring today documentary proof of a creative period in art, which for richness and impetuosity has rarely been matched in the course of human history. And although the Jewish-democratic press magnates in their effrontery even today seek brazenly to turn these facts upside down, we know that the cultural achievements of Germany will in a few years have won from the world respect and appreciation far more unstinted even than that which they now accord to our work in the material field. \nThe buildings which are arising in the Reich today will speak a language that endures, a language, above all, more compelling than the Yiddish babblings of the democratic, international judges of our culture. What the fingers of these poor wretches have penned or are penning the world will -- perhaps unfortunately -- forget, as it has forgotten so much else. But the gigantic works of the Third Reich are a token of its cultural renascence and shall one day belong to the inalienable cultural heritage of the Western world, just as the great cultural achievements of this world in the past belong to us today. \nMoreover, it is naturally not decisive what attitude, if any, foreign peoples take toward our works of culture, for we have no doubt that cultural creative work, since it is the most sensitive expression of a talent conditioned by blood, cannot be understood, far less appreciated, by individuals or races who are not of the same or related blood. Therefore we do not trouble in any way to make German art and culture suit the tastes of international Jewry.... \nANCIENT GREECE \nThe art of Greece is not merely a formal reproduction of the Greek mode of life, of the landscapes and inhabitants of Greece; no, it is a proclamation of the Greek body and of the essential Greek spirit. It does not make propaganda for an individual work, for the subject, or for the artist; it makes propaganda for the Greek world as such, which confronts us in Hellenism. \nAnd so art today will in the same way announce and herald that common mental attitude, that common view of life, which governs the present age. It will do this not because this age entrusts commissions to artists, but because the execution of these commissions can meet with understanding only if it reveals in itself the true essence of the spirit of this age. The mysticism of Christianity, at the period of its greatest intensity, demanded for the buildings which it ordered an architectonic form which not only did not contradict the spirit of the age, but rather helped it to attain that mysterious gloom which made men the more ready to submit to renunciation of self. \nThe growing protest against this crushing of the freedom of the soul and of the will, which had lasted for centuries, immediately opened the way to new forms of expression in artistic creation. The mystic narrowness and gloom of the cathedrals began to recede and, to match the free life of the spirit, buildings became spacious and flooded with light. Mystical twilight gave way before increasing brightness. The unsteady, groping transition of the nineteenth century led finally in our days to that crisis which in one way or another had to find its solution. Jewry, with its bolshevist onslaught, might smash the Aryan States and destroy those native strata of the people whose blood destined them for leadership, and in that case the culture which had hitherto sprung from these roots would be brought to the same destruction.

      "text": "\nAdolf Hitler Speech\nJanuary 30, 1939\n\nOn January 30, 1933, I entered Wilhelmstrasse, filled with deep concern for the future of my people. Today - six years later - I can speak to the first Reichstag in Greater Germany! Truly, perhaps more than another generation, we may be able to gauge the pious meaning of the saying: 'What a turn of God's providence!\n\nSix years were enough to fulfill the dreams of centuries. A year to bring our people into the enjoyment of that unity that was the futile aspiration of many generations. As I see you today gathered around me as representatives of our German people from all parts of the empire and know among you the newly elected men of the Ostmark and the Sudetenland, I again relishes the tremendous impressions of the events of a year in which centuries were realized. How much blood flowed around this destination in vain! How many millions of German men, consciously or unconsciously in the service of this purpose, have gone the bitter road of rapid or painful death for more than a thousand years! How many others were condemned to end life behind fortress and dungeon walls,  that they wanted to give to Greater Germany! How many hundreds of thousands have flowed into the wide world as an endless stream of German emigration, driven by distress and anxiety! For decades thinking of the unfortunate homeland, after generations forgetting it. And now, in one year, the realization of this dream has succeeded. Not without a fight, as thoughtless citizens may believe it.\n\nBefore this year of German unification, there are almost two decades of the fanatical struggle of a political idea.\n\nHundreds of thousands and millions use their entire being, their physical and economic existence for them; took mockery and mockery as willingly as years of shameful treatment, pathetic slander and barely bearable terror. Countless blood-covered dead and injured in all German districts are the witnesses of the fight.\n\nAnd moreover: this success was fought for by an immense volitional effort and by the power of brave and fanatical decisions. I express this because there is the danger that those who have the least practical share in the success of German unification are only too likely to claim the deed of creating this empire as the most lucrative declamators, or the whole event of the year 1938 as a long overdue, but unfortunately accepted by National Socialism late accepted as matter of course.\n\nTo these elements, I would like to say that the enforcement of this year included a nervous force of which such weights do not have a trace! These are the old, incorrigible pessimists, skeptics, or indifferent people, whom we have always been able to miss as a positive element during our twenty-year struggle, but who now believe they must make their critical marginal notes after winning the nomination of the national experts.\n\nREVIEW OF 1938\n\nIn a few sentences I give a factual account of the historical events of the memorable year 1938.\n\nOn Friday evening (March 11, 1938) the request was made to me, in order to prevent obvious inner confusion in this country, to give the order to invade the German troops. Already at 10 o'clock at night the border crossings took place in numerous places. From 6 o'clock in the morning began the general invasion, which took place under the immense rejoicing of a now finally liberated population.\n\nThen came the Sudeten crisis.\n\nThe responsible man for that development, which gradually made Czechoslovakia the exponent of all hostile intentions directed against the Reich, was the former President of the Republic. Benesch. He has at the suggestion and with the participation of certain foreign circles  In May of last year, the Czech mobilization was carried out, based on the intention to provoke firstly the German Reich and secondly to inflict on the German Reich a defeat in its international reputation. \n\nThe fictitious report of a German mobilization allegedly forcing Czechoslovakia to mobilize its armed forces was maintained and propagated, despite an official declaration twice conveyed at my bidding to the Czech State President Benes, stating that Germany had not mobilized even a single soldier, and in spite of identical assertions to representatives of foreign powers. Insistent demands called for Germany to countermand the fictitious mobilization order and to renounce its pretenses. Benes labored to spread the rumor that the determined nature of the steps he had taken had forced the German Reich back within its appropriate borders. Since the Reich had neither mobilized its forces nor entertained any intentions of attacking Czechoslovakia, this situation  entailed without a doubt a serious loss of prestige for the Reich.\n\n         Because of this unbearable provocation, which was intensified by a truly infamous persecution and terrorization of our Germans there, I decided to finally and now radically resolve the Sudeten German question. I gave on May 28:\n\n1.                   The order to prepare the military intervention against this state with the date of 2 October,\n\n2.                   I ordered the massive and accelerated expansion of our defense front in the West.\n\nFor the confrontation with Mr. Benesch and for the protection of the Reich against other interference attempts or even threats the immediate mobilization of at first 96 divisions was intended, which could follow in a short time a larger number of further such federations.\n\nIf certain newspapers and politicians in the rest of the world now claim that Germany had thereby threatened other peoples with military blackmail, this is due to a gross distortion of the facts. In an area where neither Englishmen nor other Western nations have anything to look for, Germany has established the right of self-determination for ten million German nationals. It did not threaten anyone, it only defended itself against the attempt of third party intervention. And I do not need to assure you, my deputies, men of the German Reichstag, that we will not accept it in the future, that in certain matters, which are only for us, Western states simply try to get into it, to arrive at natural and sensible solutions by intervening prevent! We were all happy, therefore, that thanks to the initiative of our friend Benito Mussolini, and thanks to Chamberlain's and Daladier's high degree of appreciation, we succeeded in finding the elements of an agreement that allowed not only the peaceful resolution of an urgent matter, but beyond can be taken as an example for the possibility of a general rational treatment and resolution of certain vital problems. However, without the determination to resolve this problem one way or another, such an agreement of the European powers would not have come about. to find the elements of an agreement that not only allowed the peaceful resolution of an urgent matter, but could also serve as an example of the possibility of a general rational treatment and resolution of certain vital problems. However, without the determination to resolve this problem one way or another, such an agreement of the European powers would not have come about. to find the elements of an agreement that not only allowed the peaceful resolution of an urgent matter, but could also serve as an example of the possibility of a general rational treatment and resolution of certain vital problems. However, without the determination to resolve this problem one way or another, such an agreement of the European powers would not have come about.\n\n1938: HISTORY MAKING MOMENT: THE UNIFICATION OF GERMANY\n\nWe have before us today a representation of the German people, which can claim to be regarded as a truly constitutional body.\n\nThe politically and socially disorganized German people of earlier decades has consumed most of their inherent powers in an inferior as well as unreasonable internal war. The so-called democratic freedom of living out of opinions and instincts did not lead to a development or even to the liberation of special values ​​or powers, but only to their senseless waste and finally to the paralysis of any truly creative personality that still exists. By putting an end to this unfruitful struggle, National Socialism redeemed the forces that had hitherto been internally bound and made them free to represent the national interests of life in the sense of coping with great communal tasks within the Reich.\n\nMISSION AHEAD\n\nIt is nonsensical to think that obedience and discipline are necessary only for soldiers, but have little useful meaning in the rest of the peoples' lives. On the contrary, the disciplined and obediently popular community is capable of mobilizing forces that facilitate an easier assertion of the peoples' existence and thus serve the successful representation of the interests of all. However, such a community is primarily not created by the compulsion of violence, but only by the compelling power of an idea and thus by the efforts of a continuous education.\n\nThere are people to whom even the greatest and most devastating events can not overcome any inner thoughtfulness or even movement. These are personally internally dead and thus worthless for a community. They do not make history themselves, and you can not make history with them. In their narrowness or in their blatant decadence, they are a useless commodity of nature.\n\nThey find their own reassurance or satisfaction in the thought of a sublime attitude, or rather, ignorance, due to their supposed wisdom or wisdom over the events of time. One can very well imagine that a people does not possess a single such ignoramus, and thereby is capable of the greatest actions and deeds. But it is impossible to conceive of or even lead a nation that would consist in its majority of such ignoramuses, rather than the bloody mass of idealistic, believing, and affirming people. These are the only valuable elements of a national community. A thousand weaknesses are to be forgiven them, if they only have the one strength to give for an ideal or an idea - if necessary - even the last!\n\nMy honorable Members, we are still facing tremendous, enormous tasks! A new leadership layer of our people must be built. Their composition is racial. But it is also necessary, through the system and the nature of our education, to demand and ensure above all bravery and responsibility as a natural prerequisite for the assumption of every public office.\n\nFor the occupation of leading positions in state and party, the attitude of character is to be valued higher than the so-called merely scientific or supposed mental fitness.\n\nFor wherever there is a need to be led, it is not the abstract knowledge that decides, but the innate ability to lead and, consequently, a high degree of responsibility, and thus of determination, courage and perseverance.\n\nBasically, there must be a recognition that the lack of a sense of responsibility can never be outweighed by a presumed first-class, testified scientific education. Knowledge and leadership, that means also energy, are not mutually exclusive. Wherever doubt arises, knowledge can under no circumstances be considered a substitute for attitude, courage, bravery, and determination. In the leadership of a national community in party and state these characteristics are the more important ones.\n\nWhen I say this in front of you, Members of Parliament, I am under the impression of the one year of German history that has taught me more than all my life so far about how important and irreplaceable these virtues are, and how in the critical hours a single energetic man weighs more and more than 1000 clever weaklings! This new selection of leaders must be redeemed as a social phenomenon, but also from numerous prejudices, which I can really call no other than a lying and in the deepest nonsensical social morality.\n\nThere is no attitude that could not find its ultimate justification in the benefits it gives to the whole. What is unimportant or even harmful to the existence of the whole can not be regarded as morality in the service of a social order. And above all: a national community is only conceivable under the recognition of laws which are valid for all, ie it is not possible to expect or demand of one the following of principles which in the eyes of the others are either absurd, harmful or even seem unimportant.\n\nGERMAN CONCEPT OF SOCIALISM\n\nI have no understanding of the tendency of dying social strata to separate themselves from real life through a hedge of dried-up and unrealized civil status laws in order to artificially preserve themselves. On the other hand, as long as this only happens in order to ensure a peaceful cemetery for your own death, there is nothing wrong with it. But if you want to present a barrier to progressing life, then the storm of a youth with a rushing forwards will quickly eliminate this old scrub.\n\nToday's German People's State knows no social prejudices. He therefore knows no social special morality. He only knows the laws of life and necessities conceived by reason and knowledge of man.\n\nThe unity of the German national body, whose guarantor you, my deputies, are and will be in the first place, gives me the certainty that, whatever tasks will be assigned to our people, the National Socialist State sooner or later will dissolve! However, whatever the difficulties we may face, the energy and courage of the leadership will master them.\n\n1.                   We are really fighting a tremendous battle, using all the strength and energy of our people and people\n\n2.                   We will win this fight completely, yes we have already won it!\n\nGERMANY STILL FACING GRAVE CRISIS\n\nWhat is the cause of all our economic difficulties? In the overpopulation of our habitat! And here I can hold only one fact and one question to the gentlemen critics in the Western and non-European democracies, the fact that the German people live with 135 people on the square kilometer without any external help and without all the reserves of former times. Plundered by the rest of the world for one and a half decades, burdened with enormous debts, without colonies, it is still nourished and clothed and has no unemployed. And the question: Which of our so-called big democracies would be able to accomplish the same feat? -\n\nOf course, if nature lets the bananas grow into their mouths, they have a better life-struggle than the German farmer, who has to toil all year to cultivate his field. All we are doing is confess that now such a carefree international banana picker criticizes the activities of the German farmer.\n\nThe then occurring state can only be overcome in two ways:\n\n1.                   By additional imports of foodstuffs, ie an increase in the export of German products, taking into account that some of the raw materials for these products must be imported from abroad, leaving only part of the trade results for the purchase of food, or\n\n2.                   The expansion of the living space of our people in order to ensure the problem of German nutrition in the internal cycle of our economy.\n\nSince the second solution is not given at the moment due to the continuing blindness of the former victorious powers, we are forced to deal with the first one, ie we have to export to buy food and, secondly, we have to, partly because of this export Raw materials that we do not own ourselves need to be exported even more in order to additionally secure these raw materials for our economy.\n\nThis constraint is therefore not a capitalist, as may be the case in other countries, but the hardships that can hit a people, namely the concern for the daily bread.\n\nAnd if here by foreign statesmen with, I do not know for what, economic countermeasures threatened, so I can only assure you that in such a case, an economic desperate struggle would begin, which is very easy to fight through for us. Easier, than for the oversaturated other nations, because the motive for our economic struggle would be a very simple, namely: German people live, ie export or die. And I can assure all international doubters, the German people will not die, by no means, but it will live! If necessary, it will provide its leadership with the entire workforce of the new National Socialist community in order to take up and fight through such a struggle. But as far as leadership is concerned,\n\nHowever, a final solution to this problem, and in a reasonable sense, will only come when general human reason prevails over the greed of individual peoples, that is, when one has come to understand that insistence on injustice is not only political also economically useless,   indeed insane.\n\nUnder the circumstances that now exist, there is no other way for us than to continue an economic policy that must try to bring out of the given living space the highest. This requires an ever greater increase in our services and an increase in production. This forces us to intensify our four-year plan. But it also leads to the mobilization of more and more workers. This brings us closer to a new phase of German economic policy.\n\nWhile the goal of our economic management in the first six years of our seizure of power was to bring all idle labor into some useful employment, it is the task in the years ahead to undertake a careful survey of our workforce, to regularize their use by one Rationalization and, above all, technically better organization of our working conditions with the same work effort to achieve increased benefits and thus also save labor for new additional productions.\n\nThis, in turn, forces us to release the capital market to a greater extent for the technical expansion of our enterprises and thus relieve us of the state requirements.\n\nBut all of this again leads to the need for a sharp combination of economy and finance. It is my decision to conclude the path already taken since January 30, 1937, of transforming the German Reichsbank from an internationally-influenced banking company into the music institute of the German Reich.\n\nIf the rest of the world complains in part that another German enterprise would lose the traits of an international nature, it is only said that it is our inexorable decision to lend all facilities of our life first and foremost German, that is, National Socialist traits , And the rest of the world would only have to see how absurd it is to reproach us, we wish to impose German ideas on the other world, and how much more justified it would be if National Socialist Germany tried to lament that the other world was still trying to to impose their views on us.\n\nI now see it, my deputies of the Reichstag, as the duty of every German man and every German woman to understand the leadership of the Reich in its economic policy and to support it by all means. In town and country, above all, it should be borne in mind that the basis of German economic policy is not to be found in any financial theories at all, but in a very primitive production knowledge, that is, in understanding of the all-important level of goods production. It is regrettable, but not changeable, that additional tasks have to be set for us, that is, that we must employ a large percentage of our national labor for the in itself inefficient armaments of our people.\n\nNEED FOR GERMAN MILITARY POWER\n\nUltimately, the economy of today's empire stands and falls with foreign policy security. It is better to see this in good time than too late.\n\nI therefore consider it the supreme task of the National Socialist leadership to do everything humanly possible to strengthen our military strength. I build on the insight of the German people and especially on his memory.\n\nWe have no right to suppose that if Germany ever succumbed to another seizure in the future, its fate would take on a different shape; on the contrary, it is in part even the same men who once threw into the world the great war fire and the to endeavor today, as driving forces or as driven agents in the service of international sedition, to increase enmities so as to prepare a new fight.\n\nAnd above all you, especially my deputies, men of the Reichstag, do not forget one thing:\n\nIn certain democracies, it seems that one of the special prerogatives of political-democratic life is the artificially breeding of hatred of the so-called totalitarian states, that is to raise public opinion against peoples that displace others through a flood of partly disfiguring, partly even fictitious reports Did not harm people and did not want to harm them, who were at most themselves deprived of grave injustice for decades.\n\nIf we defend ourselves against such war apostles as Mr. Duff Cooper, Mr. Eden, Churchill or Mr. Ikes, etc., then this is considered an interference in the sacred rights of democracies. In the opinion of these gentlemen, they have the right to attack other peoples and their leaders, but no one has the right to resist it.\n\nI do not need to assure them that as long as the German Reich is a sovereign state, the state leadership will not allow an English or American politician to forbid them to respond to such attacks. But the fact that we remain a sovereign state will be ensured in the future by the weapons we are forging, and we will ensure that through the number of our friends.      \n\nIn itself one could dismiss the assertion that Germany intends to attack America with a single laugh. And one would like to ignore the continuous propaganda campaign of certain British war apostles, but we must not neglect the following: \n \n\n1.                   These democracies are states whose political construction makes it possible that just a few months later these worst warmongers can hold in their hands the leadership of the government.\n\n2.                   Therefore, we owe it to the security of the Reich to enlighten the German people in good time about these men. Since the German people felt no hatred of England, America, or France, but wanted their peace and quiet, but these peoples continued to be spurred on by their Jewish or non-Jewish agitators against Germany and the German people, in the event of the intentions of these Advocates of war our own people into a psychologically unprepared and therefore inexplicable situation.\n\n \n\nI therefore think it necessary that from now on in our propaganda and in our press the attacks should always be answered and, above all, brought to the attention of the German people.\n\nIt must know who the men are who want to break a war under all circumstances. I am of the conviction that the calculation of these elements is a false one, for when the National Socialist propaganda first passes to the answer, we will be as successful as we in the inner Germany even by the compelling force of our propaganda thrown the Jewish enemy of the world to the ground to have.\n\nThe peoples will realize in a short time that National Socialist Germany does not want hostility to other peoples, that all the assertions about the intentions of our people to attack foreign peoples are either morbidly hysterical or out of the personal self-preservation addiction of individual politicians, but that lies In certain states conscienceless thieves should serve to save their finances, and that, above all, international Jewry may hope to achieve satisfaction in their vindictiveness and greed for profit, but that they represent the monstrous slander that can be done to a great and peace-loving people.\n\nAMERICAN AGGRESSION VS. GERMANY IN WORLD WAR I\n\nFor example, German soldiers have never fought on American soil except in the service of American independence and liberation struggles, but American soldiers have been brought to Europe to help stifle a great nation struggling to free itself. It was not Germany that attacked America, but America Germany, and as the commission of inquiry of the American House of Representatives has stated: without any compelling cause, only for capitalist reasons.\n\nJEWISH QUESTION AND WESTERN HYPOCRISY ABOUT JEWISH IMMIGRATION\n\nEveryone should be aware of one thing: these attempts, above all, can not in the least affect Germany in the settlement of his Jewish question.\n\nI would like to say the following about the Jewish question:\n\nIt is a shameful spectacle to see today how the whole world drags pity on democracy, and how hardhearted it is for the poor and tormented Jewish people in view of the obvious duty to help. The arguments used to apologize for non-assistance speak only for us Germans and Italians.\n\nBecause one says:\n\n1.                   'We'  the democracies - 'are not in a position to take in the Jews!' There are still 10 people per square kilometer in these world empires, while Germany has 135 to feed on the square kilometer, but still be able to do so.\n\n2.                   It is asserted: We can not take you unless you get from Germany a certain amount of capital to immigration.\n\nHowever, Germany was good enough to absorb these elements for centuries, even though they had nothing but contagious political and sanitary diseases. What this people has today, it has acquired at the expense of the not so cunning German people through the worst manipulations.\n\nToday we only make up for what has caused this people themselves.\n\nWESTERN MURDER OF GERMAN CIVILIANS AND OTHER WAR CRIMES\n\nWhen the rest of the world took away the foreign capital of the German people, when they took all the colonial possessions, the philanthropic considerations of the democratic statesmen apparently had no decisive influence.\n\nToday, I can only assure these gentlemen that, thanks to the brutal education that the democracies have bestowed upon us for fifteen years, we are completely hardened to all sentimental tendencies.\n\nWe have seen that, after more than 800,000 children died of hunger and food shortages at the end of the war, almost a million pieces of dairy cows were driven away after the cruel paragraphs of a dictate imposed by the democratic, humane world apostles impose us as a peace treaty.\n\nWe have seen that one year after the end of the war, more than one million German prisoners of war were detained without any reason in captivity. We had to endure that far more than one and a half million Germans from their frontier areas were being wrenched from their belongings and whipped almost exclusively with what they carried on their bodies.\n\nWe have endured the loss of millions of our fellow citizens without hearing them, or giving them even the slightest chance of further preserving their lives.\n\nI could add dozens of the most gruesome examples to those examples. So stay tuned with humanity. The German people do not want their interests to be determined and governed by a foreign people. France to the French, England to the English, America to the Americans and Germany to the Germans!\n\nMORE ON JEWISH QUESTION\n\nWe are determined to stop the nesting of a foreign people that has been able to seize all leadership and to deport this people. Because we are willing to educate our own people for these leadership positions.\n\nWe have hundreds of thousands of the brightest peasant and working children. We will have them educated, and we are already educating them, and we would like them to once occupy the leading positions in the state with our other educated classes, not the families of a people we do not know.\n\nAbove all, however, German culture is, as its name implies, German and not Jewish, and its administration and care are therefore placed in the hands of our people. But if the rest of the world cries out with hypocritical expression over this barbaric expulsion of such an irreplaceable, culturally valuable element from Germany, then we can only be amazed at the consequences that are drawn from it.\n\nFor how should we be thankful that we release these magnificent cultural bearers and make them available to the other world? She can not, according to her own statements, give a reason for apology, which is why she refuses to admit these most valuable people to her countries.\n\nIt is also difficult to see why the members of this race are otherwise being expected to serve the German people, but in the countries so swarming for these 'splendid people', they suddenly refuse to accept it under all possible excuses. I believe that this problem will be solved all the better.\n\nBecause Europe can not calm down until the Jewish question is resolved.\n\nIt may very well be that sooner or later there will be an agreement in Europe on this problem, even between nations that would otherwise not find their way together. The world has sufficient settlement space, but it must finally be broken with the opinion that the Jewish people are destined by God to be, in a certain percentage, benefactors of the body and of the productive work of other peoples.\n\nJudaism will have to adapt to solid building activity as other peoples do, or it will sooner or later succumb to a crisis of unimaginable proportions.\n\nAnd one thing I would like to say at this perhaps not only for us Germans memorable days: I've been a prophet in my life very often and was mostly laughed at. At the time of my struggle for power, it was primarily the Jewish people who only accepted my prophecies with laughter. Once in Germany I would take over the leadership of the state and thus of the entire people and then, among many others, the Jewish problem Bring solution. I believe that this laudable laughter, meanwhile, has stifled Judaism in Germany already in the throat.\n\nTHREAT TO KILL JEWS\n\nToday I want to be a prophet again: If international financial Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the peoples once again into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Judaism, but annihilation the Jewish race in Europe.\n\nFor the time of the propagandistic defencelessness of non-Jewish peoples is over. National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy possess those institutions which, if necessary, may enlighten the world of the nature of a question which is instinctively conscious to many peoples and only scientifically unclear.\n\nAt present, Judaism may, in certain states, conduct its incitement under the protection of a press, film, radio propaganda, the theater, literature, etc., which it holds in its possession. But if this people succeeds again, the masses of millions of peoples should be united To rush for this completely meaningless and only Jewish interests fight, then the effectiveness of an enlightenment will express itself, which is completely succumbed to the Judaism in Germany already in few years.\n\nThe peoples no longer want to die on the battlefields to earn this rootless international race in the business of war and satisfy their Old Testament vengeance. On the Jewish slogan 'proletarians of all countries, unite' will win a higher realization, namely: creating members of all nations, recognize your common enemy!\n\nNOT OPPOSED TO CHURCHES\n\nOne of the allegations raised in the so-called democracies against Germany is that National Socialist Germany is an anti-religious state. I would like to make the following solemn declaration to the entire German people:\n \n\n1. In Germany no one has been persecuted because of his religious attitude, nor will anyone be prosecuted.\n \n\n2. Since January 30, 1933, the National Socialist State has made the following sums available to the two churches in terms of public tax revenues through its state organs:\n \n\nin the financial year 1933: RM 130 million,  \n\nin the financial year 1934: RM 170 million,  \n\nin the financial year 1935: RM 250 million,  \n\nin the financial year 1936: RM 320 million,  \n\nin the financial year 1937: RM 400 million,  \n\nin the financial year 1938: RM 500 million.\n\nIn addition, about 85 million Reichsmark annually from grants from the Länder and about 7 million Reichsmark from grants from the municipalities and associations of municipalities.\n\nBesides, the churches are the largest landowners in the state. The value of their land and forestry possessions exceeds about 10 billion Reichsmarks. The income from this property is estimated at over 300 million a year.\n\nIn addition there are the countless donations, testamentary assignments and, above all, the results of their church collections. Likewise, the Church in the National Socialist State is tax-privileged in various fields and has tax exemptions for donations, bequests etc.\n\nIt is therefore - to say the least - an outrage, especially when foreign politicians are in charge of talking about hostility to religion in the Third Reich.\n\nBut if the German churches really regard this situation as unbearable for them, then the National Socialist State is always prepared to make a clear separation of church and state, as is the case in France, America and other countries.\n\nI would now like to ask myself the question: what amounts have France, England or [the] USA in the same period? delivered to their churches by the state through public funds?\n\n         3.   The National Socialist State has neither closed a church nor prevented a service, nor has it ever exerted any influence on the form of a service. He did not influence the teaching nor the confession of any denomination. In the National Socialist state, everyone can be saved in his own way.\n\nHowever, the National Socialist state will unblinkingly convince priests, who, instead of being servants of God, want to see their mission in the vilification of our present Reich, its institutions or its leading minds, that no one tolerates the destruction of this state, and that priests, as soon as they are outside the law, will be held accountable by law as much as any other German citizen.\n\nHowever, it must be stated here that there are tens of thousands and tens of thousands of priests of all Christian denominations who fulfill their ecclesiastical duties as well or probably better than the political agitators, without ever having been in conflict with state laws. To protect these, the state regards as its task. To destroy the enemies of the state is his duty!\n \n\n4 .    The National Socialist state is neither prude nor false. But there are certain moral principles that are in the interest of the biological health of a people, which we therefore do not allow to shake. Pederasty or child molesting are punishable by law in this state, no matter who commits these crimes.\n\nWhen heads of the National Socialist Party were guilty of these crimes five years ago, they were shot. If other persons of public or private life or even priests commit the same offenses, they will be punished according to the law with prison or penitentiary. We are not interested in transgressions of priests against their other vows of chastity, etc. There has never been a word in our press about it.\n\nIncidentally, this state intervened only once in the internal order of the churches, namely, when I tried in 1933 to unite the powerless, splintered Protestant churches in Germany into a large and powerful Protestant imperial church. This failed because of the resistance of individual state bishops. Thus this attempt has also been abandoned; After all, it is not our task to defend or strengthen the Protestant church by force against its own bearers.\n\nWESTERN SILENCE ABOUT SOVIET MASS MURDERS\n\nIf foreign countries, and especially certain democratic statesmen, advocate so much for individual German priests, then this can have only one political reason. For the same statesmen were silent when hundreds of thousands of priests had been slaughtered or burnt in Russia; they remained silent when in Spain tens of thousands of priests and nuns were slaughtered in the most vivacious ways, or given to fire in a living body.\n\nThey could not deny these facts, but they remained silent and silent silently, while - I must reproach this to the democratic statesmen - on the basis of these massacres numerous National Socialist and fascist volunteers made available to General Franco to further expand this Bolshevist bloodlust over Europe and help prevent it over the majority of civilized humanity.\n\nFor it was the concern for European culture and for the real civilization that made Germany take sides in this struggle of national Spain against its Bolshevik destroyers. It is a sad sign of the mentality in different countries that one can not imagine acting on such unselfish motives. However, National Socialist Germany took part in the uprising of General Franco only on the hot wish that he would be able to save his country from a danger that would almost have succumbed to Germany itself.\n\nIt can not be the sympathy or pity for persecuted servants of God, which mobilizes the interest of democratic citizens in some in Germany with the law conflicting priests, but it is the interest in the German public enemy.\n\nBut here one may take note of one thing:\n\nWe will protect the German priest as servant of God, we will destroy the priest as a political enemy of the German Reich!\n\nWe believe this most likely to prevent a development that - as the experience in Spain shows - would otherwise only lead to a defense of unpredictable extent.\n\nI would basically like to explain the following:\n\nThere seems to be a certain belief in certain circles abroad that the particularly loud statement of sympathy for elements that have come into conflict with the law in Germany could bring relief to their situation. Perhaps one has the hope of being able to exert a terrorist influence in this sense by means of certain journalistic methods on the German government. The opinion is based on a capital mistake.\n\nIn overseas support of certain state-directed companies, we see the final confirmation of their treasonable character!\n\nFor the mere opposition to a regime has never forced sympathy for this democratic foreign country. Nor the persecution or punishment of such a political evildoer. For when was there a stronger opposition in Germany than the National Socialist? Never has an opposition been suppressed, pursued and hounded by more mean means than that of the National Socialist Party. For our own good, we may say that we have never participated in the pity or even the support of such a foreign power.\n\nThis support seems to be intended only for those who intend to destroy the German Reich. For this reason, in every single case, we will see in it only a compelling reason for an intensification of our measures.\n\nGERMAN ALLIANCE WITH ITALY AND JAPAN\n\nIn view of the dangers threatening us, I now find it very fortunate that I have found states in Europe and outside of Europe that, like the German people, must fiercely fight for the assertion of their existence: Italy and Japan.\n\nIn today's occidental world, the Italians are the descendants of ancient Rome, and we Germans, the descendants of the Germanic tribes of the time, are the oldest and thus the longest in touch with each other. In my address at the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, on the occasion of my visit to Italy, I explained that it was a misfortune that the most powerful civilized people of the old world and the young people were forming a new, by the absence of a natural separation and by conditioned by many other circumstances, had to endure centuries of fruitless conflicts. But from this thousand-year-old contact arose a community, which not only is linked by numerous ties in blood, but above all became historically and culturally of immense importance.\n\nWhat Germanism owes in the field of its state organization and thus also its national development and in the field of the general culture of antiquity, is in detail not measurable, in the whole monstrous. Since then almost two millennia have passed. We too have now made a considerable contribution to culture. But we have always remained spiritually close to the Italian people, their cultural and historical past.\n\nThe 19th century brought a stunning same state unification process. The German tribes united in the German Reich, the Italian states in the Kingdom of Italy. In one year, 1866, fate has let both nations fight together for their state reorganization.\n\nToday, for the second time, we are experiencing this similar development. A man of secular proportions was the first to succeed in successfully confronting the democratic intellectual world that had become barren in his people with a new idea and to lead it to victory in a few years' time. What fascism means for Italy is difficult to estimate. What he has done to preserve human culture is the stars.\n\nWho is not crushed on a walk through Rome or Florence by the thought of what fate would have happened to these unique documents of human art and culture if Mussolini and his fascism had failed to save Italy from Bolshevism?\n\nGermany faced this same danger. Here National Socialism has accomplished the miracle of salvation. The belief in a new renaissance of our time now clings to these two states in the intellectual imagination of innumerable people of all races.\n\nThe solidarity of these two regimes is therefore more than a matter of selfish expediency. In this solidarity lies the salvation of Europe from the looming Bolshevist annihilation.\n\nWhen Italy broke through his heroic fight for his right to live in Abyssinia, Germany was his friend. In 1938, fascist Italy repaid this friendship to us in ample measure. May no one in the world err in the decision National Socialist Germany has made towards this friend.\n\nPeace can be useful only if there is no doubt that a war against today's Italy, regardless of its motives, will call Germany to the side of her friend.\n\nAbove all, one should not be advised otherwise by those who in every country vegetate as isolated bourgeois weaklings and can not understand that in the life of nations, as adviser of prudence, there can be courage and honor, in addition to cowardice. As far as National Socialist Germany is concerned, it knows what fate would befall him if an international force ever succeeded in suppressing fascist Italy, no matter what its motivations.\n\nWe recognize the consequences that would result from this and look them icy cold.\n\nThe fate of Prussia from 1805 to 1806 will not be repeated a second time in German history. The weaklings, who were the counselors of the King of Prussia in 1805, have no advice in today's Germany. The National Socialist state recognizes the danger and is determined to prepare for its defense.\n\nI know that not only our own Wehrmacht can cope with the highest military demands, but also the military power of Italy. For as little as the present German army can be judged, according to the old army of the Federal Republic, about the time of 1848, modern fascist Italy can scarcely be considered after the period of Italian state turmoil. Only a hysterical, as incorrigible, as well as tactless, but extremely malignant press can have forgotten in such a short time that only a few years ago it was just as thoroughly embarrassing with its prophecies about the outcome of the Italian campaign in Abyssinia as now again in the evaluation of Franco's national forces in the Spanish campaign.\n\nMen make the story!\n\nBut they also forge the instruments that are appropriate for the design of history, and above all, they give them their breath. But tall men themselves are only the strongest, most concentrated representation of a people.\n\nNational Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are strong enough to ensure peace against anyone, or to resolve decisively and successfully a conflict that was irresponsibly broken up by irresponsible forces!\n\nThis does not mean that we Germans - as written in an irresponsible press every day - want war, but it just means that we\n\n1.                   to understand that other peoples also want to secure their share in the world's goods, which is due to them by virtue of their number, courage, and worth, and that we\n\n2.                   In recognition of these rights, are determined to share common interests.\n\nBut above all, that under no circumstances will we ever shrink from extortionate threats!\n\nOur relationship with Japan, too, is determined by the realization and the determination to put an end to the threatening Bolshevization of a blind world with the utmost determination. The Anti-Comintern Treaty may one day become the focal point of a group of forces whose ultimate goal is none other than to parry the threat to world peace and culture with a satanic phenomenon.\n\nThe Japanese people, who have given us so many examples of brilliant heroism in these last two years, are undoubtedly a fencer at the service of human civilization at one end of the world.\n\nIts collapse would not benefit the European or other cultural nations, but would only lead to the secure Bolshevization of East Asia. Apart from international Judaism interested in it, no people can wish for such a development.\n\nIf in the past years the tremendous endeavors finally reached their goal peacefully, then, as we said at the beginning, we would like to thank our thanks to Mussolini for the other two statesmen, who valued the value of peace during the critical hours Maintaining a wrong. Germany has no territorial claims against England and France except for the reproduction of our colonies. As much as a solution to this question would help to calm the world, these are not problems that alone could cause a warlike conflict.\n\nIf there are any tensions in Europe today, it is primarily attributable to the irresponsible activities of an unscrupulous press, which hardly takes a day to pass without disturbing mankind with alarm messages that are as stupid as they are hypocritical.\n\nWhat various organs allow for world well poisoning here can only be counted as a criminal crime. Recently, attempts have been made to put the radio in the service of this international hate. I would like to give a warning here:\n\nIf the broadcasts from certain countries to Germany do not stop, we will answer them soon. Hopefully then the statesmen of these countries will not come in a short time with the urgent desire to return to their normal state.\n\nFor I still believe that our enlightenment will be more effective than the lying campaign of these Jewish racers. The announcement of American film companies to make anti-Nazi, ie anti-German, films can only move us to have anti-Semitic films produced in our German production in the future. Again, one should not be fooled about the effect. There will be many states and peoples who will have great understanding for such additional instruction in such an important area!\n\nI believe that if the Jewish international press and propaganda laws were to be stopped, the understanding between the peoples would be established very quickly. Only these elements are constantly hoping for a war. But I believe in a long peace.\n\nGERMAN HOPE FOR PEACE WITH ENGLAND AND FRANCE\n\nFor what conflicts of interest exist between England and Germany? I have stated more than enough that there is no German, and especially no National Socialist, who even in his thoughts had the intention of trying to cause trouble for the English Empire. And we also hear from England the voices of reasonably minded people who express the same attitude towards Germany. It would be good luck for the whole world if the two peoples could come to a trusting cooperation. The same applies to our relationship with France.\n\nThese days marks the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of our non-aggression pact with Poland. There is hardly any difference of opinion among the real peacemakers today about the value of this agreement. All you have to do is ask where Europe might have come if this truly redeemable agreement had been broken five years ago. The great Polish Marshal and Patriot [Pilsudski] has rendered his people as great a service as the National Socialist government has done to the Germans. Even in the turbulent months of last year, German-Polish friendship was one of the reassuring aspects of European political life.\n\nOur relationship with Hungary is based on long-established friendship, shared interests and a traditional mutual esteem. Germany has been pleased to be involved in the reparation of the misfortune that had once been inflicted on Hungary.\n\nA state that has been increasingly in the focus of our people since the Great War is Yugoslavia. The esteem that German soldiers once felt for this brave people has since deepened and developed into a sincere friendship. Our economic relations here, as well as with the friendly Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Turkey, are in a rising upswing. The most important reason for this is to seek in the natural supplementing possibility of these countries with Germany.\n\nGermany is happy to have pacified borders today in the west, south and north.\n\nOur relations with the states of the West and the North, ie Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic States, are all the more gratifying, the more the tendencies of turning away from certain war-pregnant in these countries League of Nations pacts.\n\nNobody can be more appreciative of knowing truly friendly neutral states at their borders than Germany. May Czechoslovakia also succeed in finding a way to inner peace and order, which is a relapse into the tendencies of the former President Dr. Ing. Benesch excludes.\n\nThe accession of Hungary and Manchukuo to the Anti-Comintern Pact is a pleasing symptom of the consolidation of world resistance against the Jewish-international-Bolshevik threat to the people.\n\nThe relations between the German Reich and the South American countries are pleasing and are experiencing an increasing economic revival.\n\nOur relationship with the North American Union suffers from a campaign of slander on the pretext that Germany is threatening American independence or the freedom to oppress an entire continent in the service of transparent political or financial interests against the popular-minded states of Europe.\n\nBut we all do not believe that these attempts are identical with the will of the millions of American citizens, who, in spite of opposite gigantic Jewish-capitalist press, radio and film propaganda, can not doubt that all these claims are not true words.\n\nGermany wishes, as with all countries, including America, peace and friendship. It refuses to interfere in American relations and, however, resolutely refuses any American interference in the German.\n\nWhether Germany, for example, maintains economic relations with South or Central American states and conducts business, nobody cares about except these states and us. Germany is certainly a sovereign and great empire and is not subject to the supervision of American politicians. For the rest, I believe that all states today have so many inner problems to solve that it would be a blessing for the peoples if the responsible statesmen were only concerned with their own affairs.\n\nCONCLUSION:  GERMANY NOW UNITED FOR FIRST TIME IN HISTORY\n\nAs far as Germany is concerned, I know from my own experience that the tasks assigned are so great that they almost exceed the capacity of the insight and energy of an individual man. Therefore, I can only assure myself and all my co-workers that we see our life's work solely in the care and preservation of our people and empire, both of which   look back on a millennial glorious history .\n\nMy deputies! Men of the first Reichstag in Greater Germany!\n\nNow when I conclude my declarations today before them, my gaze glides back to the years of struggle and fulfillment behind us. For most, they signify the meaning and content of the whole existence. We know that greater things can no longer be granted to our people and thus to our own lives.\n\nWithout blood sacrifice we have finally succeeded in establishing the great empire of the German people. Nevertheless, we do not want to forget that this process was also associated with painful sacrifices for some. Many beloved traditions, some expensive memories and symbols had to be eliminated by us. Countries have been extinguished, their flags confiscated, their traditions have become less important, but it may help to reassure all that no generation, which has worked on Germany in our history, has been spared similar painful feelings.\n\nSince the earliest German dukes tried to form higher units of wild tribes, this one had to move beyond their pursuit of cherished institutions, expensive memories, male allegiance, and so on.\n\nThis process lasted almost 2,000 years, until a scattered tribes became a people, and from countless countries and states a kingdom became. Now this career of the German nation may essentially be regarded as finished. But with that, the Greater German Reich encloses the whole millennial struggle of our people.\n\nJust as in him flow all flows of the German blood, so in him all past traditions, their symbols and standards, but above all all the great men, the German people once had reason to be proud.\n\nFor in whatever camp they stood in their times, the daring dukes and great kings, the generals and mighty emperors, and around them the enlightened spirits and heroes of the past, they were but the instruments of providence in the process of the birth of a nation.\n\nBy embracing them in grateful reverence in this great empire, the glorious wealth of German history opens up to us.\n\nLet us thank God the Almighty for having blessed our generation and us to experience this time and hour.\n\n \n",

      "text": " Adolf Hitler - Official Speech on the Enabling Act to the Reichstag\nBerlin, March 23, 1933\n Ladies and Gentlemen of the German Reichstag! By agreement with the Reich Government, today the National Socialist German Workers’ Party and the German National People’s Party have presented to you for resolution a notice of motion concerning a “Law for Removing the Distress of Volk and Reich.” The reasons for this extraordinary measure are as follows: In November 1918, the Marxist organizations seized the executive power by means of a Revolution. The monarchs were dethroned, the authorities of Reich and Länder removed from office, and thus a breach of the Constitution was committed. The success of the revolution in a material sense protected these criminals from the grips of justice. They sought moral justification by asserting that Germany or its government bore the guilt for the outbreak of the War.\nThis assertion was deliberately and objectively untrue. In consequence, however, these false accusations in the interest of our former enemies led to the severest oppression of the entire German Volk, and the violation of the assurances given to us in Wilson’s Fourteen Points then led to a time of boundless misfortune for Germany, that is to say the working German Volk.\nAll the promises made by the men of November 1918 proved to be, if not acts of intentional deception, then no less damnable illusions. The “achievements of the Revolution” were, taken in their entirety, agreeable for only the smallest of fractions of our Volk, but for the overwhelming majority, at least insofar as these people were forced to earn their daily bread by honest work, they were infinitely sad. It is understandable that the survival instinct of those parties and men guilty of this development invents a thousand euphemisms and excuses. An objective comparison of the average outcome of the last fourteen years with the promises once proclaimed is a crushing indictment of the responsible architects of this crime unparalleled in German history.\nIn the course of the past fourteen years, our Volk has suffered deterioration in all sectors of life, which could inconceivably have been greater. The question as to what, if anything, could have been worse than in these times is a question which cannot be answered in light of the basic values of our German Volk as well as the political and economic inheritance which once existed. \n  \nIn spite of its lack of mobility in political feelings and positions, the German Volk itself has increasingly turned away from concepts, parties, and associations which, in its eyes, are responsible for these conditions. \n  \nThe number of Germans who inwardly supported the Weimar Constitution in spite of the suggestive significance and ruthless exploitation of the executive power dwindled, in the end, to a mere fraction of the entire nation. \n  \nAnother typical characteristic of these fourteen years was the fact that- apart from natural fluctuations-the curve of developments has shown a constant decline. This depressing realization was one of the causes of the general state of despair. It served to promote the insight into the necessity of thoroughly rejecting the ideas, organizations, and men in which one gradually and rightly began to recognize the underlying causes of our decay. \n  \nThe National Socialist Movement was thus able, in spite of the most horrible oppression, to convert increasing numbers of Germans in terms of spirit and will to defensive action. Now, in association with the other national leagues, it has eliminated the powers which have been ruling since November 1918 within a few short weeks and, by means of a revolution, transferred public authority to the hands of the National Government. On March 5, the German Volk gave its approval to this action. \n  \nThe program for the reconstruction of the Volk and the Reich is determined by the magnitude of the distress crippling our political, moral and economic life. \n  \nFilled with the conviction that the causes of this collapse lie in internal damage to the body of our Volk, the Government of the National Revolution aims to eliminate the afflictions from our völkisch life which would, in future, continue to foil any real recovery. The disintegration of the nation into irreconcilably opposite Weltanschauungen which was systematically brought about by the false doctrines of Marxism means the destruction of the basis for any possible community life. \n  \nThe dissolution permeates all of the basic principles of social order. The completely opposite approaches of the individuals to the concepts of state, society, religion, morality, family, and economy rips open differences which will lead to a war of all against all. Starting with the liberalism of the past century, this development will end, as the laws of nature dictate, in Communist chaos. \n  \nThe mobilization of the most primitive instincts leads to a link between the concepts of a political theory and the actions of real criminals. Beginning with pillaging, arson, raids on the railway, assassination attempts, and so on-all these things are morally sanctioned by Communist theory. Alone the method of individuals terrorizing the masses has cost the National Socialist Movement more than 350 dead and tens of thousands of injured within the course of a few years. \n  \nThe burning of the Reichstag, one unsuccessful attempt within a large-scale operation, is only a taste of what Europe would have to expect from a triumph of this demonical doctrine. When a certain press, particularly outside Germany, today attempts, true to the political lie advanced to a principle by Communism, to link Germany’s national uprising to this disgraceful act, this can only serve to strengthen my resolve to leave no stone unturned in order to avenge this crime as quickly as possible by having the guilty arsonist and his accomplices publicly executed! Neither the German Volk nor the rest of the world has become sufficiently conscious of the entire scope of the operation planned by this organization. \n  \nOnly by means of its immediate action was the Government able to ward off a development which would have shaken all of Europe had it proceeded to its disastrous end. Several of those who fraternize with the interests of Communism both within and outside of Germany, motivated by hatred for the national uprising, would themselves have become victims of such a development. \n  \nIt will be the utmost goal of the National Government to stamp out and eliminate every trace of this phenomenon, not only in the interest of Germany, but in the interest of the rest of Europe. \n  \nIt will not lose sight of the realization that, in doing so, it is not the negative problem of this organization with which it is dealing, but rather the implementation of the positive task of winning the German worker for the National State. Only the creation of a real Volksgemeinschaft, rising above the interests and conflicts of Stände und Klassen, is capable of permanently removing the source of nourishment of these aberrations of the human mind. The establishment of such a solidarity in Weltanschauung in the body of the German politic is all the more important, for only this will make it possible to maintain friendly relations with the non-German powers without regard to the tendencies or Weltanschauungen to which they are subject, for the elimination of Communism in Germany is a purely domestic German affair. It should be in the interests of the rest of the world as well, for the outbreak of Communist chaos in the densely populated German Reich would lead to political and economic consequences particularly in the rest of western Europe, the proportions of which are unfathomable. The inner disintegration of our Volksgemeinschaft inevitably resulted in an increasingly alarming weakening of the authority of the highest levels of leadership. The sinking reputation of the Reich Government- which is the inevitable product of unstable domestic conditions of this type-led to ideas on the part of various parties in the individual Länder which are incompatible with the unity of the Reich. The greatest consideration for the traditions of the Länder cannot erase the bitter realization that the extent of the fragmentation of national life in the past was not only not beneficial, but positively injurious to the world and life status of our Volk. \n  \nIt is not the task of a superior national leadership to subsequently surrender what has grown organically to the theoretical principle of an unrestrained unitarianization. But it is its duty to raise the unity of spirit and will of the leadership of the nation and thus the concept of the Reich as such beyond all shadow of a doubt. \n  \nThe welfare of our communities and Länder-as well as the existence of each German individual-must be protected by the State. Therefore the Reich Government does not intend to dissolve the Länder by means of the Enabling Act. However, it will institute measures which will guarantee the continuity of political intention in the Reich and Länder from now on and for all time. The greater the consensus of spirit and will, the lesser the interest of the Reich for all time in violating the independent cultural and economic existence of the separate Länder. The present habit of the Governments of the Länder and the Reich of mutually belittling each other, making use of the modern means of public propaganda, is completely outrageous. I will under no circumstances tolerate-and the Reich Government will resolve all measures to combat-the spectacle of ministers of German Governments attacking or belittling each other before the world in mass meetings or even with the aid of public radio broadcasts. \n  \nIt also results in a complete invalidation of the legislative bodies in the eyes of the Volk when, even assuming normal times, the Volk is driven to the polls in the Reich or in the individual Länder almost twenty times in the course of four years. The Reich Government will find the way to ensure that the expression of the will of the nation, once given, leads to uniform consequences for both the Reich and the Länder. \n  \nA further reform of the Reich will only ensue from ongoing developments. \n  \nIts aim must be to design a constitution which ties the will of the Volk to the authority of a genuine leadership. The statutory legalization of this reform of the Constitution will be granted to the Volk itself. \n  \nThe Government of the National Revolution basically regards it as its duty, in accordance with the spirit of the Volk’s vote of confidence, to prevent the elements which consciously and intentionally negate the life of the nation from exercising influence on its formation. The theoretical concept of equality before the law shall not be used, under the guise of equality, to tolerate those who despise the laws as a matter of principle or, moreover, to surrender the freedom of the nation to them on the basis of democratic doctrines. The Government will, however, grant equality before the law to all those who, in forming the front of our Volk against this danger, support national interests and do not deny the Government their assistance. \n  \nOur next task, in any case, is to call upon the spiritual leaders of these destructive tendencies to answer for themselves and at the same time to rescue the victims of their seduction. \n  \nIn particular, we perceive in the millions of German workers who pay homage to these ideas of madness and self destruction only the results of an unforgivable weakness on the part of former governments who failed to put a stop to the dissemination of these ideas, the practical implementation of which they were forced to punish. The Government will not allow itself to be shaken by anyone in its decision to solve this problem. Now it is the responsibility of the Reichstag to adopt a clear standpoint for its part. This will change nothing as to the fate of Communism and the other organizations fraternizing with it. In its measures, the National Government is guided by no other factor than preserving the German Volk, and in particular the mass of millions making up its working populace, from unutterable misery. \n  \nThus it views the matter of restoring the monarchy as out of the question at present in light of the very existence of these circumstances. It would be forced to regard any attempt to solve this problem on the part of the individual Länder as an attack on the legal entity of the Reich and take respective action. \n  \nSimultaneously with this political purification of our public life, the Reich Government intends to undertake a thorough moral purging of the German Volkskörper. The entire system of education, the theater, the cinema, literature, the press, and radio-they all will be used as a means to this end and valued accordingly. They must all work to preserve the eternal values residing in the essential character of our Volk. Art will always remain the expression and mirror of the yearning and the reality of an era. The cosmopolitan contemplative attitude is rapidly disappearing. Heroism is arising passionately as the future shaper and leader of political destinies. The task of art is to give expression to this determining spirit of the age. Blut and Rasse will once more become the source of artistic intuition. The task of the government, particularly in an age of limited political power, is to ensure that the internal value of life and the will of the nation to live are given that much more monumental artistic expression in culture. This resolve entails the obligation to grateful appreciation of our great past. The gap between this past and the future must be bridged in all sectors of our historical and cultural life. Reverence for the Great Men must be instilled once more in German youth as a sacred inheritance. In being determined to undertake the political and moral purification of our public life, the government is creating and securing the requirements for a genuinely profound return to religious life. \n  \nThe advantages in personnel policy which might result from compromises with atheist organizations do not come close to offsetting the results which would become apparent in the general destruction of basic moral values. \n  \nThe National Government perceives in the two Christian confessions the most important factors for the preservation of our Volkstum. It will respect any contracts concluded between these Churches and the Länder. \n  \nTheir rights are not to be infringed upon. But the Government expects and hopes that the task of working on the national and moral regeneration of our Volk taken on by the Government will, in turn, be treated with the same respect. \n  \nIt will face all of the other confessions with objective fairness. However, it cannot tolerate that membership in a certain confession or a certain race could mean being released from general statutory obligations or even constitute a license for committing or tolerating crimes which go unpunished. The Government’s concern lies in an honest coexistence between Church and State; the fight against a materialist Weltanschauung and for a genuine Volksgemeinschaft equally serves both the interests of the German nation and the welfare of our Christian faith. \n  \nOur legal institutions must above all work to preserve this Volksgemeinschaft. The irremovability of the judges on the one hand must ensure a flexibility in their judgments for the welfare of society on the other. \n  \nNot the individual but the Volk as a whole must be the focal point of legislative efforts. In future, high treason and betrayal of the Volk (Landes- und Volksverrat) will be ruthlessly eradicated. The foundations on which the judiciary is based can be none other than the foundations on which the nation is based. Thus may the judiciary always take into consideration the difficult burden of decision carried by those who bear the responsibility for shaping the life of the nation under the harsh dictates of reality. \n  \nGreat are the tasks of the National Government in the sphere of economic life. \n  \nHere all action shall be governed by one law: the Volk does not live for the economy, and the economy does not exist for capital, but capital serves the economy and the economy serves the Volk! In principle, the Government protects the economic interests of the German Volk not by taking the roundabout way through an economic bureaucracy to be organized by the State, but by the utmost promotion of private initiative and a recognition of the rights of property. \n  \nA fair balance must be established between productive intention on the one hand and productive work on the other. The administration should respect the results of ability, industriousness and work by being thrifty. The problem of our public finances is also a problem which is, in no small part, the problem of a thrifty administration. \n  \nThe proposed reform of our tax system must result in a simplification in assessment and thus to a decrease in costs and charges. In principle, the tax mill should be built downstream and not at the source. As a consequence of these measures, the simplification of the administration will certainly result in a decrease in the tax burden. This reform of the tax system which is to be implemented in the Reich and the Länder is not, however, an overnight matter, but one to be contemplated when the time is judged to be right. \n  \nAs a matter of principle, the Government will avoid currency experiments. \n  \nWe are faced above all with two economic tasks of the first order. The salvation of the German peasant must be achieved at all costs. \n  \nThe annihilation of this class in our Volk would bring with it the most severe consequences imaginable. The restoration of the profitability of the agricultural operations may be hard on the consumer. But the fate which would descend upon the entire German Volk should the German peasant perish would stand no comparison with these hardships. Only in connection with the profitability of our agriculture which must be achieved at all costs can the problems of stays of execution or debt relief be solved. Were this to prove unsuccessful, the annihilation of our peasants would inevitably lead not only to the collapse of the German economy per se, but above all to the collapse of the German Volkskörper. \n  \nThe maintenance of its health is, however, the first requirement for the blossoming and flourishing of our industry, German domestic trade, and the German export industry. Without the counterweight of the German peasantry, Communist madness would already have overrun Germany by now and thus conclusively destroyed the German economy. What the entire economy, including our export industry, owes to the healthy common sense of the German peasant cannot be compensated by any kind of sacrifice in terms of business. Thus our greatest attention must be devoted to the further settlement of German land in future. \n  \nFurthermore, it is perfectly clear to the National Government that the removal of the distress in both agricultural and urban economy is contingent upon the integration of the army of unemployed in the process of production. \n  \nThis constitutes the second and most monumental economic task. It can be solved only by a general pacification in implementing sound natural economic principles and all measures necessary, even if, at the time, they cannot expect to enjoy any degree of popularity. The creation of jobs and compulsory labor service are, in this connection, only isolated measures within the scope of the offensive as a whole. \n  \nThe attitude of the National Government toward the Mittelstand is similar to its attitude toward the German peasants. \n  \nIts salvation can only be effected within the scope of general economic policy. The National Government is determined to find a far-reaching solution to this problem. It recognizes its historical task of supporting and promoting the millions of German workers in their struggle for their rights to exist. As Chancellor and National Socialist, I feel allied to them as the former companions of my youth. The increase in the consumer power of these masses will constitute a substantial means of reviving the economy. While maintaining our social legislation, the first step to its reform must be taken. In principle, however, every worker shall be utilized in the service of the public. The stagnation of millions of human working hours is madness and a crime which must inevitably lead to the impoverishment of all. Regardless of which values would have been created by the utilization of our surplus work force, for millions of people who today are going to waste in misery and distress, they could represent essential values of life. The organizational capabilities of our Volk must and will succeed in solving this problem. \n  \nWe know that the geographic position of Germany, with her lack of raw materials, does not fully permit Autarkie for our Reich. It cannot be stressed too often that nothing is further from the Reich Government’s mind than hostility to exporting. We know that we need this connection with the world and that the sale of German goods in the world represents the livelihood of many millions of German Volksgenossen. \n  \nBut we also know the requirements for a sound exchange of services between the peoples of the earth. For years, Germany has been compelled to perform services without receiving counter-services. Consequently, the task of maintaining Germany as an active partner in the exchange of goods is less a question of commercial than of financial policy. As long as we are not accorded any settlement of our foreign debts which is fair and appropriate to our strength, we shall unfortunately be forced to maintain our foreign exchange control policy (Devisenzwangswirtschaft). For this reason, the Reich Government is also obligated to maintain the dam built against the flow of capital across the borders. \n  \nIf the Reich Government allows itself to be guided by these principles, one can surely expect the growing understanding of the foreign countries to ease the integration of our Reich in the peaceful competition of the nations. \n  \nThe first step toward promoting transportation with the aim of achieving a reasonable balance of all transportation interests-a reform of the motor vehicle tax-will take place at the beginning of next month. The maintenance of the Reichsbahn and its reintegration under Reich authority, which is to be effected as quickly as possible, is a task which commits us not only in an economic, but also in a moral sense. The National Government will give every encouragement to the development of aviation as a means of peacefully connecting the peoples to one another. \n  \nFor all this activity, the Government requires the support not only of the general powers in our Volk, which it is determined to utilize to the furthest possible extent, but also the devoted loyalty and work of its professional civil service. Only if the public finances are in urgent need will interferences take place; however, even in such a case, strict fairness shall have the highest priority in governing our actions. \n  \nThe protection of the frontiers of the Reich, and with them the life of our Volk and the existence of our economy, is now in the hands of our Reichswehr which, in accordance with the terms imposed upon us by the Treaty of Versailles, can be regarded as the only really disarmed force in the world. In spite of its small size prescribed therein and its totally insufficient arms, the German Volk can regard its Reichswehr with proud satisfaction. This slight instrument of our national self-defense came into existence under the most difficult conditions. In its spirit, it is the bearer of our best military traditions. With painstaking conscientiousness the German Volk has thus fulfilled the obligations imposed upon it in the Peace Treaty; what is more, even the replacement of ships in our fleet to which we were authorized at that time has-I may be allowed to say, unfortunately-been carried out only to a small extent. \n  \nFor years Germany has been waiting in vain for the redemption of the promise to disarm given us by the others. It is the sincere desire of the National Government to be able to refrain from increasing the German Army and our weapons insofar as the rest of the world is also finally willing to fulfill its obligation of radically disarming. For Germany wants nothing except equal rights to live and equal freedom. \n  \nHowever, the National Government wishes to cultivate this spirit of a will for freedom in the German Volk. The honor of the nation, the honor of our Army, and the ideal of freedom-all must once more become sacred to the German Volk! The German Volk wishes to live in peace with the world. \n  \nIt is for this very reason that the Reich Government will use every means to definitively eliminate the separation of the peoples on earth into two categories. \n  \nKeeping open this wound leads the one to distrust, the other to hatred, and in the end to a general feeling of insecurity. The National Government is willing to extend a hand in sincere understanding to every people which is determined to once and for all put an absolute end to the tragic past. The distress of the world can only come to an end if the appropriate foundation is created by means of stable political conditions and if the peoples regain confidence in one another. \n  \nTo deal with the economic catastrophe, the following is necessary: 1. an absolutely authoritarian leadership at home to create confidence in the stability of conditions; 2. safeguarding peace on the part of the major nations for a long time to come and thus restoring the confidence of the people in one another; and 3. the final triumph of the principles of common sense in the organization and leadership of the economy as well as a general release from reparations and impossible liabilities for debts and interest. \n  \nWe are unfortunately confronted by the fact that the Geneva Conference, in spite of lengthy negotiations, has not yet reached any practical result. The decision to institute a real disarmament measure has repeatedly been delayed by questions on technical detail and by the introduction of problems which have nothing to do with disarmament. This procedure is unsuitable. \nThe illegal state of unilateral disarmament and the resulting national insecurity of Germany cannot last any longer. \n  \nWe recognize it as a sign of responsibility and good will that the British Government has, with its disarmament proposal, attempted to finally move the Conference to arrive at speedy decisions. The Reich Government will support any efforts aimed at effectively implementing general disarmament and securing Germany’s long-overdue claim for disarmament. We have been disarmed for fourteen years, and for the past fourteen months we have been waiting for the outcome of the Disarmament Conference. Even more far-reaching is the plan of the head of the Italian Government, who is making a generous and foresighted attempt to ensure the smooth and consistent development of European politics as a whole. We attach the most earnest significance to this plan; we are willing to cooperate with absolute sincerity on the basis it provides in order to unite the four great powers, England, France, Italy, and Germany, in peaceful cooperation to courageously and determinedly approach those tasks upon the solution of which Europe’s fate depends. \n  \nFor this reason we feel particularly grateful for the appreciative warmth which has greeted Germany’s national uprising in Italy. We wish and hope that the concurrence of spiritual ideals will be the basis for a continuing consolidation of the friendly relations between the two countries. \n  \nSimilarly, the Reich Government, which regards Christianity as the unshakable foundation of the ethics and morality of the Volk, places great value on friendly relations with the Vatican and attempts to develop them. We are filled with a feeling of empathy for the troubles and distress of our Brudervolk in Austria. In all its doings, the Reich Government is conscious of the connection between the fate of all German tribes. The attitude toward the other individual foreign powers is evident from what has already been said. But there as well, where the mutual relations are already encumbered with difficulties, we shall endeavor to reach a settlement. However, the differentiation between victor and vanquished can never be the basis of an understanding. \n  \nWe are nonetheless of the conviction that a settlement of this sort in our relations to France is possible if both governments really attack the problems confronting them with farsightedness. In regard to the Soviet Union, the Reich Government is determined to cultivate friendly relations which are productive for both parties. The Government of the National Revolution above all views itself capable of such a positive policy with regard to Soviet Russia. The fight against Communism in Germany is an internal affair, in which we will never tolerate outside interference. The national political relations to other powers to which we are related by mutual interests will not be affected by this. Our relationship with the other countries shall continue to warrant our most earnest attention in future, in particular our relationship to the major countries overseas, with which Germany has long been allied by friendly ties and economic interests. \n  \nWe have particularly at heart the fate of the Germans living outside the borders of the Reich who are allied to us by language, culture, and traditions and who fight hard to retain these values. The National Government is resolved to use all the means at its command to support the rights internationally guaranteed to the German minorities. \n  \nWe welcome the plan of the World Economic Conference and approve of its meeting soon. The Reich Government is willing to contribute to this Conference in order to finally achieve positive results. \n  \nThe most important question is the problem of our short-term and longterm indebtedness abroad. \n  \nThe complete change in the conditions of the commodity markets of the world requires an adaptation. Only by means of trusting cooperation is it possible to really remove the widespread problems. Ten years of honest peace will be more beneficial for the welfare of all nations than thirty years of drawnout stagnation in the terms of victor and vanquished. \n  \nIn order to place itself in a position to fulfill the tasks falling within this scope, the Government has had the two major parties, the National Socialists and the German Nationalists, introduce the Enabling Act in the Reichstag. \n  \nSome of the planned measures require the approval of the majority necessary for constitutional amendments. The performance of these tasks and their completion is necessary. It would be inconsistent with the aim of the national uprising and it would fail to suffice for the intended goal were the Government to negotiate with and request the approval of the Reichstag for its measures in each given case. In this context, the Government is not motivated by a desire to give up the Reichstag as such. On the contrary: it reserves the right, for the future as well, to inform the Reichstag of its measures or to obtain its consent. \n  \nThe authority and the fulfillment of the tasks would suffer, however, were doubts in the stability of the new regime to arise in the Volk. The Reich Government views a further session of the Reichstag as an impossibility under the present condition of a far-reaching state of excitation in the nation. Rarely has the course of a revolution of such great magnitude run in such a disciplined and unbloody manner as the Erhebung of the German Volk during these past weeks. It is my will and my firm intention to provide for this smooth development in future as well. \n  \nHowever, this makes it all the more necessary that the National Government be accorded that position of sovereignty which is fitting, in such an age, to put a halt to developments of a different sort. The Government will only make use of this authorization insofar as this is requisite for the implementation of vital measures. The existence of neither the Reichstag nor the Reichsrat is endangered. The position and the rights of the Reich President remain inviolate. \n  \nIt will always be the first and foremost task of the Government to bring about inner consensus with his aims. The existence of the Länder will not be abolished. \n  \nThe rights of the Churches will not be curtailed and their position vis-à-vis the State will not be altered. The number of cases in which there is an internal necessity for taking refuge in such a law is, in and of itself, limited. All the more, however, the Government insists upon the passage of the bill. Either way, it is asking for a clear decision. It is offering the parties of the Reichstag the chance for a smooth development which might lead to the growth of an understanding in future. However, the Government is just as determined as it is prepared to accept a notice of rejection and thus a declaration of resistance. May you, Gentlemen, now choose for yourselves between peace or war!",

      "text": "As the story goes, the ancient Egyptian God Anubis was born from the womb of Isis when she sacrificed her son Osiris. In doing so, she gave him his immortality. This event became a symbol for the rebirth of a new beginning. It marked the point where the past becomes the present and the future. As such, many cultures around the world revere the god. Some see him as a guardian of tombs, while others view him as an advisor to pharaohs and kings throughout Egypt during the dynastic period. In reality he is just a man. A man from another time.  Tesla, Marconi, Einstein, and the Elijah Thril Machine all culminated in the story of one man.  Displaced in time.  And this time...was not our time.  The year? Well we don't know exactly because the only record left us are the notes and diagrams of the original inventor.  What we do have, though, were the records found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun. These papers contained the secrets of how to make an exobiotic machine.\nThe word \"exo\" means outside or beyond, whereas \"biotics,\" meaning life, describes what happens within living organisms—the biosphere. When you combine them together, you get the term exobiological, referring to any biological entity that exists in outer space. But there must be something more to the equation than meets the eye. Something far greater. For instance, did they really find evidence of alien beings inside of the walls of King Tutankhamun's burial chamber back in 1922?\nWhat if the Egyptians weren't alone after all?  Could it be possible their civilization wasn't destroyed as ours will soon become, instead they went underground and moved on to the next phase of existence?  \nDr. Jules Dufour, a scientist working under the French government's research facility called L'Institut Français de Recherche pour l'Explication des Phénomènes Nuclés (IFREPN), had been searching through old documents stored deep beneath Paris, France. While looking over some of the files, he stumbled across several pages detailing experiments conducted by Nikola Tesla between 1899-1903. His name seemed familiar to him. Then again, everyone knew about him even if they didn't realize it. After all, Tesla invented alternating current electricity, which allowed power plants to produce large amounts of energy. However, Tesla also made other discoveries along the way, including the induction motor and radio transmission. Unfortunately, these accomplishments never reached widespread popularity. Instead, Tesla disappeared into obscurity until his death in 1943. Or did he die then? \nExoBacter Papers - Declaration One. The Rite of Blood Harvest\nIt is our right as citizens of the world to harvest. \nIt is our right as earthbound peoples of every bloodline to maintain our heritage. \nIt is our right to explore the domains of time for our benefit. \nThis paper shall serve as a declaration of my intent and purpose regarding the rite of harvesting. I am Dr. Guglielmo Marconi, born March 3rd, 1890 in Venice, Italy. My family line traces its lineage back hundreds of generations with ties to the Venetian Republic, where we were once free people. We were able to live freely without fear because of the respect and reverence shown toward us by the ruling classes. Our ancestors fought long and hard against the oppression of others so that we might have peace and freedom here on Earth. I was given the opportunity to become an ExoBacter on a winter day in 1889 when the wind blew cold over the Atlantic ocean. I met the future in a moment and was transported to our time 2098. I put my faith in the ExoBacter Council and believe in their vision for our destiny. I have been asked to write out the rites of the harvest for the people. It would be an honor for me to do this. This document serves as a testament to those who come after, as well as myself, to ensure that no one forgets what must be done. With Elijah Thril's Temporal Shift Mechanism the public became time-free. For the first time in history, we have access to the past. ExoBacters believe that we have a right to the minds of history as a kind of eminent domain. In order to preserve ourselves and our culture, it becomes necessary to collect the knowledge contained within the memories of humanity. By collecting human memory, we can better understand the universe around us. To protect the sanctity of the planet, it will be imperative that we control how information flows through the network. Therefore, it behooves us to take advantage of the technology already at hand to keep the flow under tight control. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, to provide the general population of mankind (including you) with a detailed description of the rite of harvesting. Second, to establish the legal framework for governing the harvesting process while ensuring that the system does not fall into disarray. As part of the rite of harvesting, each person participating should submit themselves to a full medical examination to verify identity. Once verified, participants may undergo the following procedure to gain enhanced genetics via the transfer of DNA and neural patterns. After completion of the harvest, all harvested individuals will receive the same genetic make-up as the original donor. However, due to changes in the environment, lifestyle choices, and other factors, the individual will possess different personality traits and abilities than their ancestor. These differences will manifest in subtle ways throughout your life. Your descendants will inherit these unique characteristics. If the recipient chooses, he or she may choose whether to pass along the uniqueness to their children. You cannot change the way that you look or act based on the genetics received during the procedure, but you could potentially experience new senses, skills, and even talents that you never had before. All harvested subjects shall be required to sign a waiver agreeing that the harvesting ceremony and subsequent genetic alteration are irreversible. A copy of the consent form must accompany the application to participate in the harvest.\nThis ritual requires the participation of many generations. We need to gather samples over hundreds if not thousands of years so that we may create the ultimate version of ourselves. Each generation of volunteers needs to be carefully chosen according to the specific requirements of the next step. The selection criteria include age, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical origin, etc. When the proper candidate emerges, the family lineages will be traced back to find a suitable ancestor. Then, using modern techniques such as DNA sequencing, the exact genetic makeup of that ancestor shall be compared against the desired trait. The rite of blood harvest has been declared. \n—From \"The Rites Of Harvest,\" a document written by the Modern Marconi Company\n",

      "text": "Amia Foundation (also known as the American Society for Biotechnology) was founded in 2123 as a private research organization dedicated to developing technology to allow humans to live indefinitely through cloning and gene manipulation. Its first project was to clone Abraham Lincoln after his assassination, followed shortly thereafter by John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Mother Teresa; the last two were both assassinated. The project fell apart when an activist group known as \"Chameleon\" doxed senior Amia staff members and threatened their lives. Ethical dilemmas surrounding the morality of cloning blew through the media like fire. As a result, the foundation went bankrupt. In 2126, the company was purchased by the government under President Andrew Mu and renamed AmiTech. Previous Amia Board Members remained militant against the perceived coup and they publically vowed to continue their work in the shadows. This clandestine group eventually became known as the Amia Foundation, though they had never actually received funding directly from the original board members. Their current goals are unknown but some speculate they seek to resurrect historical figures who died before achieving greatness. Other rumors claim the Amia Foundation wants to build an army of genetically engineered soldiers. Whatever the goal, the Amia Foundation continues to grow in size and influence, despite the best efforts of law enforcement agencies worldwide.\n",

      "text": "Elijah Thril – Intelligence level: 180\nIn the early years of 2092 there existed on Earth a scientist whose brilliance far exceeded Einstein and Newton. But while these men changed human thought forever, this genius left mankind unchanged. Why? Perhaps because he lacked ambition. Or maybe just the will...or courage.... To see beyond his own lifetime, let alone the next generation of humanity upon whom he cast such brilliant eyes. Yet perhaps we all fail ourselves. I know that now. My name: Elias Thril, born July 12th, 2091, and yet my greatest achievement lies ahead, even today! For it is in fact possible to change history, to bend fate's course. With one simple invention. An apparatus that sends a person into the past with no apparent ill effect whatsoever, so much so as to be completely invisible. And once again, what if the future could be changed to make us better than our ancestors, wiser in hindsight, able to correct mistakes before being made?! Yes, you heard me right — a time traveler! A Time Traveler!!\nThis is the tale of how a man named Elijah, working deep inside a military base, discovered an amazing scientific truth.\nI must begin at birth and follow him through life to learn where this story truly began and why the end would prove tragic for everyone concerned. Let your mind wonder as mine did, over those many hours of research in dusty old books and endless internet archives... Who was this young genius child? Where might his destiny lead us, indeed?! Was the boy really destined to become someone great...? What kind of a monster does the future hold in store for the very first time traveler in the annals of science?? Read and judge for yourself!\" - Author's notes included after reading \"A Short Story about Time.\"\nDr Elijah Thril was an ambitious man obsessed with changing everything. When the government decided to invest money into creating a new technology, Thrill knew it would take more funds. That is when the plan came together to raise millions privately to start the project without approval. The rest is still a mystery, but he created his machine within months and disappeared mysteriously shortly afterward. His disappearance led to the creation of the Exobacter Sect, a secretive organization dedicated to finding answers surrounding his death. Their goal became to find the inventor of the temporal transistors and bring them to justice. In order to accomplish this task, they needed to create a team of experts to investigate the matter further. This resulted in the formation of the Exobacter Sect. They were given access to every piece of information regarding Dr. Thrills' work including his personal journal which detailed his experiments and theories. After analyzing the data, the group concluded that the only way to stop the threat posed by the Temporal Transistor was to send a member back in time using the device. However, sending anyone forward or backward in time had been proven impossible due to the paradoxes involved. Thus, the decision was made to use a single individual who was not from the present day. A candidate was selected based on his intelligence, bravery, and willingness to do whatever necessary to save humanity. He was sent back in time to prevent the invention of the TTI and thus avert disaster. Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan and now we are faced with the consequences of our actions...\" - Author's note included after reading \"The Last Days of Humanity\"\n***\nIt all started one night while I was sitting alone in my lab trying to figure out what to write next. As usual, nothing seemed interesting so I turned to the internet to see if there was anything worth writing about. There wasn't much going around except for some boring news articles and a few conspiracy theory sites. Then suddenly something caught my eye! An article titled 'Time Traveler Found Dead.' At first glance, it looked like just another hoax, but upon closer inspection, the details matched up perfectly. It described how a scientist named Isaac Newton died under mysterious circumstances during his trip through time. Now, normally you wouldn't think twice about such a story because it could easily be fake, but then again, maybe it isn't? Maybe someone really did travel back in time and met him before he passed away...\nI immediately began researching the topic and quickly realized that this was probably real. Not only does the name match up with the famous physicist, but the date of his supposed death matches up too. So far everything checked out, but where would I even begin looking for more evidence? That's when I remembered that I had recently purchased a book written by a man claiming to have traveled into the future. Could this be related somehow? If so, perhaps I should read it and try to get inside his head. But wait, shouldn't I at least finish the current chapter first? No, let me check the clock. Oh crap, it's already 2 AM! What am I doing?! My eyes feel heavy and my mind feels foggy.",

After having traveled through two countries, crossing multiple rivers, walking miles upon end, and battling against nature itself, they finally arrived at a small fishing village located near the southern coast of England. The sun was beginning its descent into the ocean, painting everything orange. It cast shadows along the cliffs surrounding the bay. On the beach, the water looked blacker than normal due to the low sunlight reflecting off of it. As if in answer to the sunset, a lone seagull circled above the town square below. Its wings flapped loudly, causing the wind to whip sand across the cobblestone streets. In front of the church stood a large sign reading: 'Welcome to Bournemouth.' Below that, written in chalk, read the words, 'Beware the Devil's Footprints!'. Rupert Macintosh, Hax Lud, and Temple Sexton made their debut on the town in style. Their clothes were new and clean; their faces were freshly shaved and oiled. All three men had taken great pains to appear presentable. This was important because there would likely be some who might recognize them, which could lead to trouble. Not only were these individuals from faraway places, but they also held positions of power. To make matters worse, all three men carried guns—not just any kind either. These weapons were custom-made by none other than the infamous John Moses Browning himself. Each gun bore serial numbers stamped into the barrel and frame, indicating they were among the first manufactured.",

      "text": "The tomb of Tutankhamun, also known by its tomb number, KV62, is the burial place of Tutankhamun (reigned c. 1334–1325 BC), a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb consists of four chambers and an entrance staircase and corridor. It is smaller and less extensively decorated than other Egyptian royal tombs of its time, and it probably originated as a tomb for a non-royal individual that was adapted for Tutankhamun's use after his premature death. Like other pharaohs, Tutankhamun was buried with a wide variety of funerary objects and personal possessions, such as coffins, furniture, clothing and jewellery, though in the unusually limited space these goods had to be densely packed. Robbers entered the tomb twice in the years immediately following the burial, but Tutankhamun's mummy and most of the burial goods remained intact. The tomb's low position, dug into the floor of the valley, allowed its entrance to be hidden by debris deposited by flooding and tomb construction. Thus, unlike other tombs in the valley, it was not stripped of its valuables during the Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070 – 664 BC).\n\nTutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922 by excavators led by Howard Carter. As a result of the quantity and spectacular appearance of the burial goods, the tomb attracted a media frenzy and became the most famous find in the history of Egyptology. The death of Carter's patron, the Earl of Carnarvon, in the midst of the excavation process inspired speculation that the tomb was cursed. The discovery produced only limited evidence about the history of Tutankhamun's reign and the Amarna Period that preceded it, but it provided insight into the material culture of wealthy ancient Egyptians as well as patterns of ancient tomb robbery. Tutankhamun became one of the best-known pharaohs, and some artefacts from his tomb, such as his golden funerary mask, are among the best-known artworks from ancient Egypt.\n\nMost of the tomb's goods were sent to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are now in the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, although Tutankhamun's mummy and sarcophagus are still on display in the tomb. Flooding and heavy tourist traffic have inflicted damage on the tomb since its discovery, and a replica of the burial chamber has been constructed nearby to reduce tourist pressure on the original tomb.\nContents\n\nROBBERIES \nTutankhamun reigned as pharaoh between c. 1334 and 1325 BC, towards the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom.[1][2] He took the throne as a child after the death of Akhenaten (who was probably his father), and the subsequent brief reigns of Neferneferuaten and Smenkhkare. Akhenaten had radically reshaped ancient Egyptian religion by worshipping a single deity, Aten, and rejecting other deities, a shift that began the Amarna Period.[3] One of Tutankhamun's major acts was the restoration of traditional religious practice. His name was changed from Tutankhaten, referring to Akhenaten's deity, to Tutankhamun, honouring Amun, one of the foremost deities of the traditional pantheon. Similarly, his queen's name was changed from Ankhesenpaaten to Ankhesenamun.[4]\n\nShortly after he took power, he commissioned a full-size royal tomb, which was probably one of two tombs from the same era, WV23 or KV57.[5] KV62 is thought to have originally been a non-royal tomb, possibly intended for Ay, Tutankhamun's advisor. After he died prematurely, KV62 was enlarged to accommodate his burial. Ay became pharaoh on Tutankhamun's death and was buried in WV23. Ay was elderly when he came to the throne, and it is possible that he buried Tutankhamun in KV62 in order to usurp WV23 for himself and ensure that he would have a tomb of suitably royal proportions ready when he himself died. Pharaohs in Tutankhamun's time also built mortuary temples where they would receive offerings to sustain their spirits in the afterlife. The Temple of Ay and Horemheb at Medinet Habu contained statues that were originally carved for Tutankhamun, suggesting either that Tutankhamun's temple stood nearby or that Ay usurped Tutankhamun's temple as his own.[6]\n\nAy was succeeded by Tutankhamun's general Horemheb, although the transfer of power may have been contested and created a brief period of political instability.[7][8] As part of the continued reaction against Atenism, Horemheb tried to erase Akhenaten and his successors from the record, dismantling Akhenaten's monuments and usurping those erected by Tutankhamun. Future king-lists skipped straight from Akhenaten's father, Amenhotep III, to Horemheb.[7]\n\nWithin a few years of his burial, the tomb was robbed twice. After the first robbery, officials responsible for its security repaired and repacked some of the damaged goods before filling the outer corridor with chips of limestone, along with objects dropped by the thieves, to deter future thefts. Nevertheless, a second set of robbers burrowed through the corridor fill. This robbery too was detected, and after a second hasty restoration the tomb was once again sealed.[9]\n\nThe Valley of the Kings is subject to periodic flash floods that deposit alluvium.[10] Much of the valley, including the entrance to Tutankhamun's tomb, was covered by a layer of alluvium over which huts were later built for the tomb workers who cut KV57, in which Horemheb was buried. The geologist Stephen Cross has argued that a major flood deposited this layer after KV62 was last sealed and before the huts were built, which would mean Tutankhamun's tomb had been rendered inaccessible by the time Ay's reign ended.[11] However, the Egyptologist Andreas Dorn suggests that this layer already existed during Tutankhamun's reign, and workers dug through it to reach the bedrock into which they cut his tomb.[12]\n\nMore than 150 years after Tutankhamun's burial, KV9, the tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, was cut into the rock to the west of his tomb.[13] The entrance of his tomb was further buried by mounds of debris from KV9's excavation and by huts built by the tomb workers atop that debris. In subsequent years the tombs in the valley suffered major waves of robbery: first during the late Twentieth Dynasty by local gangs of thieves, then during the Twenty-first Dynasty by officials working for the High Priests of Amun, who stripped the tombs of their valuables and removed the royal mummies. Tutankhamun's tomb, buried and forgotten, remained undisturbed.[14] \n\nSeveral tombs in the Valley of the Kings lay open continuously from ancient times onward, but the entrances to many others remained hidden until after the emergence of Egyptology in the early nineteenth century.[15] Many of the remaining tombs were found by a series of excavators working for Theodore M. Davis from 1902 to 1914. Under Davis most of the valley was explored, although he never found Tutankhamun's tomb because he thought no tomb would have been cut into the valley floor.[16] Among his discoveries was KV54, a pit containing objects bearing Tutankhamun's name; these objects are now thought to have been either burial goods that were originally stored in the corridor of Tutankhamun's tomb, which were removed and reburied in KV54 when the restorers filled the corridor, or objects related to Tutankhamun's funeral. Davis's excavators also discovered a small tomb called KV58 that contained pieces of a chariot harness bearing the names of Tutankhamun and Ay. Davis was convinced that KV58 was Tutankhamun's tomb.[17]\nThe northwest corner of the antechamber, as photographed in 1922. The plaster partition between the antechamber and burial chamber is on the right.\n\nAfter Davis gave up work on the valley, the archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, made an effort to clear the valley of debris down to the bedrock. Davis's finds of artefacts bearing Tutankhamun's name gave them reason to hope they might find his tomb.[18] The discovery began on 4 November 1922 with a single step at the top of the entrance staircase.[19] When the excavators reached the antechamber, on 26 November, it exceeded all expectations, providing unprecedented insight into what a New Kingdom royal burial was like.[20]\n\nThe condition of the burial goods varied greatly; many had been profoundly affected by moisture, which probably derived from both the damp state of the plaster when the tomb was first sealed and from water seepage over the millennia until it was excavated.[21] Recording the tomb's contents and conserving them so they could survive to be transported to Cairo proved to be an unprecedented task, lasting for ten digging seasons.[22][23] Although many others participated, the only members of the excavation team who worked throughout the process were Carter; Alfred Lucas, a chemist who was instrumental in the conservation effort; Harry Burton, who photographed the tomb and its artifacts; and four foremen, Ahmed Gerigar, Gad Hassan, Hussein Abu Awad, and Hussein Ahmed Said.[24]\n\nThe spectacular nature of the tomb goods inspired a media frenzy, dubbed \"Tutmania\", that made Tutankhamun into one of the most famous pharaohs, often known by the nickname \"King Tut\".[25][26] In the Western world, the publicity inspired a fad for ancient Egyptian-inspired design motifs.[27] In Egypt, it reinforced the ideology of pharaonism, which emphasized modern Egypt's connection to its ancient past and had risen to prominence during Egypt's struggle for independence from British rule from 1919 to 1922.[28] The publicity increased when Carnarvon died of an infection in April 1923, inspiring rumors that he had been killed by a curse on the tomb. Other deaths or strange events connected with the tomb came to be attributed to the curse as well.[29]\n\nAfter Carnarvon's death, the tomb clearance continued under Carter's leadership. In the second season of the process, in late 1923 and early 1924, the antechamber was emptied of artefacts and work began on the burial chamber.[30] The Egyptian government, which had become partially independent in 1922, fought with Carter over the question of access to the tomb; the government felt that Egyptians, and especially the Egyptian press, were given too little access. In protest of the government's increasing restrictions, Carter and his associates stopped work in February 1924, beginning a legal dispute that lasted until January 1925. Under the agreement that resolved the dispute, the artefacts from the tomb would not be divided between the government and the dig's sponsors, as had been standard practice on previous Egyptological digs.[31] Instead, most of the tomb's contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.[32]\n\nThe excavators opened and removed Tutankhamun's coffins and mummy in 1925, then spent the next few seasons working on the treasury and annex. The clearance of the tomb itself was completed in November 1930. However, Carter and Lucas continued to work on conserving the remaining burial goods until February 1932, when the last shipment was sent to Cairo.\n\nDIMENSIONS AND ARCHITECTURE\nTutankhamun's tomb lies in the eastern branch of the Valley of the Kings, where most tombs in the valley are located.[45] It is cut into the limestone bedrock in the valley floor, on the west side of the main path, and runs beneath a low foothill.[46] Its design is similar to those of non-royal tombs from its time, but elaborated so as to resemble the conventional plan of a royal tomb.[47] It consists of a westward-descending stairway (labeled A in the conventional Egyptological system for designating parts of royal tombs in the valley); an east–west descending corridor (B); an antechamber at the west end of the passage (I); an annexe adjoining the southwest corner of the antechamber (Ia); a burial chamber north of the antechamber (J); and a room east of the burial chamber (Ja), known as the treasury.[48] The burial chamber and treasury may have been added to the original tomb when it was adapted for Tutankhamun's burial.[47] Most Eighteenth Dynasty royal tombs used a layout with a bent axis, so that a person moving from the entrance to the burial chamber would take a sharp turn to the left along the way. By placing Tutankhamun's burial chamber north of the antechamber, the builders of KV62 gave it a layout with an axis bent to the right rather than the left.[49][50]\n\nThe entrance stair descends steeply beneath an overhang.[5] It originally consisted of sixteen steps. The lowest six were cut away during the burial to make room to maneuver the largest pieces of funerary furniture through the doorway, then rebuilt, then removed again 3,400 years later when the excavators removed that same furniture. The corridor is 8 metres (26 ft) long and 1.7 metres (5 ft 7 in) wide; the antechamber is 7.9 metres (26 ft) north–south by 3.6 metres (12 ft) east–west; the annexe is 4.4 metres (14 ft) north–south by 2.6 metres (8 ft 6 in) east–west; the burial chamber is 4 metres (13 ft) north–south by 6.4 metres (21 ft) east–west; and the treasury is 4.8 metres (16 ft) north–south by 3.8 metres (12 ft) east–west. The chambers range from 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in) to 3.6 metres (12 ft) high, and the floors of the annexe, burial chamber and treasury are about 0.9 metres (2 ft 11 in) below the floor of the antechamber. In the west wall of the antechamber is a small niche for a beam that was used for manoeuvring the sarcophagus through the room.[51] The burial chamber contains four niches, one in each wall, in which were placed \"magic bricks\" inscribed with protective spells.[51][52]\n\nPartitions constructed of limestone and plaster originally sealed the doorways between the stairway and the corridor; between the corridor and the antechamber; between the antechamber and the annexe; and between the antechamber and the burial chamber. All were breached by robbers. Most were resealed by the restorers, but the robbers' hole in the annexe doorway was left open.[53]\n\nThere are several faults in the rock into which the tomb is cut, including a large one that runs south-southeast to north-northwest across the antechamber and burial chamber.[54] Although the workmen who cut the tomb sealed the fault in the burial chamber with plaster,[55] the faults are responsible for the water seepage that affects the tomb.[54] \n\nTHE MUMMY\nWhen it was uncovered in November 1925, Tutankhamun's mummy was in poor condition.[128] The unguents that were poured over the wrappings before burial had undergone a chemical reaction that Lucas called \"some kind of slow spontaneous combustion\", possibly caused by fungi in the tomb.[129] As a result most of the wrappings, and even much of the tissues in the mummy, had been carbonised.[130] Tutankhamun's condition contrasted with the much better-preserved mummies of other New Kingdom rulers.[131] These mummies had been removed from their plundered tombs, placed in simpler coffins and buried in two caches during the Twenty-first Dynasty, a few centuries after they were originally entombed.[132] It is not known whether they suffered less deterioration because they were less liberally treated with unguents, or because their removal from their original coffins prevented the unguents from soaking through the wrappings.[130][131]\n\nThe solidified unguents glued together Tutankhamun's remains, his mummy wrappings and the objects on his body, forming a single mass stuck to the bottom of the coffin encasing it. The excavators concluded that to remove the mummy and extricate the burial goods they would have to cut it into sections, chiseling each piece out of its setting. Two anatomists, Douglas Derry and Saleh Bey Hamdi, examined the pieces as they came free before coating the fragile flesh in paraffin wax to prevent further deterioration.[133] They determined that Tutankhamun had been close to the age of 18 when he died, and that his skull shape, closely resembling that of an unidentified royal mummy from KV55, showed he was of royal blood rather than having married into the royal family, as Egyptologists had previously believed.[134][135] When the examination concluded, Carter placed the dismembered mummy on a sand tray, which he returned to the sarcophagus in the burial chamber the following year.[136]\n\nThe mummified fetuses are at different stages of development, one at five months' gestation and the other at seven to nine. Their coffins do not specify names, so they are designated based on the object number of the box that contained them (317); the smaller fetus is known as 317a(2) and the larger as 317b(2).[137] They were examined by Derry in 1932[138] and subsequently stored at the medical school where he worked, now part of Cairo University.[139]\n\nTutankhamun's mummy has often been analysed to see what health conditions he had, and particularly to determine his cause of death. Such efforts are often contentious, as it is difficult to distinguish damage inflicted on the body in recent times from damage Tutankhamun suffered while alive. For instance, in 1996, the Egyptologist Bob Brier suggested that fragments of bone in the skull cavity, seen in the X-rays that Harrison had taken in 1968, were a sign that Tutankhamun had died of a blow to the head and might have been murdered. The bone fragments were later found to be fragments of vertebrae that were pushed into the skull cavity during Derry's examination.[140][141] The fetuses have faced similar problems; Harrison, in 1977, said 317b(2) had Sprengel's deformity, but a study in 2011 by the radiologist Sahar Saleem argued that the signs of deformity were actually postmortem damage.[142]\n\nBoth Tutankhamun's mummy and the fetuses have undergone genetic testing. A 2010 study of the DNA of many of the mummies from the Valley of the Kings announced that the fetuses were Tutankhamun's children by a woman whose mummy was found in KV21, who was presumed to be Ankhesenamun. However, the results of genetic studies of Egyptian mummies have been questioned by several geneticists, such as Svante Pääbo, who argue that DNA breaks down so rapidly in Egypt's heat that remains more than a few centuries old cannot produce an analysable DNA sample.[143] ",

      "text": " Discovered tomb under tomb of Ramses VI\nInvestigated same & found seals intact. \nIt took the whole of the preceding day and most of this day to free this excavation before the upper margins of the staircase could be demarcated on its four sides. As first conjectured it proved to be an opening (about 4 ms x 1.60 ms) excavated in the bed-rock, with its W. end abutting against the rock slope of the small hillock in which Ramses VI had excavated his tomb. As the work proceeded we found that the western end of the cutting receded under the slope of the rock, and thus was partly roofed over by the overhanging rock. \nTowards sunset we had cleared down to the level of the 12th step, which was sufficient to expose a large part of the upper portion of a plastered and sealed doorway. Here before us was sufficient evidence to show that it really was an entrance to a tomb, and by the seals, to all outward appearances that it was intact. \nI examined this exposed portion of the sealed doorway and noticed that the only decipherable impressions of the seals were those of the well-known Royal Necropolis seal, i.e., Anubis (symbolizing a king) over nine foes. \nWith the evidence of these seals, and the fact that the workmen's huts, which in all probabilities dated from the time of the construction of Rameses VI's tomb, were built over the mouth of the entrance of this newly discovered tomb without apparently disturbing it, it was clear that its content would be undisturbed at least since the XXth Dyn. \nThe seal-impressions suggested that it belonged to somebody of high standing but at that time I had not found any indications as to whom. \nI noticed at the top of the doorway, where some of the cement-like plaster had fallen away, a heavy wooden lintel. To assure myself of the method in which the doorway was blocked, I made a small hole under this wooden lintel - the R. hand corner, about 35 x 15 cms in size. By this hole I was able to perceive with the aid of an electrical torch that a passage beyond was completely filled with stones and rubble up to its ceiling, which was again evidence of something that had required careful closing. It was a thrilling moment for an excavator, quite alone save his native staff of workmen, to suddenly find himself, after so many years of toilsome work, on the verge of what looked like a magnificent discovery - an untouched tomb. With certain reluctance I reclosed the small hole that I had made, and returned to another careful search among the seals to see if I could not find some indication that would point to the identity of the owner, but it was of no avail for the small space bared by my excavation did not expose any impression sufficiently clear to be made out, other than that of the Royal Necropolis seal already mentioned. \nThough I was satisfied that I was on the verge of perhaps a magnificent find, probably one of the missing tombs that I had been seeking for many years, I was much puzzled by the smallness of the opening in comparison with those of other royal tombs in the valley. Its design was certainly of the XVIIIth Dyn. Could it be the tomb of a noble, buried there by royal consent? Or was it a royal cache? As far as my investigations had gone there was absolutely nothing to tell me. Had I known that by digging a few inches deeper I would have exposed seal impressions showing Tut.ankh.Amen's insignia distinctly I would have fervently worked on and set my mind at rest, but as it was, it was getting late, the night had fast set in, the full moon had risen high in the eastern heavens, I refilled the excavation for protection, and with my men selected for the occasion - they like myself delighted beyond all expectation - I returned home and cabled to Ld. C. (then in England) the following message:- \n\"At last have made wonderful discovery in Valley a magnificent tomb with seals intact recovered same for your arrival congratulations \"",

      "text": "Howard Carter was an archeologist. In 1907, he began work for Lord Carnarvon, who employed him to supervise the excavation of nobles' tombs in Deir el-Bahri, near Thebes.[11] Gaston Maspero, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, had recommended Carter to Carnarvon as he knew he would apply modern archaeological methods and systems of recording.[12] Carter soon developed a good working relationship with his patron, with Lady Burghclere, Carnarvon's sister, observing that \"for the next sixteen years the two men worked together with varying fortune, yet ever united not more by their common aim than by their mutual regard and affection\".[13]\nKV62 in the Valley of the Kings\n\nIn 1914, Lord Carnarvon received the concession to dig in the Valley of the Kings.[14] Carter led the work, undertaking a systematic search for any tombs missed by previous expeditions, in particular that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. However, excavations were soon interrupted by the First World War, Carter spending the war years working for the British Government as a diplomatic courier and translator. He enthusiastically resumed his excavation work towards the end of 1917.[14]\n\nBy 1922, Lord Carnarvon had become dissatisfied with the lack of results after several years of finding little. After considering withdrawing his funding, Carnarvon agreed, after a discussion with Carter, that he would fund one more season of work in the Valley of the Kings.[15]\n\nCarter returned to the Valley of Kings, and investigated a line of huts that he had abandoned a few seasons earlier. The crew cleared the huts and rock debris beneath. On 4 November 1922, their young water boy accidentally stumbled on a stone that turned out to be the top of a flight of steps cut into the bedrock.[16] Carter had the steps partially dug out until the top of a mud-plastered doorway was found. The doorway was stamped with indistinct cartouches (oval seals with hieroglyphic writing). Carter ordered the staircase to be refilled and sent a telegram to Carnarvon, who arrived from England two-and-a-half weeks later on 23 November, accompanied by his daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert.\n\nOn 24 November 1922, the full extent of the stairway was cleared, and a seal containing Tutankhamun's cartouche was found on the outer doorway. This door was removed, and the rubble-filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door of the tomb itself.[18] On 26 November, Carter, with Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn, and assistant Arthur Callender in attendance, made a \"tiny breach in the top left-hand corner\" of the doorway, using a chisel that his grandmother had given him for his 17th birthday. He was able to peer in by the light of a candle and see that many of the gold and ebony treasures were still in place. He did not yet know whether it was \"a tomb or merely an old cache\", but he did see a promising sealed doorway between two sentinel statues. Carnarvon asked, \"Can you see anything?\" Carter replied: \"Yes, wonderful things!\"[19] Carter had, in fact, discovered Tutankhamun's tomb (subsequently designated KV62).[20] The tomb was then secured, to be entered in the presence of an official of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities the next day.[21] However that night, Carter, Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and Callender apparently made an unauthorised visit, becoming the first people in modern times to enter the tomb.[22][23][24] Some sources suggest that the group also entered the inner burial chamber.[25] In this account, a small hole was found in the chamber's sealed doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through.[24]\n\nThe next morning, 27 November, saw an inspection of the tomb in the presence of an Egyptian official. Callender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a vast haul of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones, and shrines. They also saw evidence of two further chambers, including the sealed doorway to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun.[26] In spite of evidence of break-ins in ancient times, the tomb was virtually intact, and would ultimately be found to contain over 5,000 items.\n\nOn 29 November the tomb was officially opened in the presence of a number of invited dignitaries and Egyptian officials.[27]\nCarter's house in the Theban Necropolis, in 2009\n\nRealising the size and scope of the task ahead, Carter sought help from Albert Lythgoe of the Metropolitan Museum's excavation team, working nearby, who readily agreed to lend a number of his staff, including Arthur Mace and archaeological photographer Harry Burton,[28] while the Egyptian government loaned analytical chemist Alfred Lucas.[29] The next several months were spent cataloguing and conserving the contents of the antechamber under the \"often stressful\" supervision of Pierre Lacau, director general of the Department of Antiquities.[30] On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway and confirmed it led to a burial chamber, containing the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun. The tomb was considered the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings, and the discovery was eagerly covered by the world's press. However, much to the annoyance of other newspapers, Lord Carnarvon sold exclusive reporting rights to The Times. Only Arthur Merton of that paper was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to establish Carter's reputation with the British public.[31]\n\nTowards the end of February 1923, a rift between Lord Carnarvon and Carter, probably caused by a disagreement on how to manage the supervising Egyptian authorities, temporarily halted the excavation. Work recommenced in early March after Lord Carnarvon apologised to Carter.[32] Later that month Lord Carnarvon contracted blood poisoning while staying in Luxor near the tomb site. He died in Cairo on 5 April 1923.[33] Lady Carnarvon retained her late husband's concession in the Valley of the Kings, allowing Carter to continue his work.\n\nCarter's meticulous assessing and cataloguing of the thousands of objects in the tomb took nearly ten years, most being moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. There were several breaks in the work, including one lasting nearly a year in 1924–25, caused by a dispute over what Carter saw as excessive control of the excavation by the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The Egyptian authorities eventually agreed that Carter should complete the tomb's clearance.[34] This continued until 1929, with some final work lasting until February 1932.[35]\n\nDespite the significance of his archaeological find, Carter received no honour from the British government. However, in 1926, he received the Order of the Nile, third class, from King Fuad I of Egypt.[36] He was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Yale University and honorary membership in the Real Academia de la Historia of Madrid, Spain.[37]\n\nCarter wrote a number of books on Egyptology during his career,[38] including Five Years' Exploration at Thebes, co-written with Lord Carnarvon in 1912, describing their early excavations,[39] and a three-volume popular account of the discovery and excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb.[40] He also delivered a series of illustrated lectures on the excavation, including a 1924 tour of Britain, France, Spain and the United States.[41] Those in New York and other US cities were attended by large and enthusiastic audiences, sparking American Egyptomania,[42] with President Coolidge requesting a private lecture.[43]\n\nIn 2022, a 1934 letter to Carter from Alan Gardiner came to light, accusing him of stealing from Tutankhamun's tomb. Carter had given Gardiner an amulet and assured him it had not come from the tomb, but Reginald Engelbach, director of the Egyptian Museum, later confirmed its match with other samples originating in the tomb. Egyptologist Bob Brier said the letter proved previous rumours, and the contemporary suspicions of Egyptian authorities, that Carter had been siphoning treasures for himself.[44] ",

      "text": "Title: The Time Machine\nAuthor: H. G. Wells\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\n“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.”\n\n“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.\n\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.”\n\n“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All real things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?”\n\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.\n\n“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?”\n\nFilby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”\n\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. “Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?”\n\n“I have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?”\n\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\n\n“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”\n\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\n\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.\n\n“Easier, far easier down than up.”\n\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.”\n\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.”\n\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\n\n“Oh, this,” began Filby, “is all—”\n\n“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It’s against reason,” said Filby.\n\n“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will never convince me.”\n\n“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.”\n\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\n\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man. “Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\n\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the Very Young Man thought.\n\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.”\n\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!”\n\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic basis.”\n\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.\n\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\n\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify that?”\n\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s all humbug, you know.”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.\n\nThe Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\n\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s anecdote collapsed.\nII.\nThe Machine\n\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.\n\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?” said the Psychologist.\n\n“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one little white lever, and here is another.”\n\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. “It’s beautifully made,” he said.\n\n“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a quack.”\n\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe.\n\nWe stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.”\n\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said Filby.\n\n“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\n\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.\n\n“Why?” said the Time Traveller.\n\n“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time.”\n\n“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”\n\n“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\n\n“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You think. You can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.”\n\n“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You see?” he said, laughing.\n\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\n\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\n\n“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”\n\n“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, “I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.”\n\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\n\nI caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at me solemnly.\nIII.\nThe Time Traveller Returns\n\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown him far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\n\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s half-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have dinner?”\n\n“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.\n\n“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says he’ll explain when he comes.”\n\n“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\n\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\n\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\n\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught. “That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\n\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”\n\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.\n\n“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.\n\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. “What was this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?” And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.\n\n“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”\n\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”\n\n“Story!” cried the Editor.\n\n“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.”\n\n“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\n\n“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\n\n“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\n\n“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.\n\n“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?”\n\n“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s face.\nIV.\nTime Travelling\n>\n\n“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\n\n“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\n“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\n\n“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\n\n“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of stopping.\n\n“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air.\n\n“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you.’\n\n“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n\n“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.\n\n“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently slain.\n\n“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.\n\n“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\n\n“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.\n\n“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from the machine.\nV.\nIn the Golden Age\n\n“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\n“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.\n\n“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\n\n“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.\n\n“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time Machine in vain.\n\n“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind.\n\n“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.\n\n“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\n\n“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange.\n\n“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure.\n\n“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong, silky material.\n\n“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their import.\n\n“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’ But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued.\nVI.\nThe Sunset of Mankind\n\n“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop examining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own devices.\n\n“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.\n\n“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in its proper place.\n\n“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared.\n\n“‘Communism,’ said I to myself.\n\n“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.\n\n“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\n\n“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\n“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise, corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\n\n“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\n\n“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more secure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\n“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.\n\n“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had leapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\n\n“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\n\n“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. Now, where are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.\n\n“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\n“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be hindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.\n\n“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\n\n“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible enough—as most wrong theories are!\nVII.\nA Sudden Shock\n\n“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could sleep.\n\n“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly to myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’\n\n“But it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\n\n“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world.\n\n“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.\n\n“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\n\n“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\n\n“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my Time Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten.\n\n“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n\n“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself. ‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n\n“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine. There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n\n“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n\n“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels. I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is another matter.\n\n“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels, and if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\n\n“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\nVIII.\nExplanation\n\n“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight.\n\n“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\n\n“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I can convey very little of the difference to your mind.\n\n“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none.\n\n“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things were kept going.\n\n“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!\n\n“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.\n\n“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!\n\n“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\n\n“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes.\n\n“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\n\n“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted my eyes.\n\n“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere creatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I wonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\n\n“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it.\n\n“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\n\n“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\n\n“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared.\n\n“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages.\n\n“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\n\n“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\n\n“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\n\n“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact, except along the river valley—showed how universal were its ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth.\n\n“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the end—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth?\n\n“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.\n\n“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the beautiful race that I already knew.\n\n“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.\nIX.\nThe Morlocks\n\n“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.\n\n“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among them—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\n“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium.\n\n“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\n\n“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared.\n\n“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.\n\n“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\n\n“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it now,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\n\n“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\n\n“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I missed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me.\n\n“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\n\n“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\n\n“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\nX.\nWhen Night Came\n\n“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\n\n“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.\n\n“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me.\n\n“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.\n\n“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”\n\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\n\n“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine?\n\n“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue—a Faun, or some such figure, minus the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.\n\n“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were very sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.\n\n“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\n\n“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\n\n“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.\n\n“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side!\n\n“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear.\n\n“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\nXI.\nThe Palace of Green Porcelain\n\n“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I never followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things in the sea.\n\n“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\n\n“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.\n\n“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me.\n\n“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my mind.\n\n“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\n\n“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well.\n\n“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.\n\n“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.\n\n“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know.\n\n“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\n“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy.\n\n“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\n\n“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work.\nXII.\nIn the Darkness\n\n“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\n\n“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat.\n\n“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena.\n\n“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n\n“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still.\n\n“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!\n\n“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In manœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes shone like carbuncles.\n\n“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n\n“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free.\n\n“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight.\n\n“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!\n\n“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more of them.\n\n“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.\n\n“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.\n\n“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.\n\n“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain.\n\n“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\nXIII.\nThe Trap of the White Sphinx\n\n“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And their end was the same.\n\n“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\n\n“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\n\n“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you.\n\n“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep.\n\n“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\n\n“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves.\n\n“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\n“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it.\n\n“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.\n\n“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\n\n“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box.\n\n“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.\n\n“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described.\nXIV.\nThe Further Vision\n\n“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch—into futurity.\n\n“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible.\n\n“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight.\n\n“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.\n\n“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.\n\n“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\n\n“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\n\n“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate, watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\n\n“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little.\n\n“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth.\n\n“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\n\n“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\nXV.\nThe Time Traveller’s Return\n\n“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism down.\n\n“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a flash.\n\n“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and the whole thing have been a dream.\n\n“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\n\n“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.\nXVI.\nAfter the Story\n\n“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man. “No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”\n\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, were motionless.\n\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer of stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s shoulder.\n\n“You don’t believe it?”\n\n“Well——”\n\n“I thought not.”\n\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I hardly believe it myself..... And yet...”\n\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.\n\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The gynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see, holding out his hand for a specimen.\n\n“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How shall we get home?”\n\n“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist.\n\n“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”\n\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”\n\n“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man.\n\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room. “I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I must look at that machine. If there is one!”\n\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.” He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room.\n\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\n\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in there.”\n\n“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”\n\n“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,” he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my leaving you now?”\n\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Time Traveller.\n\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\n\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.\n\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out that way?” said I.\n\n“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him here.”\n\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned.\nEpilogue\n\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man.\n",

      "text": "WELLS, HERBERT GEORGE (1866–⁠), an English novelist was born at Bromley, Kent, on the 21st of September, 1866, the son of Joseph Wells, a professional cricketer. He was educated at Midhurst grammar school and at the Royal College of Science, where he was trained in physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology and biology. He graduated B.Sc. of London University in 1888 with first-class honours, taught science in a private school, and subsequently did private coaching. In 1893 he began to write for the Pall Mall Gazette, of which he was dramatic critic in 1895. He also wrote for Nature and the Saturday Review. After the success of his fantastic story The Time Machine (1895) he gave his time chiefly to the writing of romances, in which the newest scientific and technological discoveries were used to advance his views on politics and sociology. But he did not confine himself to fiction. His Anticipations (1902) showed his real gift for sociological speculation. Beginning with a chapter on the means of locomotion in the 20th century, it went on to discuss war, the conflict of languages, faith, morals, the elimination of the unfit, and other general topics, with remarkable acuteness and constructive ability. In The Discovery of the Future (1902), Mankind in the Making (1903), A Modern Utopia (1905) and New Worlds for Old (1908) his socialistic theories were further developed. As a novelist, meanwhile, he had taken a very high place. Some earlier stories, such as the Wheels of Chance (1896) and Love and Mr Lewisham (1900), had proved his talent for drawing character, and pure phantasies like The War of the Worlds (1898) his abundant invention; but Kipps (1905) and Tono-Bungay (1909) showed a great advance in artistic power. The list of his works of fiction includes The Stolen Bacillus and other Stories (1895), The Wonderful Visit (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Plattner Story and Others (1897), When the Sleeper Wakes (1899), The First Men in the Moon (1901), The Food of the Gods (1904), In the Days of the Comet (1906), The War in the Air (1908), Anne Veronica (1909), The History of Mr Polly (1910).\n\nstranger than,new adventures,carleton university,twentieth century,charles dickens,maybury road,free h.,right size,paul pender,north carolina,félix j. palma,illinois ebooks,world

      "text": "Tutankhamun (, Ancient Egyptian: twt-ꜥnḫ-jmn), Egyptological pronunciation Tutankhamen () (c. 1341 – c. 1323 BC), commonly referred to as King Tut, was an Egyptian pharaoh who was the last of his royal family to rule during the end of the 18th Dynasty (ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC in the conventional chronology) during the New Kingdom of Egyptian history. His father is believed to be the pharaoh Akhenaten, identified as the mummy found in the tomb KV55. His mother is his father's sister, identified through DNA testing as an unknown mummy referred to as \"The Younger Lady\" who was found in KV35.Tutankhamun took the throne at eight or nine years of age under the unprecedented viziership of his eventual successor, Ay, to whom he may have been related. He married his paternal half-sister Ankhesenamun. During their marriage they lost two daughters, one at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other shortly after birth at full-term. His names—Tutankhaten and Tutankhamun—are thought to mean \"Living image of Aten\" and \"Living image of Amun\", with Aten replaced by Amun after Akhenaten's death. A small number of Egyptologists, including Battiscombe Gunn, believe the translation may be incorrect and closer to \"The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing\" or, as Professor Gerhard Fecht believes, reads as \"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\".\nTutankhamun restored the Ancient Egyptian religion after its dissolution by his father, enriched and endowed the priestly orders of two important cults and began restoring old monuments damaged during the previous Amarna period. He reburied his father's remains in the Valley of the Kings and relocated the capital from Akhetaten back to Thebes. Tutankhamun was physically disabled with a deformity of his left foot along with bone necrosis that required the use of a cane, several of which were found in his tomb. He had other health issues including scoliosis and had contracted several strains of malaria.\nThe 1922 discovery by Howard Carter of Tutankhamun's nearly intact tomb, in excavations funded by Lord Carnarvon, received worldwide press coverage. With over 5,000 artifacts, it sparked a renewed public interest in ancient Egypt, for which Tutankhamun's mask, now in the Egyptian Museum, remains a popular symbol. The deaths of a few involved in the discovery of Tutankhamun's mummy have been popularly attributed to the curse of the pharaohs. Some of his treasure has traveled worldwide with unprecedented response; the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities allowed tours beginning in 1961. He has, since the discovery of his intact tomb, been referred to colloquially as \"King Tut\".\n\n== Family ==\nTutankhamun, whose original name was Tutankhaten or Tutankhuaten, was born during the reign of Akhenaten, during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Akhenaten's reign was characterized by a dramatic shift in ancient Egyptian religion, known as Atenism, and the relocation of the capital to the site of Amarna, which gave its name to the modern term for this era, the Amarna Period. Toward the end of the Amarna Period, two other pharaohs appear in the record who were apparently Akhenaten's co-regents: Neferneferuaten, a female ruler who may have been Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti or his daughter Meritaten; and Smenkhkare, whom some Egyptologists believe was the same person as Neferneferuaten but most regard as a distinct figure. It is uncertain whether Smenkhkare's reign outlasted Akhenaten's, whereas Neferneferuaten is now thought to have become co-regent shortly before Akhenaten's death and to have reigned for some time after it.An inscription from Hermopolis refers to \"Tutankhuaten\" as a \"king's son\", and he is generally thought to have been the son of Akhenaten, although some suggest instead that Smenkhkare was his father. Inscriptions from Tutankhamun's reign treat him as a son of Akhenaten's father, Amenhotep III, but that is only possible if Akhenaten's 17-year reign included a long co-regency with his father, a possibility that many Egyptologists once supported but is now being abandoned.While some suggestions have been made that Tutankhamun's mother was Meketaten, the second daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, based on a relief from the Royal Tomb at Amarna, this possibility has been deemed unlikely given that she was about 10 years old at the time of her death. Another interpretation of the relief names Nefertiti as his mother. Meritaten has also been put forward as his mother based on a re-examination of a box lid and coronation tunic found in his tomb. Tutankhamun was wet nursed by a woman named Maia, known from her tomb at Saqqara.In 2008, genetic analysis was carried out on the mummified remains of Tutankhamun and others thought or known to be New Kingdom royalty by a team from University of Cairo. The results indicated that his father was the mummy from tomb KV55, identified as Akhenaten, and that his mother was the mummy from tomb KV35, known as the \"Younger Lady\", who was found to be a full sister of her husband. The team reported it was over 99.99 percent certain that Amenhotep III was the father of the individual in KV55, who was in turn the father of Tutankhamun. More recent genetic analysis, published in 2020, revealed Tutankhamun had the haplogroups YDNA R1b and mtDNA K, both of which originated in the Near East. He shares this Y-haplogroup with his father, the KV55 mummy (Akhenaten), and grandfather, Amenhotep III, and his mtDNA haplogroup with his mother, The Younger Lady, his grandmother, Tiye, and his great-grandmother, Thuya, upholding the results of the earlier genetic study. The profiles for Tutankhamun and Amenhotep III were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results. Because the relationships of these two mummies with the KV55 mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study, the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the KV55 data. The identity of The Younger Lady is unknown but she cannot be Nefertiti, as she was not known to be a sister of Akhenaten. However, researchers such as Marc Gabolde and Aidan Dodson claim that Nefertiti was indeed Tutankhamun's mother. In this interpretation of the DNA results, the genetic closeness is not due to a brother-sister pairing but the result of three generations of first-cousin marriage, making Nefertiti a first cousin of Akhenaten. The validity and reliability of the genetic data from mummified remains has been questioned due to possible degradation due to decay.When Tutankhaten became king, he married Ankhesenpaaten, one of Akhenaten's daughters, who later changed her name to Ankhesenamun. They had two daughters, neither of whom survived infancy. While only an incomplete genetic profile was obtained from the two mummified foetuses, it was enough to confirm that Tutankhamun was their father. Likewise, only partial data for the two female mummies from KV21 has been obtained so far. KV21A has been suggested as the mother of the foetuses but the data is not statistically significant enough to allow her to be securely identified as Ankhesenamun. Computed tomography studies published in 2011 revealed that one daughter was born prematurely at 5–6 months of pregnancy and the other at full-term, 9 months. Tutankhamun's death marked the end of the royal line of the 18th Dynasty.\n\n== Reign ==\nTutankhamun was between eight and nine years of age when he ascended the throne and became pharaoh, taking the throne name Nebkheperure. He reigned for about nine years. During Tutankhamun's reign the position of Vizier had been split between Upper and Lower Egypt. The principal vizier for Upper Egypt was Usermontu. Another figure named Pentju was also vizier but it is unclear of which lands. It is not entirely known if Ay, Tutankhamun's successor, actually held this position. A gold foil fragment from KV58 seems to indicate, but not certainly, that Ay was referred to as a Priest of Maat along with an epithet of \"vizier, doer of maat.\" The epithet does not fit the usual description used by the regular vizier but might indicate an informal title. It might be that Ay used the title of vizier in an unprecedented manner.An Egyptian priest named Manetho wrote a comprehensive history of ancient Egypt where he refers to a king named Orus, who ruled for 36 years and had a daughter named Acencheres who reigned twelve years and her brother Rathotis who ruled for only nine years. The Amarna rulers are central in the list but which name corresponds with which historic figure is not agreed upon by researchers. Orus and Acencheres have been identified with Horemheb and Akhenaten and Rathotis with Tutankhamun. The names are also associated with Smenkhkare, Amenhotep III, Ay and the others in differing order.Kings were venerated after their deaths through mortuary cults and associated temples. Tutankhamun was one of the few kings worshiped in this manner during his lifetime. A stela discovered at Karnak and dedicated to Amun-Ra and Tutankhamun indicates that the king could be appealed to in his deified state for forgiveness and to free the petitioner from an ailment caused by sin. Temples of his cult were built as far away as in Kawa and Faras in Nubia. The title of the sister of the Viceroy of Kush included a reference to the deified king, indicative of the universality of his cult.In order for the pharaoh, who held divine office, to be linked to the people and the gods, special epithets were created for them at their accession to the throne. The ancient Egyptian titulary also served to demonstrate one's qualities and link them to the terrestrial realm. The five names were developed over the centuries beginning with the Horus name. Tutankhamun's original nomen, Tutankhaten, did not have a Nebty name or a Gold Falcon name associated with it as nothing has been found with the full five-name protocol. Tutankhaten was believed to mean \"Living-image-of-Aten\" as far back as 1877; however, not all Egyptologists agree with this interpretation. English Egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn believed that the older interpretation did not fit with Akhenaten's theology. Gunn believed that such an name would have been blasphemous. He saw tut as a verb and not a noun and gave his translation in 1926 as The-life-of-Aten-is-pleasing. Professor Gerhard Fecht also believed the word tut was a verb. He noted that Akhenaten used tit as a word for 'image', not tut. Fecht translated the verb tut as \"To be perfect/complete\". Using Aten as the subject, Fecht's full translation was \"One-perfect-of-life-is-Aten\". The Hermopolis Block (two carved block fragments discovered in Ashmunein) has a unique spelling of the first nomen written as Tutankhuaten; it uses ankh as a verb, which does support the older translation of Living-image-of-Aten.\n\n=== End of Amarna period ===\nOnce crowned and after \"taking counsel\" with the god Amun, Tutankhamun made several endowments that enriched and added to the priestly numbers of the cults of Amun and Ptah. He commissioned new statues of the deities from the best metals and stone and had new processional barques made of the finest cedar from Lebanon and had them embellished with gold and silver. The priests and all of the attending dancers, singers and attendants had their positions restored and a decree of royal protection granted to insure their future stability.Tutankhamun's second year as pharaoh began the return to the old Egyptian order. Both he and his queen removed 'Aten' from their names, replacing it with Amun and moved the capital from Akhetaten to Thebes. He renounced the god Aten, relegating it to obscurity and returned Egyptian religion to its polytheistic form. His first act as a pharaoh was to remove his father's mummy from his tomb at Akhetaten and rebury it in the Valley of the Kings. This helped strengthen his reign. Tutankhamun rebuilt the stelae, shrines and buildings at Karnak. He added works to Luxor as well as beginning the restoration of other temples throughout Egypt that were pillaged by Akhenaten.\n\n== Campaigns, monuments, and construction ==\nThe country was economically weak and in turmoil following the reign of Akhenaten. Diplomatic relations with other kingdoms had been neglected, and Tutankhamun sought to restore them, in particular with the Mitanni. Evidence of his success is suggested by the gifts from various countries found in his tomb. Despite his efforts for improved relations, battles with Nubians and Asiatics were recorded in his mortuary temple at Thebes. His tomb contained body armor, folding stools appropriate for military campaigns, and bows, and he was trained in archery. However, given his youth and physical disabilities, which seemed to require the use of a cane in order to walk, most historians speculate that he did not personally take part in these battles.\nGiven his age, the king probably had advisers which presumably included Ay (who succeeded Tutankhamun) and General Horemheb, Ay's possible son in law and successor. Horemheb records that the king appointed him \"lord of the land\" as hereditary prince to maintain law. He also noted his ability to calm the young king when his temper flared.In his third regnal year Tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his father's reign. He ended the worship of the god Aten and restored the god Amun to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to Thebes and the city of Akhetaten was abandoned. As part of his restoration, the king initiated building projects, in particular at Karnak in Thebes, where he laid out the sphinx avenue leading to the temple of Mut. The sphinxes were originally made for Akhenaten and Nefertiti; they were given new ram heads and small statues of the king. At Luxor temple he completed the decoration of the entrance colonnade of Amenhotep III. Monuments defaced under Akhenaten were restored, and new cult images of the god Amun were created. The traditional festivals were now celebrated again, including those related to the Apis Bull, Horemakhet, and Opet. His Restoration Stela erected in front of Karnak temple says:\nThe temples of the gods and goddesses ... were in ruins. Their shrines were deserted and overgrown. Their sanctuaries were as non-existent and their courts were used as roads ... the gods turned their backs upon this land ... If anyone made a prayer to a god for advice he would never respond.\nA building called the Temple-of-Nebkheperure-Beloved-of-Amun-Who-Puts-Thebes-in-Order, which may be identical to a building called Temple-of-Nebkheperre-in-Thebes, a possible mortuary temple, used recycled talatat from Akhenaten's east Karnak Aten temples indicating that the dismantling of these temples was already underway. Many of Tutankhamun's construction projects were uncompleted at the time of his death and were completed by or usurped by his successors, especially Horemheb. The sphinx avenue was completed by his successor Ay and the whole was usurped by Horemheb. The Restoration Stele was usurped by Horemheb; pieces of the Temple-of-Nebkheperure-in-Thebes were recycled into Horemheb's own building projects.\n\n== Health and death ==\nTutankhamun was slight of build, and roughly 167 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall. He had large front incisors and an overbite characteristic of the Thutmosid royal line to which he belonged. Analysis of the clothing found in his tomb, particularly the dimensions of his loincloths and belts indicates that he had a narrow waist and rounded hips. In attempts to explain both his unusual depiction in art and his early death it has been theorised that Tutankhamun had gynecomastia, Marfan syndrome, Wilson–Turner X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, Fröhlich syndrome (adiposogenital dystrophy), Klinefelter syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, aromatase excess syndrome in conjunction with sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, Antley–Bixler syndrome or one of its variants. It has also been suggested that he had inherited temporal lobe epilepsy in a bid to explain the religiosity of his great-grandfather Thutmose IV and father Akhenaten and their early deaths. However, caution has been urged in this diagnosis.In 1980, James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted X-ray examinations of New Kingdom Pharaoh's crania and skeletal remains, which included the mummified remains of Tutankhamun. The authors determined that the royal mummies of the 18th Dynasty bore strong similarities to contemporary Nubians with slight differences.In January 2005 Tutankhamun's mummy was CT scanned. The results showed that the young king had a partially cleft hard palate and possibly a mild case of scoliosis. Additionally, he was diagnosed with a flat right foot with hypophalangism, while his left foot was clubbed and had bone necrosis of the second and third metatarsals (Freiberg disease or  Köhler disease II). However, the clubfoot diagnosis is disputed. James Gamble instead suggests that the position is a result of Tutankhamun habitually walking on the outside of his foot due to the pain caused by Köhler disease II; this theory has been refuted by members of Hawass' team. The condition may have forced Tutankhamun to walk with the use of a cane, many of which were found in his tomb. Genetic testing through STR analysis rejected the hypothesis of gynecomastia and craniosynostoses (e.g., Antley–Bixler syndrome) or Marfan syndrome. Genetic testing for STEVOR, AMA1, or MSP1 genes specific for Plasmodium falciparum revealed indications of malaria tropica in 4 mummies, including Tutankhamun's. This is currently the oldest known genetic proof of the ailment. The team discovered DNA from several strains of the parasite, indicating that he was repeatedly infected with the most severe strain of malaria. His malaria infections may have caused a fatal immune response in the body or triggered circulatory shock. The CT scan also showed that he had experienced a compound left leg fracture. This injury being the result of modern damage was ruled out based on the ragged edges of the fracture; modern damage features sharp edges. Embalming substances were present within the fracture indicating that it was associated with an open wound; no signs of healing were present.A facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun was carried out in 2005 by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities and National Geographic. Three separate teams—Egyptian, French, and American—worked separately to approximate the face of the boy king. While the Egyptian and French teams knew their subject was Tutankhamun, the American team worked blind. All teams produced very similar results, but it was that of the French team that was ultimately cast in silicone.\n\n=== Cause of death ===\nThere are no surviving records of the circumstances of Tutankhamun's death; it has been the subject of considerable debate and major studies.\nHawass and his team postulate that his death was likely the result of the combination of his multiple weakening disorders, a leg fracture, perhaps as the result of a fall, and a severe malarial infection. However, Timmann and Meyer have argued that sickle cell anemia better fits the pathologies exhibited by the king, a suggestion the Egyptian team has called \"interesting and plausible.\"Murder by a blow to the head was theorised as a result of the 1968 x-ray which showed two bone fragments inside the skull. This theory was disproved by further analysis of the x-rays and the CT scan. The inter-cranial bone fragments were determined to be the result of the modern unwrapping of the mummy as they are loose and not adherent to the embalming resin. No evidence of bone thinning or calcified membranes, which could be indicative of a fatal blow to the head, were found. It has also been suggested that the young king was killed in a chariot accident due to a pattern of crushing injuries, including the fact that the front part of his chest wall and ribs are missing. However, the missing ribs are unlikely to be a result of an injury sustained at the time of death; photographs taken at the conclusion of Carter's excavation in 1926 show that the chest wall of the king was intact, still wearing a beaded collar with falcon-headed terminals. The absence of both the collar and chest wall was noted in the 1968 x-ray and further confirmed by the CT scan. It is likely that the front part of his chest was removed by robbers during the theft of the beaded collar; the intricate beaded skullcap the king was pictured wearing in 1926 was also missing by 1968.\n\n== Tomb ==\nTutankhamun was buried in a tomb that was unusually small considering his status. His death may have occurred unexpectedly, before the completion of a grander royal tomb, causing his mummy to be buried in a tomb intended for someone else. This would preserve the observance of the customary 70 days between death and burial. His tomb was robbed at least twice in antiquity, but based on the items taken (including perishable oils and perfumes) and the evidence of restoration of the tomb after the intrusions, these robberies likely took place within several months at most of the initial burial. The location of the tomb was lost because it had come to be buried by debris from subsequent tombs, and workers' houses were built over the tomb entrance.\n\n=== Rediscovery ===\nThe concession rights for excavating the Valley of the Kings was held by Theodore Davis from 1905 until 1914. In that time he had unearthed ten tombs including the nearly intact but non-royal tomb of Queen Tiye's parents, Yuya and Thuya. As he continued working there in the later years, he uncovered nothing of major significance. Davis did find several objects in KV58 referring to Tutankhamun, which included knobs and handles bearing his name most significantly the embalming cache of the king (KV54). He believed this to be the pharaoh's lost tomb and published his findings as such with the line; \"I fear the Valley of the Tombs is exhausted\". In 1907, Howard Carter was invited by William Garstin and Gaston Maspero to excavate for George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon in the Valley. The Earl of Carnarvon and Carter had hoped this would lead to their gaining the concession when Davis gave it up but had to be satisfied with excavations in different parts of the Theban Necropolis for seven more years.After a systematic search, beginning in 1915, Carter discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922. An ancient stroke of luck made the tomb survive to modern time. The entrance to the later and larger tomb KV9, is almost on top of the entrance to Tutankhamun's tomb. In 1145 BCE the king Ramesses V was buried here, 178 years after Tutankhamun. As KV9 was built, debri was placed over the entrance to Tutankhamun's tomb, whose exact location had been lost after almost 200 years. On top of the debri, workers shelters were also built, and the rock foundations of these shelters were still present in 1922. When Howard Carter and his colleagues realized this, that these shelters didn't exist when Tutankhamun was buried, they knew what ever lay under the foundations must be untouched since antiquity. The digging started, and after only a few days a water boy named Hussein Abdel-Rassoul, found the first step of the stairs down to Tutankhamun's tomb.By February 1923 the antechamber had been cleared of everything but two sentinel statues. A day and time were selected to unseal the tomb with about twenty appointed witnesses that included Lord Carnarvon, several Egyptian officials, museum representatives and the staff of the Government Press Bureau. On 17 February 1923 at just after two o'clock, the seal was broken.\n\n=== Contents ===\nThere were 5,398 items found in the tomb, including a solid gold coffin, face mask, thrones, archery bows, trumpets, a lotus chalice, two Imiut fetishes, gold toe stalls, furniture, food, wine, sandals, and fresh linen underwear. Howard Carter took 10 years to catalog the items. Recent analysis suggests a dagger recovered from the tomb had an iron blade made from a meteorite; study of artifacts of the time including other artifacts from Tutankhamun's tomb could provide valuable insights into metalworking technologies around the Mediterranean at the time. Many of Tutankhamun's burial goods show signs of being adapted for his use after being originally made for earlier owners, probably Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten or both.On 4 November 2007, 85 years to the day after Carter's discovery, Tutankhamun's mummy was placed on display in his underground tomb at Luxor, when the linen-wrapped mummy was removed from its golden sarcophagus to a climate-controlled glass box. The case was designed to prevent the heightened rate of decomposition caused by the humidity and warmth from tourists visiting the tomb. In 2009, the tomb was closed for restoration by the Ministry of antiquities and the Getty Conservation Institute. While the closure was originally planned for five years to restore the walls affected by humidity, the Egyptian revolution of 2011 set the project back. The tomb re-opened in February 2019.\n\n=== Rumored curse ===\nFor many years, rumors of a \"curse of the pharaohs\" (probably fueled by newspapers seeking sales at the time of the discovery) persisted, emphasizing the early death of some of those who had entered the tomb. The most prominent was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, who died on 5 April 1923, five months after the discovery of the first step leading down to the tomb on 4 November 1922.The cause of Carnarvon's death was pneumonia supervening on [facial] erysipelas (a streptococcal infection of the skin and underlying soft tissue). The Earl had been in an automobile accident in 1901 making him very unhealthy and frail. His doctor recommended a warmer climate so in 1903 the Carnarvons traveled to Egypt where the Earl became interested in Egyptology. Along with the stresses of the excavation, Carnarvon was already in a weakened state when an infection led to pneumonia.A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened, only eight died within a dozen years;  Howard Carter died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 64. The last survivors included Lady Evelyn Herbert, Lord Carnarvon's daughter who was among the first people to enter the tomb after its discovery in November 1922, who lived for a further 57 years and died in 1980, and American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman who died in 1961, 39 years after the event.\n\n== Legacy ==\nTutankhamun's fame is primarily the result of his well-preserved tomb and the global exhibitions of his associated artifacts. As Jon Manchip White writes, in his foreword to the 1977 edition of Carter's The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamun, \"The pharaoh who in life was one of the least esteemed of Egypt's Pharaohs has become in death the most renowned\".The discoveries in the tomb were prominent news in the 1920s. Tutankhamen came to be called by a modern neologism, \"King Tut\". Ancient Egyptian references became common in popular culture, including Tin Pan Alley songs; the most popular of the latter was \"Old King Tut\" by Harry Von Tilzer from 1923, which was recorded by such prominent artists of the time as Jones & Hare and Sophie Tucker. \"King Tut\" became the name of products, businesses, and the pet dog of U.S. President Herbert Hoover. While The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibit was touring the United States in 1978, comedian Steve Martin wrote a novelty song King Tut. Originally performed on Saturday Night Live, the song was released as a single and sold over a million copies.\n\n=== International exhibitions ===\nTutankhamun's artifacts have traveled the world with unprecedented visitorship. The exhibitions began in 1962 when Algeria won its independence from France. With the ending of that conflict, the Louvre Museum in Paris was quickly able to arrange an exhibition of Tutankhamun's treasures through Christiane Desroches Noblecourt. The French Egyptologist was already in Egypt as part of a UNESCO appointment. The French exhibit drew 1.2 million visitors. Noblecourt had also convinced the Egyptian Minister of Culture to allow British photographer George Rainbird to re-photograph the collection in color. The new color photos as well as the Louvre exhibition began a Tutankhamun revival.In 1965, the Tutankhamun exhibit traveled to Tokyo National Museum in Tokyo, Japan (21 August–10 October) where it garnered more visitors than the future New York exhibit in 1979. The exhibit next moved to the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art in Kyoto (15 October–28 November) with almost 1.75 million visitors, and then to the Fukuoka Prefectural Cultural Hall in Fukuoka (3 December–26 December). The blockbuster attraction exceeded all other exhibitions of Tutankhamun's treasures for the next 60 years. The Treasures of Tutankhamun tour ran from 1972 to 1979. This exhibition was first shown in London at the British Museum from 30 March until 30 September 1972. More than 1.6 million visitors saw the exhibition. The exhibition moved on to many other countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Japan, France, Canada, and West Germany. The Metropolitan Museum of Art organized the U.S. exhibition, which ran from 17 November 1976 through 15 April 1979. More than eight million attended.In 2005, Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, in partnership with Arts and Exhibitions International and the National Geographic Society, launched a tour of Tutankhamun treasures and other 18th Dynasty funerary objects, this time called Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs. It featured the same exhibits as Tutankhamen: The Golden Hereafter in a slightly different format. It was expected to draw more than three million people but exceeded that with almost four million people attending just the first four tour stops. The exhibition started in Los Angeles, then moved to Fort Lauderdale, Chicago, Philadelphia and London before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. An encore of the exhibition in the United States ran at the Dallas Museum of Art. After Dallas the exhibition moved to the de Young Museum in San Francisco, followed by the Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York City.\nThe exhibition visited Australia for the first time, opening at the Melbourne Museum for its only Australian stop before Egypt's treasures returned to Cairo in December 2011.The exhibition included 80 exhibits from the reigns of Tutankhamun's immediate predecessors in the 18th Dynasty, such as Hatshepsut, whose trade policies greatly increased the wealth of that dynasty and enabled the lavish wealth of Tutankhamun's burial artifacts, as well as 50 from Tutankhamun's tomb. The exhibition did not include the gold mask that was a feature of the 1972–1979 tour, as the Egyptian government has decided that damage which occurred to previous artifacts on tours precludes this one from joining them.In 2018, it was announced that the largest collection of Tutankhamun artifacts, amounting to forty percent of the entire collection, would be leaving Egypt again in 2019 for an international tour entitled; \"King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh\". The 2019-2022 tour began with an exhibit called; \"Tutankhamun, Pharaoh's Treasures,\" which launched in Los Angeles and then traveled to Paris. The exhibit featured at the Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris ran from March to September 2019. The exhibit featured one hundred and fifty gold coins, along with various pieces of jewelry, sculpture and carvings, as well as the renowned gold mask of Tutankhamun. Promotion of the exhibit filled the streets of Paris with posters of the event. The exhibit moved to London in November 2019 and was scheduled to travel to Boston and Sydney when the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the tour. On 28 August 2020 the artifacts that made up the temporary exhibition returned to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, and other institutions. The treasures will be permanently housed in the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Cairo, expected to open in November 2022.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n== See also ==\nAnubis Shrine\nHead of Nefertem\nTutankhamun's mummy\nTutankhamun's meteoric iron dagger\nTutankhamun's trumpets\n\n== Notes ==\n\n== Citations ==\n\n== References ==\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n== External links ==\nGrim secrets of Pharaoh's city—BBC News\nTutankhamun and the Age of the Golden Pharaohs website\nBritish Museum Tutankhamun highlight\n\"Swiss geneticists examine Tutankhamun's genetic profile\" by Reuters\nUltimate Tut Documentary produced by the PBS Series Secrets of the Dead",

      "text": "Howard Carter (9 May 1874 – 2 March 1939) was a British archaeologist and Egyptologist who discovered the intact tomb of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun in November 1922, the best-preserved pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings.\n\n== Early life ==\nHoward Carter was born in Kensington on 9 May 1874, the youngest child (of eleven) of artist and illustrator Samuel John Carter and Martha Joyce (née Sands). His father helped train and develop his artistic talents.Carter spent much of his childhood with relatives in the Norfolk market town of Swaffham, the birthplace of both his parents. Receiving only limited formal education at Swaffham, he showed talent as an artist. The nearby mansion of the Amherst family, Didlington Hall, contained a sizable collection of Egyptian antiques, which sparked Carter's interest in that subject. Lady Amherst was impressed by his artistic skills, and in 1891 she prompted the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF) to send Carter to assist an Amherst family friend, Percy Newberry, in the excavation and recording of Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan.Although only 17, Carter was innovative in improving the methods of copying tomb decoration. In 1892, he worked under the tutelage of Flinders Petrie for one season at Amarna, the capital founded by the pharaoh Akhenaten. From 1894 to 1899, he worked with Édouard Naville at Deir el-Bahari, where he recorded the wall reliefs in the temple of Hatshepsut.In 1899, Carter was appointed Inspector of Monuments for Upper Egypt in the Egyptian Antiquities Service (EAS). Based at Luxor, he oversaw a number of excavations and restorations at nearby Thebes, while in the Valley of the Kings he supervised the systematic exploration of the valley by the American archaeologist Theodore Davis. In 1904, after a dispute with local people over tomb thefts, he was transferred to the Inspectorate of Lower Egypt. Carter was praised for his improvements in the protection of, and accessibility to, existing excavation sites, and his development of a grid-block system for searching for tombs. The Antiquities Service also provided funding for Carter to head his own excavation projects.\nCarter resigned from the Antiquities Service in 1905 after a formal inquiry into what became known as the Saqqara Affair, a violent confrontation between Egyptian site guards and a group of French tourists. Carter sided with the Egyptian personnel, refusing to apologise when the French authorities made an official complaint. Moving back to Luxor, Carter was without formal employment for nearly three years. He made a living by painting and selling watercolours to tourists and, in 1906, acting as a freelance draughtsman for Theodore Davis.\n\n== Tutankhamun's tomb ==\nIn 1907, he began work for Lord Carnarvon, who employed him to supervise the excavation of nobles' tombs in Deir el-Bahri, near Thebes. Gaston Maspero, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, had recommended Carter to Carnarvon as he knew he would apply modern archaeological methods and systems of recording. Carter soon developed a good working relationship with his patron, with Lady Burghclere, Carnarvon's sister, observing that \"for the next sixteen years the two men worked together with varying fortune, yet ever united not more by their common aim than by their mutual regard and affection\".\nIn 1914, Lord Carnarvon received the concession to dig in the Valley of the Kings. Carter led the work, undertaking a systematic search for any tombs missed by previous expeditions, in particular that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. However, excavations were soon interrupted by the First World War, Carter spending the war years working for the British Government as a diplomatic courier and translator. He enthusiastically resumed his excavation work towards the end of 1917.By 1922, Lord Carnarvon had become dissatisfied with the lack of results after several years of finding little. After considering withdrawing his funding, Carnarvon agreed, after a discussion with Carter, that he would fund one more season of work in the Valley of the Kings.Carter returned to the Valley of Kings, and investigated a line of huts that he had abandoned a few seasons earlier. The crew cleared the huts and rock debris beneath. On 4 November 1922, their young water boy accidentally stumbled on a stone that turned out to be the top of a flight of steps cut into the bedrock. Carter had the steps partially dug out until the top of a mud-plastered doorway was found. The doorway was stamped with indistinct cartouches (oval seals with hieroglyphic writing). Carter ordered the staircase to be refilled, and sent a telegram to Carnarvon, who arrived from England two-and-a-half weeks later on 23 November, accompanied by his daughter Lady Evelyn Herbert.On 24 November 1922, the full extent of the stairway was cleared and a seal containing Tutankhamun's cartouche found on the outer doorway. This door was removed and the rubble-filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door of the tomb itself. On 26 November Carter, with Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and assistant Arthur Callender in attendance, made a \"tiny breach in the top left-hand corner\" of the doorway, using a chisel that his grandmother had given him for his 17th birthday. He was able to peer in by the light of a candle and see that many of the gold and ebony treasures were still in place. He did not yet know whether it was \"a tomb or merely an old cache\", but he did see a promising sealed doorway between two sentinel statues. Carnarvon asked, \"Can you see anything?\" Carter replied: \"Yes, wonderful things!\" Carter had, in fact, discovered Tutankhamun's tomb (subsequently designated KV62). The tomb was then secured, to be entered in the presence of an official of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities the next day. However that night, Carter, Carnarvon, Lady Evelyn and Callender apparently made an unauthorised visit, becoming the first people in modern times to enter the tomb. Some sources suggest that the group also entered the inner burial chamber. In this account, a small hole was found in the chamber's sealed doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through.The next morning, 27 November, saw an inspection of the tomb in the presence of an Egyptian official. Callender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a vast haul of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones, and shrines. They also saw evidence of two further chambers, including the sealed doorway to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun. In spite of evidence of break-ins in ancient times, the tomb was virtually intact, and would ultimately be found to contain over 5,000 items.\nOn 29 November the tomb was officially opened in the presence of a number of invited dignitaries and Egyptian officials.\nRealising the size and scope of the task ahead, Carter sought help from Albert Lythgoe of the Metropolitan Museum's excavation team, working nearby, who readily agreed to lend a number of his staff, including Arthur Mace and archaeological photographer Harry Burton, while the Egyptian government loaned analytical chemist Alfred Lucas. The next several months were spent cataloguing and conserving the contents of the antechamber under the \"often stressful\" supervision of Pierre Lacau, director general of the Department of Antiquities. On 16 February 1923, Carter opened the sealed doorway and confirmed it led to a burial chamber, containing the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun. The tomb was considered the best preserved and most intact pharaonic tomb ever found in the Valley of the Kings, and the discovery was eagerly covered by the world's press. However, much to the annoyance of other newspapers, Lord Carnarvon sold exclusive reporting rights to The Times. Only Arthur Merton of that paper was allowed on the scene, and his vivid descriptions helped to establish Carter's reputation with the British public.Towards the end of February 1923, a rift between Lord Carnarvon and Carter, probably caused by a disagreement on how to manage the supervising Egyptian authorities, temporarily halted the excavation. Work recommenced in early March after Lord Carnarvon apologised to Carter. Later that month Lord Carnarvon contracted blood poisoning while staying in Luxor near the tomb site. He died in Cairo on 5 April 1923. Lady Carnarvon retained her late husband's concession in the Valley of the Kings, allowing Carter to continue his work.\nCarter's meticulous assessing and cataloguing of the thousands of objects in the tomb took nearly ten years, most being moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. There were several breaks in the work, including one lasting nearly a year in 1924–25, caused by a dispute over what Carter saw as excessive control of the excavation by the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The Egyptian authorities eventually agreed that Carter should complete the tomb's clearance. This continued until 1929, with some final work lasting until February 1932.Despite the significance of his archaeological find, Carter received no honour from the British government. However, in 1926, he received the Order of the Nile, third class, from King Fuad I of Egypt. He was also awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Yale University and honorary membership in the Real Academia de la Historia of Madrid, Spain.Carter wrote a number of books on Egyptology during his career, including Five Years' Exploration at Thebes, co-written with Lord Carnarvon in 1912, describing their early excavations, and a three-volume popular account of the discovery and excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb. He also delivered a series of illustrated lectures on the excavation, including a 1924 tour of Britain, France, Spain and the United States. Those in New York and other US cities were attended by large and enthusiastic audiences, sparking American Egyptomania, with President Coolidge requesting a private lecture.In 2022, a 1934 letter to Carter from Alan Gardiner came to light, accusing him of stealing from Tutankhamun's tomb. Carter had given Gardiner an amulet and assured him it had not come from the tomb, but Reginald Engelbach, director of the Egyptian Museum, later confirmed its match with other samples originating in the tomb. Egyptologist Bob Brier said the letter proved previous rumours, and the contemporary suspicions of Egyptian authorities, that Carter had been siphoning treasures for himself.\n\n== Personal life ==\nCarter could be awkward in company, particularly with those of a higher social standing. Often abrasive, he admitted to having a hot temper, which often aggravated disputes, including the 1905 Saqqara Affair and the 1924–25 dispute with Egyptian authorities.\nThe suggestion that Carter had an affair with Lady Evelyn Herbert, the daughter of the 5th Earl of Carnarvon, was later rejected by Lady Evelyn herself, who told her daughter Patricia that \"at first I was in awe of him, later I was rather frightened of him\", resenting Carter's \"determination\" to come between her and her father. More recently, the 8th Earl dismissed the idea, describing Carter as a \"stoical loner\". Harold Plenderleith, a former associate of Carter's at the British Museum, was quoted as saying that he knew \"something about Carter that was not fit to disclose\", perhaps suggesting that Plenderleith believed that Carter was homosexual. There is, however, no evidence that Carter enjoyed any close relationships throughout his life, and he never married nor had children.\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter the clearance of the tomb had been completed in 1932 Carter retired from excavation work. He continued to live in his house near Luxor in winter and retained a flat in London but, as interest in Tutankhamun declined, he lived a fairly isolated existence with few close friends.He had acted as a part-time dealer for both collectors and museums for a number of years. He continued in this role, including acting for the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\n== Death ==\nCarter died at his London flat at 49 Albert Court, next to the Royal Albert Hall, on 2 March 1939, aged 64 from Hodgkin's disease. He was buried in Putney Vale Cemetery in London on 6 March, nine people attending his funeral.His love for Egypt remained strong; his epitaph on his gravestone reading: \"May your spirit live, may you spend millions of years, you who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness\", a quotation taken from the Wishing Cup of Tutankhamun, and \"O night, spread thy wings over me as the imperishable stars\".Probate was granted on 5 July 1939 to Egyptologist Henry Burton and to publisher Bruce Sterling Ingram. Carter is described as Howard Carter of Luxor, Upper Egypt, Africa, and of 49 Albert Court, Kensington Grove, Kensington, London. His estate was valued at £2,002. The second grant of Probate was issued in Cairo on 1 September 1939. In his role as executor, Burton identified at least 18 items in Carter's antiquities collection that had been taken from Tutankhamun's tomb without authorisation. As this was a sensitive matter that could affect Anglo-Egyptian relations, Burton sought wider advice, finally recommending that the items be discreetly presented or sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with most eventually going either there or to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The Metropolitan Museum items were later returned to Egypt.\n\n== Selected publications ==\nThe Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen (1923) (written together with A. C. Mace)\nThe Tomb of Tutankhamun: Volume I — Search, Discovery and Clearance of the Antechamber (1923) (written together with A. C. Mace)\nThe Tomb of Tutankhamun: Volume II — Burial Chamber & Mummy (1927)\nThe Tomb of Tutankhamun: Volume III — Treasury & Annex (1933)\n\n== In popular culture ==\nCarter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb revived popular interest in Ancient Egypt – 'Egyptomania' – and created \"Tutmania\", which influenced popular song and fashion. Carter used this heightened interest to promote his books on the discovery and his lecture tours in Britain, America and Europe. While interest had waned by the mid-1930s, from the early 1970s touring exhibitions of the tomb's artefacts led to a sustained rise in popularity. This has been reflected in TV dramas, films and books, with Carter's quest and discovery of the tomb portrayed with varying levels of accuracy.One common element in popular representations of the excavation is the idea of a 'curse'. Carter consistently dismissed the suggestion as 'tommy-rot', commenting that \"the sentiment of the Egyptologist ... is not one of fear, but of respect and awe ... entirely opposed to foolish superstitions\".\n\n=== Dramas ===\nCarter has been portrayed or referred to in many film, television and radio productions:\nIn the BBC Radio play The Tomb of Tutankhamen, written by Leonard Cottrell and first broadcast in 1949, he is voiced by Jack Hawkins.\nIn the Columbia Pictures Television film The Curse of King Tut's Tomb (1980), he is portrayed by Robin Ellis.\nIn the 1981 film Sphinx, he is portrayed by Mark Kingston.\nIn the Lucasfilm TV films Young Indiana Jones and the Curse of the Jackal (1992) and Young Indiana Jones and the Treasure of the Peacock's Eye (1995), he is portrayed by Pip Torrens.\nIn the IMAX documentary Mysteries of Egypt (1998), he is portrayed by Timothy Davies.\nIn the made-for-TV film The Tutankhamun Conspiracy (2001), he is portrayed by Giles Watling.\nIn an episode of 2005 BBC docudrama Egypt, he is portrayed by Stuart Graham.\nHe was portrayed in the 2008 Big Finish Radio Drama Forty-five, a title in the Doctor Who range, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch.\nAs the main character in 2016 ITV miniseries Tutankhamun, portrayed by Max Irons.\n\n=== Literature ===\nHe is referenced in Hergé's volume 13 of The Adventures of Tintin: The Seven Crystal Balls (1948).\nHe is parodied in the 1979 book Motel of the Mysteries by David Macaulay, with a character in the book named Howard Carson.\nHe is a key character in Christian Jacq's 1992 book The Tutankhamun Affair.\nJames Patterson and Martin Dugard's 2010 book The Murder of King Tut focuses on Carter's search for King Tut's tomb.\nHe appears as a main character in Muhammad Al-Mansi Qindeel's 2010 novel A Cloudy Day on the West Side.\nIn Laura Lee Guhrke's 2011 historical romance novel Wedding of the Season, Carter's telegram to the fictional British Egyptologist, the Duke of Sunderland, reports discovering \"steps to a new tomb\" and creates a climactic conflict.\nHe is referenced in Sally Beauman's 2014 novel The Visitors, a re-creation of the hunt for Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt's Valley of the Kings.\nHe is a main character in Philipp Vandenberg's 2001 German language book Der König von Luxor (The King Of Luxor).\nHe is a recurring figure in the 1975-2010 Amelia Peabody series, written by Barbara Mertz under the pseudonym Elizabeth Peters.

      "text": "Lady Evelyn Leonora Almina Beauchamp ( BEE-chəm; née Herbert; 15 August 1901 – 31 January 1980) was the daughter of George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon. In November 1922, she, her father and the archaeologist Howard Carter were the first people in modern times to enter the tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun. She later married Sir Brograve Beauchamp and had a daughter. Lady Evelyn died in 1980, at the age of 78.\n\n== Early life ==\nLady Evelyn Leonora Almina Herbert was born on 15 August 1901, the second child and only daughter of George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon and Almina Herbert, Countess of Carnarvon. Her older brother was Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon.Her childhood was spent mainly at Highclere Castle, the family's country house in Hampshire. Looked after by a nanny and a governess, she and her brother were seldom in the company of her parents. As Evelyn grew older she however became closer to her father, her brother observing that she became \"the apple of my father's eye – he worshipped her and they were the closest of friends until he died. She had a great influence of good on him and healed many a breach between my father and mother which no-one else could have achieved\". From 1920, she accompanied him on his annual visit to Egypt. Journeying to Egypt in January 1923, the journalist Valentine Williams noted \"the tender friendship\" between father and daughter that was \"delightful to watch\", while Howard Carter referred to Evelyn as her father's \"devoted companion in all his Egyptian work\".Lady Evelyn was launched as a debutante and presented at court in 1920, with her mother staging receptions for her, including at the British Residency in Cairo during their Egyptian stays in 1921 and 1922. It was during one of these receptions that she met her future husband, Brograve Beauchamp, the son of the Liberal MP Sir Edward Beauchamp, who continued to visit her when they both returned to England.\n\n== Tutankhamun's Tomb ==\nLord and Lady Carnarvon often spent the winter in Egypt, where they bought antiquities for their collection in England. In 1906 Lord Carnarvon obtained a concession to excavate sites near Luxor. From 1907, Lord Carnarvon employed Howard Carter to supervise this work including, from 1914, a systematic search of the Valley of the Kings for any tombs missed by previous expeditions, in particular that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. By 1922 little of significance had been found and Lord Carnarvon decided this would be the final year he would fund the work.However, on 4 November 1922, Carter was able to send a telegram to Lord Carnarvon, in England at the time, saying:\"At last have made wonderful discovery in Valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact; re-covered same for your arrival; congratulations\".Lady Evelyn accompanied her father to Egypt, and arrived at Luxor on 23 November 1922. Both were present the next day when the full extent of the stairway to the tomb was cleared and a seal containing Tutankhamun's cartouche found on the outer doorway. This door was removed and the rubble filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door of the tomb itself. Lady Evelyn was also present when, on 26 November, Carter made a tiny breach in the top left hand corner of the tomb doorway, enabling him to peer in by the light of a candle. When Carnarvon asked, \"Can you see anything?\" Carter replied \"Yes, wonderful things!\". The tomb was then secured, to be entered in the presence of an official of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities the next day.However that night, Carter, his assistant Arthur Callender, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn apparently made an unauthorised visit, becoming the first people in modern times to enter the tomb. Some sources suggest that the group also entered the inner burial chamber. In this account, a small hole was found in the chamber's sealed doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through. The diary of Lord Carnarvon's half-brother Mervyn Herbert notes that Evelyn told him that the group entered the 'second chamber', and that Evelyn, being the smallest, was the first to enter the burial chamber.The next morning, the 27 November, saw an inspection of the tomb in the presence of an Egyptian official. Callender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a vast haul of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones, and shrines. They also saw evidence of two further chambers, including the sealed doorway to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun. In spite of evidence of break-ins in ancient times, the tomb was virtually intact, and would ultimately be found to contain over 5,000 items.\nOn 29 November the tomb was officially opened in the presence of a number of invited dignitaries and Egyptian officials, with Evelyn arranging a luncheon party afterwards for the guests.Lady Evelyn and her father travelled to England in December 1922, the two returning in January 1923 to be present at the official opening of the inner burial chamber on 16 February. The same month Brograve Beauchamp visited with his parents, Howard Carter providing a tour of Tutankhamun's Tomb. Soon afterwards Lord Carnarvon contracted blood poisoning and, after travelling to Cairo with Evelyn, he died on 5 April 1923. Lady Evelyn left Egypt to return to England with her brother, Lady Carnarvon following with Lord Carnarvon's remains a week later. This was Evelyn's last visit to Egypt. She did, however, maintain contact with Howard Carter and was present at his funeral at Putney Vale Cemetery in 1939.Lady Evelyn attended the opening of the Tutankhamun 50th anniversary celebrations in 1972, including the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition at the British Museum, London, where she was presented to the Queen who was there to open the exhibition.\n\n== Marriage and later life ==\nOn 8 October 1923, Lady Evelyn Herbert married Brograve Beauchamp at St Margaret's, Westminster. They had one child, Patricia Evelyn Beauchamp (11 July 1925 – 7 October 2014), who in 1949 married Major Michael William Thomas Leatham, and had two sons, Simon Anthony Michael Leatham (born 1951) and Edward Arthur Martyn Leatham (born 1953).Brograve became a baronet on the death of his father in February 1925. He served as Conservative Member of Parliament for Walthamstow East from 1931 to 1945, and died 25 August 1976 at the age of 79.Like her father and brother, Lady Evelyn owned a number of racehorses and often attended race meetings, being described in the press as \"petite, charming and immensely popular in racing circles\". She was also closely involved in London Society and regularly appeared in Society publications like The Tatler. She remained on close terms with her to brother Henry, and helped supervise the refurbishment and modernisation of Highclere after Henry became 6th Earl.In July 1935 she was injured in a serious car accident on her way to Newmarket, Suffolk, and recuperated in the London nursing home established by her mother during the First World War. She later suffered from a number of strokes.Lady Evelyn died in London on 31 January 1980 aged 78, three years after Sir Brograve. She is buried beside her husband in Putney Vale Cemetery in South West London. Howard Carter is also buried at Putney Vale.\n\n== Relationship with Howard Carter ==\nLady Evelyn had known Howard Carter since she was a child, with Carter often visiting the Carnarvon's homes in London and Hampshire. From 1920, Evelyn began to accompany her father on his annual winter trips to Egypt, where she and Carter were on friendly terms. While there were later suggestions of a discreet romantic relationship between the two, there is no evidence of any rumour or gossip among those present at the time. Lady Evelyn denied the idea, later telling her daughter Patricia that \"at first I was in awe of him, later I was rather frightened of him\", she resenting Carter's \"determination\" to come between her and her father. More recently, the 8th Earl of Carnarvon dismissed the story, describing Carter as a \"stoical loner\".\n\n== In popular culture ==\nLady Evelyn Herbert has been portrayed in films, television productions, and fiction, with varying degrees of accuracy:\nBy Angharad Rees in the 1980 Columbia Pictures Television production The Curse of King Tut's Tomb.\nBy Alexandra Weaver in the 2005 BBC TV docudrama series Egypt, episodes one The Search for Tutankhamun, and two The Curse of Tutankhamun.\nBy Amy Wren in the 2016 British ITV series Tutankhamun.\nIn the movie Stargate (1994) and the TV series Stargate: SG-1, the character Catherine Langford (played by numerous actresses) is based on Evelyn Herbert.\nIn The Mummy (1999) and its sequels The Mummy Returns (2001) and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), the character Evelyn Carnahan, played at different points of the series by Rachel Weisz and Maria Bello, is named in tribute to Lady Evelyn Carnarvon, whose father is described as one of Egyptology's \"finest patrons\", and a \"famous explorer\".The German language novel Der König von Luxor by Philipp Vandenberg published in 2014 includes a largely fictionalised Lady Evelyn Beauchamp as one of the three principal characters.The novel The Collector's Daughter by Gill Paul published in 2021 offers a fictional version of Lady Evelyn against a backdrop of the events at the time of the tomb's discovery.\n\nDATES IN HER LIFE\n1901,1980,1922,1980,1901,1920,1923,1920,1921,1922,1906,1907,1914,1922,1922,1922,1922,1923,1923,1972,1923,1925,2014,1949,1951,1953,1925,1931,1945,1976,1935,1980,1920,1980,2005,2016,1994,1999,2001,2008,2014,2021,1923,2016,1976,1980,1978,1942,2007,2006,2011,2013,2019,2022,2022\nNewmarket,England,Brograve Beauchamp,Parliament,Edward Arthur Martyn Leatham,West London,William P.

      "text": "Nazi Germany, officially known as the German Reich from 1933 until 1943, and the Greater German Reich from 1943 to 1945, was the German state between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party controlled the country, transforming it into a dictatorship. Under Hitler's rule, Germany quickly became a totalitarian state where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich, meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluded to the Nazi claim that Nazi Germany was the successor to the earlier Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) and German Empire (1871–1918). The Third Reich, which Hitler and the Nazis referred to as the Thousand-Year Reich, ended in May 1945 after just 12 years when the Allies defeated Germany, ending World War II in Europe.\nOn 30 January 1933, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany, the head of government, by the president of the Weimar Republic, Paul von Hindenburg, the head of state. The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the chancellery and presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Using deficit spending, the regime undertook a massive secret rearmament program, forming the Wehrmacht (armed forces), and constructed extensive public works projects, including the Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\nRacism, Nazi eugenics, and especially antisemitism, were central ideological features of the regime. The Germanic peoples were considered by the Nazis to be the master race, the purest branch of the Aryan race. Discrimination and the persecution of Jews and Romani people began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first concentration camps were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were murdered, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that opposed Hitler's rule were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program, and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased Germany on the international stage. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\nFrom the latter half of the 1930s, Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. The Saarland voted by plebiscite to rejoin Germany in 1935, and in 1936 Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland, which had been demilitarized after World War I. Germany seized Austria in the Anschluss of 1938, and demanded and received the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia in that same year. In March 1939, the Slovak state was proclaimed and became a client state of Germany, and the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was established on the remainder of the occupied Czech Lands. Shortly after, Germany pressured Lithuania into ceding the Memel Territory. Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. By late 1942, Germany and its European allies in the Axis powers controlled much of Europe and North Africa. Extended offices of the Reichskommissariat took control of Nazi-conquered areas and a German administration was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies.\nGenocide, mass murder, and large-scale forced labour became hallmarks of the regime. Starting in 1939, hundreds of thousands of German citizens with mental or physical disabilities were murdered in hospitals and asylums. Einsatzgruppen paramilitary death squads accompanied the German armed forces inside the occupied territories and conducted the genocide of millions of Jews and other Holocaust victims. After 1941, millions of others were imprisoned, worked to death, or murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. This genocide is known as the Holocaust.\nWhile the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the United States into the war meant that the Wehrmacht lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the Allied invasion of France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allies from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.\n\n== Name ==\nCommon English terms for the German state in the Nazi era are \"Nazi Germany\" and the \"Third Reich\", which Hitler and the Nazis also referred to as the \"Thousand-Year Reich\" (Tausendjähriges Reich). The latter, a translation of the Nazi propaganda term Drittes Reich, was first used in Das Dritte Reich, a 1923 book by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. The book counted the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) as the first Reich and the German Empire (1871–1918) as the second.\n\n== Background ==\nGermany was known as the Weimar Republic during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a republic with a semi-presidential system. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the Allied victors of World War I, and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties. Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots. When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.The National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei), commonly known as the Nazi Party, was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the German Workers' Party (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several far-right political parties then active in Germany. The Nazi Party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights. The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the Völkisch movement. The party, especially its paramilitary organisation Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members as well as Jewish people on the streets. Such far-right armed groups were common in Bavaria, and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of Gustav Ritter von Kahr.When the stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929, the effect in Germany was dire. Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazis prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs. Many voters decided the Nazi Party was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the federal election of 1932, the party was the largest in the Reichstag, holding 230 seats with 37.4 per cent of the popular vote.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung (\"seizure of power\").On the night of 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set afire. Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The Reichstag Fire Decree, imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the Communist Party of Germany were arrested.In March 1933, the Enabling Act, an amendment to the Weimar Constitution, passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94. This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws—even laws that violated the constitution—without the consent of the president or the Reichstag. As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned. On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June. On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party – their former coalition partners – which then disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a one-party state with the passage of a law decreeing the Nazi Party to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned. The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the Nazis established. Further elections in November 1933, 1936, and 1938 were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the Party and a small number of independents elected.\n\n=== Nazification of Germany ===\nThe Hitler cabinet used the terms of the Reichstag Fire Decree and later the Enabling Act to initiate the process of Gleichschaltung (\"co-ordination\"), which brought all aspects of life under party control. Individual states not controlled by elected Nazi governments or Nazi-led coalitions were forced to agree to the appointment of Reich Commissars to bring the states in line with the policies of the central government. These Commissars had the power to appoint and remove local governments, state parliaments, officials, and judges. In this way Germany became a de facto unitary state, with all state governments controlled by the central government under the Nazis. The state parliaments and the Reichsrat (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934, with all state powers being transferred to the central government.All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members; these civic organisations either merged with the Nazi Party or faced dissolution. The Nazi government declared a \"Day of National Labor\" for May Day 1933, and invited many trade union delegates to Berlin for celebrations. The day after, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country; all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed in April, removed from their jobs all teachers, professors, judges, magistrates, and government officials who were Jewish or whose commitment to the party was suspect. This meant the only non-political institutions not under control of the Nazis were the churches.The Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic—including the black, red, and gold tricolour flag—and adopted reworked symbolism. The previous imperial black, white, and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany's two official flags; the second was the swastika flag of the Nazi Party, which became the sole national flag in 1935. The Party anthem \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" (\"Horst Wessel Song\") became a second national anthem.Germany was still in a dire economic situation, as six million people were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken beginning in 1934, creating 1.7 million new jobs by the end of that year alone. Average wages began to rise.\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe SA leadership continued to apply pressure for greater political and military power. In response, Hitler used the Schutzstaffel (SS) and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership. Hitler targeted SA Stabschef (Chief of Staff) Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who—along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher)—were arrested and shot. Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives.On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich\", which stated that upon Hindenburg's death the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (\"Leader and Chancellor\"), although eventually Reichskanzler was dropped. Germany was now a totalitarian state with Hitler at its head. As head of state, Hitler became Supreme Commander of the armed forces. The new law provided an altered loyalty oath for servicemen so that they affirmed loyalty to Hitler personally rather than the office of supreme commander or the state. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 per cent of the electorate in a plebiscite.\nMost Germans were relieved that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and plenty for all in a united, Marxist-free country without the constraints of the Versailles Treaty. The Nazi Party obtained and legitimised power through its initial revolutionary activities, then through manipulation of legal mechanisms, the use of police powers, and by taking control of the state and federal institutions. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created by the end of the war.Beginning in April 1933, scores of measures defining the status of Jews and their rights were instituted. These measures culminated in the establishment of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which stripped them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews, and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as law, medicine, or education). Eventually the Nazis declared the Jews as undesirable to remain among German citizens and society.\n\n=== Military build-up ===\nIn the early years of the regime, Germany was without allies, and its military was drastically weakened by the Versailles Treaty. France, Poland, Italy, and the Soviet Union each had reasons to object to Hitler's rise to power. Poland suggested to France that the two nations engage in a preventive war against Germany in March 1933. Fascist Italy objected to German claims in the Balkans and on Austria, which Benito Mussolini considered to be in Italy's sphere of influence.As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must begin, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. On 17 May 1933, Hitler gave a speech before the Reichstag outlining his desire for world peace and accepted an offer from American President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military disarmament, provided the other nations of Europe did the same. When the other European powers failed to accept this offer, Hitler pulled Germany out of the World Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations in October, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair if they applied only to Germany. In a referendum held in November, 95 per cent of voters supported Germany's withdrawal.In 1934, Hitler told his military leaders that a war in the east should begin in 1942. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced the creation of an air force, and that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men. Britain agreed to Germany building a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.When the Italian invasion of Ethiopia led to only mild protests by the British and French governments, on 7 March 1936 Hitler used the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance as a pretext to order the army to march 3,000 troops into the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in violation of the Versailles Treaty. As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war. In the one-party election held on 29 March, the Nazis received 98.9 per cent support. In 1936, Hitler signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and a non-aggression agreement with Mussolini, who was soon referring to a \"Rome-Berlin Axis\".Hitler sent military supplies and assistance to the Nationalist forces of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War, which began in July 1936. The German Condor Legion included a range of aircraft and their crews, as well as a tank contingent. The aircraft of the Legion destroyed the city of Guernica in 1937. The Nationalists were victorious in 1939 and became an informal ally of Nazi Germany.\n\n==== Austria and Czechoslovakia ====\nIn February 1938, Hitler emphasised to Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg the need for Germany to secure its frontiers. Schuschnigg scheduled a plebiscite regarding Austrian independence for 13 March, but Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March demanding that he hand over all power to the Austrian Nazi Party or face an invasion. German troops entered Austria the next day, to be greeted with enthusiasm by the populace.The Republic of Czechoslovakia was home to a substantial minority of Germans, who lived mostly in the Sudetenland. Under pressure from separatist groups within the Sudeten German Party, the Czechoslovak government offered economic concessions to the region. Hitler decided not just to incorporate the Sudetenland into the Reich, but to destroy the country of Czechoslovakia entirely. The Nazis undertook a propaganda campaign to try to generate support for an invasion. Top German military leaders opposed the plan, as Germany was not yet ready for war.The crisis led to war preparations by Britain, Czechoslovakia, and France (Czechoslovakia's ally). Attempting to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain arranged a series of meetings, the result of which was the Munich Agreement, signed on 29 September 1938. The Czechoslovak government was forced to accept the Sudetenland's annexation into Germany. Chamberlain was greeted with cheers when he landed in London, saying the agreement brought \"peace for our time\". In addition to the German annexation, Poland seized a narrow strip of land near Cieszyn on 2 October, while as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, Hungary demanded and received 12,000 square kilometres (4,600 sq mi) along their northern border in the First Vienna Award on 2 November. Following negotiations with President Emil Hácha, Hitler seized the rest of the Czech half of the country on 15 March 1939 and created the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, one day after the proclamation of the Slovak Republic in the Slovak half. Also on 15 March, Hungary occupied and annexed the recently proclaimed and unrecognised Carpatho-Ukraine and an additional sliver of land disputed with Slovakia.Austrian and Czech foreign exchange reserves were seized by the Nazis, as were stockpiles of raw materials such as metals and completed goods such as weaponry and aircraft, which were shipped to Germany. The Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate took control of steel and coal production facilities in both countries.\n\n==== Poland ====\nIn January 1934, Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Poland. In March 1939, Hitler demanded the return of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would come to the aid of Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland. He expected this time they would be met by force.The Germans reaffirmed their alliance with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia, and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway, and Sweden. Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged in negotiations with the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in August 1939. The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet spheres of influence.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nGermany's wartime foreign policy involved the creation of allied governments controlled directly or indirectly from Berlin. They intended to obtain soldiers from allies such as Italy and Hungary and workers and food supplies from allies such as Vichy France. Hungary was the fourth nation to join the Axis, signing the Tripartite Pact on 27 September 1940. Bulgaria signed the pact on 17 November. German efforts to secure oil included negotiating a supply from their new ally, Romania, who signed the Pact on 23 November, alongside the Slovak Republic. By late 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy, and 10 from Hungary. Germany assumed full control in France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was a powerful ally, the relationship was distant, with little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.\n\n==== Outbreak of war ====\nGermany invaded Poland and captured the Free City of Danzig on 1 September 1939, beginning World War II in Europe. Honouring their treaty obligations, Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. Poland fell quickly, as the Soviet Union attacked from the east on 17 September. Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police) and Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), ordered on 21 September that Polish Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport them further east, or possibly to Madagascar. Using lists prepared in advance, some 65,000 Polish intelligentsia, noblemen, clergy, and teachers were murdered by the end of 1939 in an attempt to destroy Poland's identity as a nation. Soviet forces advanced into Finland in the Winter War, and German forces saw action at sea. But little other activity occurred until May, so the period became known as the \"Phoney War\".From the start of the war, a British blockade on shipments to Germany affected its economy. Germany was particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal, and grain. Thanks to trade embargoes and the blockade, imports into Germany declined by 80 per cent. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered the invasion of Denmark and Norway, which began on 9 April. Denmark fell after less than a day, while most of Norway followed by the end of the month. By early June, Germany occupied all of Norway.\n\n==== Conquest of Europe ====\nAgainst the advice of many of his senior military officers, in May 1940 Hitler ordered an attack on France and the Low Countries. They quickly conquered Luxembourg and the Netherlands and outmanoeuvred the Allies in Belgium, forcing the evacuation of many British and French troops at Dunkirk. France fell as well, surrendering to Germany on 22 June. The victory in France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and an upsurge in war fever in Germany.In violation of the provisions of the Hague Convention, industrial firms in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium were put to work producing war materiel for Germany.\nThe Nazis seized from the French thousands of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles of weapons, and raw materials such as copper, tin, oil, and nickel. Payments for occupation costs were levied upon France, Belgium, and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets, and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most of Europe. Famine was experienced in many occupied countries.Hitler's peace overtures to the new British Prime Minister Winston Churchill were rejected in July 1940. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder had advised Hitler in June that air superiority was a pre-condition for a successful invasion of Britain, so Hitler ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force (RAF) airbases and radar stations, as well as nightly air raids on British cities, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the RAF in what became known as the Battle of Britain, and by the end of October, Hitler realised that air superiority would not be achieved. He permanently postponed the invasion, a plan which the commanders of the German army had never taken entirely seriously. Several historians, including Andrew Gordon, believe the primary reason for the failure of the invasion plan was the superiority of the Royal Navy, not the actions of the RAF.In February 1941, the German Afrika Korps arrived in Libya to aid the Italians in the North African Campaign. On 6 April, Germany launched an invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. All of Yugoslavia and parts of Greece were subsequently divided between Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Bulgaria.\n\n==== Invasion of the Soviet Union ====\nOn 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, about 3.8 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive—codenamed Operation Barbarossa—was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would continue or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.\nThe invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic states, Belarus, and west Ukraine. After the successful Battle of Smolensk in September 1941, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kyiv. This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.Food was in short supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, as the retreating armies had burned the crops in some areas, and much of the remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany, rations were cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was good, and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.Germany and Europe as a whole were almost totally dependent on foreign oil imports. In an attempt to resolve the shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (\"Case Blue\"), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but this turned out to be infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war.\n\n==== Turning point and collapse ====\nLosses continued to mount after Stalingrad, leading to a sharp reduction in the popularity of the Nazi Party and deteriorating morale. Soviet forces continued to push westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943. By the end of 1943, the Germans had lost most of their eastern territorial gains. In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were defeated by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany. Many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets in an effort to destroy German morale. The bombing of aircraft factories as well as Peenemünde Army Research Center, where V-1 and V-2 rockets were being developed and produced, were also deemed particularly important. German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses, and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.On 6 June 1944, American, British, and Canadian forces established a front in France with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler survived an assassination attempt. He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000 arrests and the execution of more than 4,900 people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive on the western front, and Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the war's closing months. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who was not prepared to fight should be court-martialed, and thousands of people were executed. In many areas, people surrendered to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue to fight. Hitler ordered the destruction of transport, bridges, industries, and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer prevented this order from being fully carried out.\nDuring the Battle of Berlin (16 April 1945 – 2 May 1945), Hitler and his staff lived in the underground Führerbunker while the Red Army approached. On 30 April, when Soviet troops were within two blocks of the Reich Chancellery, Hitler, along with his girlfriend and by then wife Eva Braun committed suicide. On 2 May, General Helmuth Weidling unconditionally surrendered Berlin to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov. Hitler was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Reich President and Goebbels as Reich Chancellor. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide the next day after murdering their six children. Between 4 and 8 May 1945, most of the remaining German armed forces unconditionally surrendered. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed 8 May, marking the end of the Nazi regime and the end of World War II in Europe.Popular support for Hitler almost completely disappeared as the war drew to a close. Suicide rates in Germany increased, particularly in areas where the Red Army was advancing. Among soldiers and party personnel, suicide was often deemed an honourable and heroic alternative to surrender. First-hand accounts and propaganda about the uncivilised behaviour of the advancing Soviet troops caused panic among civilians on the Eastern Front, especially women, who feared being raped. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians, and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead), and Berlin, where at least 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.\n\n==== German casualties ====\nEstimates of the total German war dead range from 5.5 to 6.9 million persons. A study by German historian Rüdiger Overmans puts the number of German military dead and missing at 5.3 million, including 900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders. Richard Overy estimated in 2014 that about 353,000 civilians were killed in Allied air raids. Other civilian deaths include 300,000 Germans (including Jews) who were victims of Nazi political, racial, and religious persecution and 200,000 who were murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program. Political courts called Sondergerichte sentenced some 12,000 members of the German resistance to death, and civil courts sentenced an additional 40,000 Germans. Mass rapes of German women also took place.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Territorial changes ===\nAs a result of their defeat in World War I and the resulting Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine, Northern Schleswig, and Memel. The Saarland became a protectorate of France under the condition that its residents would later decide by referendum which country to join, and Poland became a separate nation and was given access to the sea by the creation of the Polish Corridor, which separated Prussia from the rest of Germany, while Danzig was made a free city.Germany regained control of the Saarland through a referendum held in 1935 and annexed Austria in the Anschluss of 1938. The Munich Agreement of 1938 gave Germany control of the Sudetenland, and they seized the remainder of Czechoslovakia six months later. Under threat of invasion by sea, Lithuania surrendered the Memel district in March 1939.Between 1939 and 1941, German forces invaded Poland, Denmark, Norway, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Soviet Union. Germany annexed parts of northern Yugoslavia in April 1941, while Mussolini ceded Trieste, South Tyrol, and Istria to Germany in 1943.\n\n=== Occupied territories ===\nSome of the conquered territories were incorporated into Germany as part of Hitler's long-term goal of creating a Greater Germanic Reich. Several areas, such as Alsace-Lorraine, were placed under the authority of an adjacent Gau (regional district). The Reichskommissariate (Reich Commissariats), quasi-colonial regimes, were established in some occupied countries. Areas placed under German administration included the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Reichskommissariat Ostland (encompassing the Baltic states and Belarus), and Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Conquered areas of Belgium and France were placed under control of the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France. Belgian Eupen-Malmedy, which had been part of Germany until 1919, was annexed. Part of Poland was incorporated into the Reich, and the General Government was established in occupied central Poland. The governments of Denmark, Norway (Reichskommissariat Norwegen), and the Netherlands (Reichskommissariat Niederlande) were placed under civilian administrations staffed largely by natives. Hitler intended to eventually incorporate many of these areas into the Reich. Germany occupied the Italian protectorate of Albania and the Italian governorate of Montenegro in 1943 and installed a puppet government in occupied Serbia in 1941.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Ideology ===\nThe Nazis were a far-right fascist political party which arose during the social and financial upheavals that occurred following the end of World War I. The Party remained small and marginalised, receiving 2.6% of the federal vote in 1928, prior to the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. By 1930 the Party won 18.3% of the federal vote, making it the Reichstag's second largest political party. While in prison after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, which laid out his plan for transforming German society into one based on race. Nazi ideology brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more Lebensraum for the Germanic people. The regime attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or murder the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race and part of a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy. The Nazi regime believed that only Germany could defeat the forces of Bolshevism and save humanity from world domination by International Jewry. Other people deemed life unworthy of life by the Nazis included the mentally and physically disabled, Romani people, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and social misfits. Additionally, Freemasons were heavily monitored and persecuted.Influenced by the Völkisch movement, the regime was against cultural modernism and supported the development of an extensive military at the expense of intellectualism. Creativity and art were stifled, except where they could serve as propaganda media. The party used symbols such as the Blood Flag and rituals such as the Nazi Party rallies to foster unity and bolster the regime's popularity.\n\n=== Government ===\nHitler ruled Germany autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip (\"leader principle\"), which called for absolute obedience by all subordinates. He viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Party rank was not determined by elections, and positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank. The party used propaganda to develop a cult of personality around Hitler. Historians such as Kershaw emphasise the psychological impact of Hitler's skill as an orator. Roger Gill states: \"His moving speeches captured the minds and hearts of a vast number of the German people: he virtually hypnotized his audiences\".While top officials reported to Hitler and followed his policies, they had considerable autonomy. He expected officials to \"work towards the Führer\" – to take the initiative in promoting policies and actions in line with party goals and Hitler's wishes, without his involvement in day-to-day decision-making. The government was a disorganised collection of factions led by the party elite, who struggled to amass power and gain the Führer's favour. Hitler's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them in positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.Successive Reichsstatthalter decrees between 1933 and 1935 abolished the existing Länder (constituent states) of Germany and replaced them with new administrative divisions, the Gaue, governed by Nazi leaders (Gauleiters). The change was never fully implemented, as the Länder were still used as administrative divisions for some government departments such as education. This led to a bureaucratic tangle of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities typical of the administrative style of the Nazi regime.Jewish civil servants lost their jobs in 1933, except for those who had seen military service in World War I. Members of the Party or party supporters were appointed in their place. As part of the process of Gleichschaltung, the Reich Local Government Law of 1935 abolished local elections, and mayors were appointed by the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n=== Law ===\nIn August 1934, civil servants and members of the military were required to swear an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler. These laws became the basis of the Führerprinzip, the concept that Hitler's word overrode all existing laws. Any acts that were sanctioned by Hitler—even murder—thus became legal. All legislation proposed by cabinet ministers had to be approved by the office of Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess, who could also veto top civil service appointments.Most of the judicial system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in place to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.\nA new type of court, the Volksgerichtshof (\"People's Court\"), was established in 1934 to deal with political cases. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets, or even making jokes about Hitler or other officials. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce Nazi ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews, and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.The Nazis used propaganda to promulgate the concept of Rassenschande (\"race defilement\") to justify the need for racial laws. In September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. These laws initially prohibited sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\". The law also forbade the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households. The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of \"German or related blood\" could be citizens. Thus Jews and other non-Aryans were stripped of their German citizenship. The law also permitted the Nazis to deny citizenship to anyone who was not supportive enough of the regime. A supplementary decree issued in November defined as Jewish anyone with three Jewish grandparents, or two grandparents if the Jewish faith was followed.\n\n== Military and paramilitary ==\n\n=== Wehrmacht ===\nThe unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 to 1945 were called the Wehrmacht (defence force). This included the Heer (army), Kriegsmarine (navy), and the Luftwaffe (air force). From 2 August 1934, members of the armed forces were required to pledge an oath of unconditional obedience to Hitler personally. In contrast to the previous oath, which required allegiance to the constitution of the country and its lawful establishments, this new oath required members of the military to obey Hitler even if they were being ordered to do something illegal. Hitler decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the Einsatzgruppen—the mobile death squads responsible for millions of murders in Eastern Europe—when it was tactically possible to do so. Wehrmacht troops also participated directly in the Holocaust by shooting civilians or committing genocide under the guise of anti-partisan operations. The party line was that the Jews were the instigators of the partisan struggle and therefore needed to be eliminated. On 8 July 1941, Heydrich announced that all Jews in the eastern conquered territories were to be regarded as partisans and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. By August, this was extended to include the entire Jewish population.In spite of efforts to prepare the country militarily, the economy could not sustain a lengthy war of attrition. A strategy was developed based on the tactic of Blitzkrieg (\"lightning war\"), which involved using quick coordinated assaults that avoided enemy strong points. Attacks began with artillery bombardment, followed by bombing and strafing runs. Next the tanks would attack and finally the infantry would move in to secure the captured area. Victories continued through mid-1940, but the failure to defeat Britain was the first major turning point in the war. The decision to attack the Soviet Union and the decisive defeat at Stalingrad led to the retreat of the German armies and the eventual loss of the war. The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1945 was around 18.2 million, of whom 5.3 million died.\n\n=== The SA and SS ===\nThe Sturmabteilung (SA; Storm Detachment), or Brownshirts, founded in 1921, was the first paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party; their initial assignment was to protect Nazi leaders at rallies and assemblies. They also took part in street battles against the forces of rival political parties and violent actions against Jews and others. Under Ernst Röhm's leadership the SA grew by 1934 to over half a million members—4.5 million including reserves—at a time when the regular army was still limited to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty.Röhm hoped to assume command of the army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA. Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg threatened to impose martial law if the activities of the SA were not curtailed. Therefore, less than a year and a half after seizing power, Hitler ordered the deaths of the SA leadership, including Rohm. After the purge of 1934, the SA was no longer a major force.Initially a small bodyguard unit under the auspices of the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS; Protection Squadron) grew to become one of the largest and most powerful groups in Nazi Germany. Led by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million members by 1938. Himmler initially envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, evolved into a second army. It was dependent on the regular army for heavy weaponry and equipment, and most units were under tactical control of the High Command of the Armed Forces (OKW). By the end of 1942, the stringent selection and racial requirements that had initially been in place were no longer followed. With recruitment and conscription based only on expansion, by 1943 the Waffen-SS could not longer claim to be an elite fighting force.SS formations committed many war crimes against civilians and allied servicemen. From 1935 onward, the SS spearheaded the persecution of Jews, who were rounded up into ghettos and concentration camps. With the outbreak of World War II, the SS Einsatzgruppen units followed the army into Poland and the Soviet Union, where from 1941 to 1945 they murdered more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. A third of the Einsatzgruppen members were recruited from Waffen-SS personnel. The SS-Totenkopfverbände (death's head units) ran the concentration camps and extermination camps, where millions more were murdered. Up to 60,000 Waffen-SS men served in the camps.In 1931, Himmler organised an SS intelligence service which became known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) under his deputy, Heydrich. This organisation was tasked with locating and arresting communists and other political opponents. Himmler established the beginnings of a parallel economy under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office. This holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Reich economics ===\nThe most pressing economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 per cent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created a scheme for deficit financing in May 1933. Capital projects were paid for with the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money. Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the soaring national debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression. Economic recovery was uneven, with reduced hours of work and erratic availability of necessities, leading to disenchantment with the regime as early as 1934.In October 1933, the Junkers Aircraft Works was expropriated. In concert with other aircraft manufacturers and under the direction of Aviation Minister Göring, production was ramped up. From a workforce of 3,200 people producing 100 units per year in 1932, the industry grew to employ a quarter of a million workers manufacturing over 10,000 technically advanced aircraft annually less than ten years later.An elaborate bureaucracy was created to regulate imports of raw materials and finished goods with the intention of eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 per cent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as excess profits were by then being generated. In another attempt to secure an adequate wartime supply of petroleum, Germany intimidated Romania into signing a trade agreement in March 1939.\nMajor public works projects financed with deficit spending included the construction of a network of Autobahnen and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry, and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 per cent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed outside the home was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.Envisioning widespread car ownership as part of the new Germany, Hitler arranged for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that everyone could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. None were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).\nSix million people were unemployed when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million. This was in part due to the removal of women from the workforce. Real wages dropped by 25 per cent between 1933 and 1938. After the dissolution of the trade unions in May 1933, their funds were seized and their leadership arrested, including those who attempted to co-operate with the Nazis. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under Nazi Party functionary Robert Ley. The average work week was 43 hours in 1933; by 1939 this increased to 47 hours.By early 1934, the focus shifted towards rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 per cent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended to speed up rearmament. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants, and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. Plans unveiled in late 1938 for massive increases to the navy and air force were impossible to fulfil, as Germany lacked the finances and material resources to build the planned units, as well as the necessary fuel required to keep them running. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.\n\n=== Wartime economy and forced labour ===\nThe Nazi war economy was a mixed economy that combined a free market with central planning. Historian Richard Overy describes it as being somewhere in between the command economy of the Soviet Union and the capitalist system of the United States.In 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister Fritz Todt, Hitler appointed Albert Speer as his replacement. Wartime rationing of consumer goods led to an increase in personal savings, funds which were in turn lent to the government to support the war effort. By 1944, the war was consuming 75 per cent of Germany's gross domestic product, compared to 60 per cent in the Soviet Union and 55 per cent in Britain. Speer improved production by centralising planning and control, reducing production of consumer goods, and using forced labour and slavery. The wartime economy eventually relied heavily upon the large-scale employment of slave labour. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries to work in factories and on farms. Approximately 75 per cent were Eastern European. Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection. Poor living conditions led to high rates of sickness, injury, and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity. The wartime economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by plundering the resources of occupied territories.Foreign workers brought into Germany were put into four classifications: guest workers, military internees, civilian workers, and Eastern workers. Each group was subject to different regulations. The Nazis issued a ban on sexual relations between Germans and foreign workers.By 1944, over a half million women served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces. The number of women in paid employment only increased by 271,000 (1.8 per cent) from 1939 to 1944. As the production of consumer goods had been cut back, women left those industries for employment in the war economy. They also took jobs formerly held by men, especially on farms and in family-owned shops.Very heavy strategic bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing synthetic oil and gasoline, as well as the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible. Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.\n\n=== Financial exploitation of conquered territories ===\nDuring the course of the war, the Nazis extracted considerable plunder from occupied Europe. Historian and war correspondent William L. Shirer writes: \"The total amount of [Nazi] loot will never be known; it has proved beyond man's capacity to accurately compute.\" Gold reserves and other foreign holdings were seized from the national banks of occupied nations, while large \"occupation costs\" were usually imposed. By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60 billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5 billion. The Bank of France was forced to provide 4.5 billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey concluded Germany had obtained 104 billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the gross domestic product of Belgium and the Netherlands.Nazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions. Hitler and Göring in particular were interested in acquiring looted art treasures from occupied Europe, the former planning to use the stolen art to fill the galleries of the planned Führermuseum (Leader's Museum), and the latter for his personal collection. Göring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50 million Reichsmarks. In 1940, the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France. By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks. In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing—items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany—for shipment home.Goods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated 9,000,000 tonnes (8,900,000 long tons; 9,900,000 short tons) of cereals were seized during the course of the war, including 75 per cent of its oats. In addition, 80 per cent of the country's oil and 74 per cent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5 billion francs. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.Following Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, 2,000,000 tonnes (2,000,000 long tons; 2,200,000 short tons) of fodder, 3,000,000 tonnes (3,000,000 long tons; 3,300,000 short tons) of potatoes, and 662,000 tonnes (652,000 long tons; 730,000 short tons) of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12 million pigs and 13 million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4 billion Reichsmarks. This relatively low number in comparison to the occupied nations of Western Europe can be attributed to the devastating fighting on the Eastern Front.\n\n== Racial policy and eugenics ==\n\n=== Racism and antisemitism ===\nRacism and antisemitism were basic tenets of the Nazi Party and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief in the existence of a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.\n\n=== Persecution of Jews ===\nDiscrimination against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power. Following a month-long series of attacks by members of the SA on Jewish businesses and synagogues, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived other Jewish professionals of their right to practise, and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan. As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist German Students' League removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.The regime used violence and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily. Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks. Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.On 7 November 1938 a young Jewish man, Herschel Grynszpan, shot and killed Ernst vom Rath, a legation secretary at the German embassy in Paris, to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the Nazis incited against the Jews two days later. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were murdered during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months – they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library, or own weapons, and Jewish pupils were removed from schools. The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any insurance settlements would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine, and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there under the terms of the Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind, and it was seized by the government.\n\n=== Persecution of Roma ===\nLike the Jews, the Romani people were subjected to persecution from the early days of the regime. The Romani were forbidden to marry people of German extraction. They were shipped to concentration camps starting in 1935 and many were murdered. Following the invasion of Poland, 2,500 Roma and Sinti people were deported from Germany to the General Government, where they were imprisoned in labour camps. The survivors were likely exterminated at Bełżec, Sobibor, or Treblinka. A further 5,000 Sinti and Austrian Lalleri people were deported to the Łódź Ghetto in late 1941, where half were estimated to have died. The Romani survivors of the ghetto were subsequently moved to the Chełmno extermination camp in early 1942.The Nazis intended on deporting all Romani people from Germany, and confined them to Zigeunerlager (Gypsy camps) for this purpose. Himmler ordered their deportation from Germany in December 1942, with few exceptions. A total of 23,000 Romani were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, of whom 19,000 died. Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were murdered outright. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were murdered by the SS, the German Army, and Einsatzgruppen. In occupied Serbia, 1,000 to 12,000 Romani were murdered, while nearly all 25,000 Romani living in the Independent State of Croatia were murdered. The estimates at end of the war put the total number of Romani victims at around 220,000, which equalled approximately 25 per cent of the Romani population in Europe.\n\n=== Other persecuted groups ===\nAction T4 was a programme of systematic murder of the physically and mentally handicapped and patients in psychiatric hospitals that took place mainly from 1939 to 1941, and continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the Einsatzgruppen and others; gas chambers and gas vans using carbon monoxide were used by early 1940. Under the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, enacted on 14 July 1933, over 400,000 individuals underwent compulsory sterilisation. Over half were those considered mentally deficient, which included not only people who scored poorly on intelligence tests, but those who deviated from expected standards of behaviour regarding thrift, sexual behaviour, and cleanliness. Most of the victims came from disadvantaged groups such as prostitutes, the poor, the homeless, and criminals. Other groups persecuted and murdered included Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, social misfits, and members of the political and religious opposition.\n\n=== Generalplan Ost ===\nGermany's war in the East was based on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused his attention on Eastern Europe, aiming to conquer Poland and the Soviet Union. After the occupation of Poland in 1939, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos, and those who were physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour. In 1941 Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely; within 15 to 20 years the General Government was to be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists. About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves, part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations.The Generalplan Ost (\"General Plan for the East\") called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered. To determine who should be killed, Himmler created the Volksliste, a system of classification of people deemed to be of German blood. He ordered that those of Germanic descent who refused to be classified as ethnic Germans should be deported to concentration camps, have their children taken away, or be assigned to forced labour. The plan also included the kidnapping of children deemed to have Aryan-Nordic traits, who were presumed to be of German descent. The goal was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the invasion failed Hitler had to consider other options. One suggestion was a mass forced deportation of Jews to Poland, Palestine, or Madagascar.In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union. These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) throughout the USSR and elsewhere in Europe. During the course of the war, the Soviet Union lost a total of 27 million people; less than nine million of these were combat deaths. One in four of the Soviet population were killed or wounded.\n\n=== The Holocaust and Final Solution ===\nAround the time of the failed offensive against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately. While the murder of Jewish civilians had been ongoing in the occupied territories of Poland and the Soviet Union, plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be murdered in the implementation of the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. Initially the victims were murdered by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, then by stationary gas chambers or by gas vans, but these methods proved impractical for an operation of this scale. By 1942 extermination camps equipped with gas chambers were established at Auschwitz, Chełmno, Sobibor, Treblinka, and elsewhere. The total number of Jews murdered is estimated at 5.5 to six million, including over a million children.The Allies received information about the murders from the Polish government-in-exile and Polish leadership in Warsaw, based mostly on intelligence from the Polish underground. German citizens had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from the occupied territories reported on what they had seen and done. Historian Richard J. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide.\n\n=== Oppression of ethnic Poles ===\nPoles were viewed by Nazis as subhuman non-Aryans, and during the German occupation of Poland 2.7 million ethnic Poles died. Polish civilians were subject to forced labour in German industry, internment, wholesale expulsions to make way for German colonists, and mass executions. The German authorities engaged in a systematic effort to destroy Polish culture and national identity. During operation AB-Aktion, many university professors and members of the Polish intelligentsia were arrested, transported to concentration camps, or executed. During the war, Poland lost an estimated 39 to 45 per cent of its physicians and dentists, 26 to 57 per cent of its lawyers, 15 to 30 per cent of its teachers, 30 to 40 per cent of its scientists and university professors, and 18 to 28 per cent of its clergy.\n\n=== Mistreatment of Soviet POWs ===\nThe Nazis captured 5.75 million Soviet prisoners of war, more than they took from all the other Allied powers combined. Of these, they killed an estimated 3.3 million, with 2.8 million of them being killed between June 1941 and January 1942. Many POWs starved to death or resorted to cannibalism while being held in open-air pens at Auschwitz and elsewhere.From 1942 onward, Soviet POWs were viewed as a source of forced labour, and received better treatment so they could work. By December 1944, 750,000 Soviet POWs were working, including in German armaments factories (in violation of the Hague and Geneva conventions), mines, and farms.\n\n== Society ==\n\n=== Education ===\nAntisemitic legislation passed in 1933 led to the removal of all Jewish teachers, professors, and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required to belong to the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (NSLB; National Socialist Teachers League) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler, and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession. The average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.Frequent and often contradictory directives were issued by Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, and other agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools. Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries. Indoctrination in Nazi ideology was made compulsory in January 1934. Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated from the age of 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.\nPrimary and secondary education focused on racial biology, population policy, culture, geography, and physical fitness. The curriculum in most subjects, including biology, geography, and even arithmetic, was altered to change the focus to race. Military education became the central component of physical education, and education in physics was oriented toward subjects with military applications, such as ballistics and aerodynamics. Students were required to watch all films prepared by the school division of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.At universities, appointments to top posts were the subject of power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards, and the National Socialist German Students' League. In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period. This was especially true of universities located in predominantly Catholic regions. Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors had been forced to leave the profession, so medical graduates had good job prospects. From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA. First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reich Labour Service; an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.\n\n=== Role of women and family ===\nWomen were a cornerstone of Nazi social policy. The Nazis opposed the feminist movement, claiming that it was the creation of Jewish intellectuals, instead advocating a patriarchal society in which the German woman would recognise that her \"world is her husband, her family, her children, and her home\". Feminist groups were shut down or incorporated into the National Socialist Women's League, which coordinated groups throughout the country to promote motherhood and household activities. Courses were offered on childrearing, sewing, and cooking. Prominent feminists, including Anita Augspurg, Lida Gustava Heymann, and Helene Stöcker, felt forced to live in exile. The League published the NS-Frauen-Warte, the only Nazi-approved women's magazine in Nazi Germany; despite some propaganda aspects, it was predominantly an ordinary woman's magazine.Women were encouraged to leave the workforce, and the creation of large families by racially suitable women was promoted through a propaganda campaign. Women received a bronze award—known as the Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter (Cross of Honour of the German Mother)—for giving birth to four children, silver for six, and gold for eight or more. Large families received subsidies to help with expenses. Though the measures led to increases in the birth rate, the number of families having four or more children declined by five per cent between 1935 and 1940. Removing women from the workforce did not have the intended effect of freeing up jobs for men, as women were for the most part employed as domestic servants, weavers, or in the food and drink industries—jobs that were not of interest to men. Nazi philosophy prevented large numbers of women from being hired to work in munitions factories in the build-up to the war, so foreign labourers were brought in. After the war started, slave labourers were extensively used. In January 1943, Hitler signed a decree requiring all women under the age of fifty to report for work assignments to help the war effort. Thereafter women were funnelled into agricultural and industrial jobs, and by September 1944 14.9 million women were working in munitions production.Nazi leaders endorsed the idea that rational and theoretical work was alien to a woman's nature, and as such discouraged women from seeking higher education. A law passed in April 1933 limited the number of females admitted to university to ten per cent of the number of male attendees. This resulted in female enrolment in secondary schools dropping from 437,000 in 1926 to 205,000 in 1937. The number of women enrolled in post-secondary schools dropped from 128,000 in 1933 to 51,000 in 1938. However, with the requirement that men be enlisted into the armed forces during the war, women comprised half of the enrolment in the post-secondary system by 1944.\nWomen were expected to be strong, healthy, and vital. The sturdy peasant woman who worked the land and bore strong children was considered ideal, and women were praised for being athletic and tanned from working outdoors. Organisations were created for the indoctrination of Nazi values. From 25 March 1939 membership in the Hitler Youth was made compulsory for all children over the age of ten. The Jungmädelbund (Young Girls League) section of the Hitler Youth was for girls age 10 to 14 and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM; League of German Girls) was for young women age 14 to 18. The BDM's activities focused on physical education, with activities such as running, long jumping, somersaulting, tightrope walking, marching, and swimming.The Nazi regime promoted a liberal code of conduct regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. Soldier's wives were frequently involved in extramarital relationships. Sex was sometimes used as a commodity to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.With Hitler's approval, Himmler intended that the new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered by members of the SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes to accommodate single mothers during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and Nazi Party members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.Existing laws banning abortion except for medical reasons were strictly enforced by the Nazi regime. The number of abortions declined from 35,000 per year at the start of the 1930s to fewer than 2,000 per year at the end of the decade, though in 1935 a law was passed allowing abortions for eugenics reasons.\n\n=== Health ===\nNazi Germany had a strong anti-tobacco movement, as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains, and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As part of a general public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products, and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.Government-run health care insurance plans were available, but Jews were denied coverage starting in 1933. That same year, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat government-insured patients. In 1937, Jewish doctors were forbidden to treat non-Jewish patients, and in 1938 their right to practice medicine was removed entirely.Medical experiments, many of them pseudoscientific, were performed on concentration camp inmates beginning in 1941. The most notorious doctor to perform medical experiments was SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. Josef Mengele, camp doctor at Auschwitz. Many of his victims died. Concentration camp inmates were made available for purchase by pharmaceutical companies for drug testing and other experiments.\n\n=== Environmentalism ===\nNazi society had elements supportive of animal rights and many people were fond of zoos and wildlife. The government took several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. The law was only loosely enforced, and in spite of a ban on vivisection, the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.The Reich Forestry Office under Göring enforced regulations that required foresters to plant a variety of trees to ensure suitable habitat for wildlife, and a new Reich Animal Protection Act became law in 1933. The regime enacted the Reich Nature Protection Act in 1935 to protect the natural landscape from excessive economic development. It allowed for the expropriation of privately owned land to create nature preserves and aided in long-range planning. Perfunctory efforts were made to curb air pollution, but little enforcement of existing legislation was undertaken once the war began.\n\n=== Religion ===\nWhen the Nazis seized power in 1933, roughly 67 per cent of the population of Germany was Protestant, 33 per cent was Roman Catholic, while Jews made up less than 1 per cent. According to 1939 census, 54 per cent considered themselves Protestant, 40 per cent Roman Catholic, 3.5 per cent Gottgläubig (God-believing; a Nazi religious movement) and 1.5 per cent nonreligious. Nazi Germany extensively employed Christian imagery and instituted a variety of new Christian holidays and celebrations, such as a massive celebration marking the 1200th anniversary of the birth of Frankish emperor Charlemagne, who Christianized neighbouring continental Germanic peoples by force during the Saxon Wars. Nazi propaganda stylised Hitler as a Christ-like messiah, a \"figure of redemption according to the Christian model\", \"who would liberate the world from the Antichrist\".Under the Gleichschaltung process, Hitler attempted to create a unified Protestant Reich Church from Germany's 28 existing Protestant state churches. Pro-Nazi Ludwig Müller was installed as Reich Bishop and the pro-Nazi pressure group German Christians gained control of the new church. They objected to the Old Testament because of its Jewish origins and demanded that converted Jews be barred from their church. Pastor Martin Niemöller responded with the formation of the Confessing Church, from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime. When in 1935 the Confessing Church synod protested the Nazi policy on religion, 700 of their pastors were arrested. Müller resigned and Hitler appointed Hanns Kerrl as Minister for Church Affairs to continue efforts to control Protestantism. In 1936, a Confessing Church envoy protested to Hitler against the religious persecutions and human rights abuses. Hundreds more pastors were arrested. The church continued to resist and by early 1937 Hitler abandoned his hope of uniting the Protestant churches. Niemöller was arrested on 1 July 1937 and spent most of the next seven years in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Dachau. Theological universities were closed and pastors and theologians of other Protestant denominations were also arrested.\nPersecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment of the church in Germany. The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several Catholic leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.Pope Pius XI had the \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (\"With Burning Concern\") encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit as it denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church. In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. Enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Later Catholic protests included the 22 March 1942 pastoral letter by the German bishops on \"The Struggle against Christianity and the Church\". About 30 per cent of Catholic priests were disciplined by police during the Nazi era. A vast security network spied on the activities of clergy and priests were frequently denounced, arrested or sent to concentration camps – many to the dedicated clergy barracks at Dachau. In the areas of Poland annexed in 1939, the Nazis instigated a brutal suppression and systematic dismantling of the Catholic Church.Alfred Rosenberg, head of the Nazi Party Office of Foreign Affairs and Hitler's appointed cultural and educational leader for Nazi Germany, considered Catholicism to be among the Nazis' chief enemies. He planned the \"extermination of the foreign Christian faiths imported into Germany\", and for the Bible and Christian cross to be replaced in all churches, cathedrals, and chapels with copies of Mein Kampf and the swastika. Other sects of Christianity were also targeted, with Chief of the Nazi Party Chancellery Martin Bormann publicly proclaiming in 1941, \"National Socialism and Christianity are irreconcilable.\"\n\n=== Resistance to the regime ===\nWhile no unified resistance movement opposing the Nazi regime existed, acts of defiance such as sabotage and labour slowdowns took place, as well as attempts to overthrow the regime or assassinate Hitler. The banned Communist and Social Democratic parties set up resistance networks in the mid-1930s. These networks achieved little beyond fomenting unrest and initiating short-lived strikes. Carl Friedrich Goerdeller, who initially supported Hitler, changed his mind in 1936 and was later a participant in the July 20 plot. The Red Orchestra spy ring provided information to the Allies about Nazi war crimes, helped orchestrate escapes from Germany, and distributed leaflets. The group was detected by the Gestapo and more than 50 members were tried and executed in 1942. Communist and Social Democratic resistance groups resumed activity in late 1942, but were unable to achieve much beyond distributing leaflets. The two groups saw themselves as potential rival parties in post-war Germany, and for the most part did not co-ordinate their activities. The White Rose resistance group was primarily active in 1942–43, and many of its members were arrested or executed, with the final arrests taking place in 1944. Another civilian resistance group, the Kreisau Circle, had some connections with the military conspirators, and many of its members were arrested after the failed 20 July plot.While civilian efforts had an impact on public opinion, the army was the only organisation with the capacity to overthrow the government. A major plot by men in the upper echelons of the military originated in 1938. They believed Britain would go to war over Hitler's planned invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Germany would lose. The plan was to overthrow Hitler or possibly assassinate him. Participants included Generaloberst Ludwig Beck, Generaloberst Walther von Brauchitsch, Generaloberst Franz Halder, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and Generalleutnant Erwin von Witzleben, who joined a conspiracy headed by Oberstleutnant Hans Oster and Major Helmuth Groscurth of the Abwehr. The planned coup was cancelled after the signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Many of the same people were involved in a coup planned for 1940, but again the participants changed their minds and backed down, partly because of the popularity of the regime after the early victories in the war. Attempts to assassinate Hitler resumed in earnest in 1943, with Henning von Tresckow joining Oster's group and attempting to blow up Hitler's plane in 1943. Several more attempts followed before the failed 20 July 1944 plot, which was at least partly motivated by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. The plot, part of Operation Valkyrie, involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in the conference room at Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler, who narrowly survived, later ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900 people.Around 1940 a resistance group formed around the priest Heinrich Maier. The group passed on locations of production facilities for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks, and aircraft to the Allies from late 1943 onwards. Allied bombers used this information to carry out air attacks. The Maier group provided information about the mass murder of Jews very early on; these reports were not initially believed by the Allies. The resistance group was uncovered and most of its members were imprisoned, tortured, or killed.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe regime promoted the concept of Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. As well as taking control of tens of thousands of privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was organised under the control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts, and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to be approved by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.Radio became popular in Germany during the 1930s; over 70 per cent of households owned a receiver by 1939, more than any other country. By July 1933, radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable. Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.\n\n=== Censorship ===\nNewspapers, like other media, were controlled by the state; the Reich Press Chamber shut down or bought newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over two-thirds of the newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The Nazi Party daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter (\"Ethnic Observer\"), was edited by Rosenberg, who also wrote The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. Under Goebbels, the Propaganda Ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely, especially regarding what to omit. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio. Propaganda became less effective towards the end of the war, as people were able to obtain information outside of official channels.Authors of books left the country in droves and some wrote material critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of blood and soil. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime. Nazi book burnings took place; nineteen such events were held on the night of 10 May 1933. Tens of thousands of books from dozens of figures, including Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Helen Keller, Alfred Kerr, Marcel Proust, Erich Maria Remarque, Upton Sinclair, Jakob Wassermann, H. G. Wells, and Émile Zola were publicly burned. Pacifist works, and literature espousing liberal, democratic values were targeted for destruction, as well as any writings supporting the Weimar Republic or those written by Jewish authors.\n\n=== Architecture and art ===\nHitler took a personal interest in architecture and worked closely with state architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture. Speer constructed imposing structures such as the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and a new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin. Hitler's plans for rebuilding Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the Pantheon in Rome and a triumphal arch more than double the height of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Neither structure was built.Hitler's belief that abstract, Dadaist, expressionist and modern art were decadent became the basis for policy. Many art museum directors lost their posts in 1933 and were replaced by party members. Some 6,500 modern works of art were removed from museums and replaced with works chosen by a Nazi jury. Exhibitions of the rejected pieces, under titles such as \"Decadence in Art\", were launched in sixteen different cities by 1935. The Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.Composer Richard Strauss was appointed president of the Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. As was the case with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable and for the most part disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories, and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933 to 1942.\n\n=== Film ===\nMovies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over a billion people in 1942, 1943 and 1944. By 1934, German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for US film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, Universum Film AG and Tobis, were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content. Scripts were pre-censored.Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New techniques such as telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of Nazi ideals.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Allied powers organised war crimes trials, beginning with the Nuremberg trials, held from November 1945 to October 1946, of 23 top Nazi officials. They were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity—in violation of international laws governing warfare. All but three of the defendants were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death. Twelve subsequent Nuremberg trials of 184 defendants were held between 1946 and 1949. Between 1946 and 1949, the Allies investigated 3,887 cases, of which 489 were brought to trial. The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 per cent of the death sentences were carried out. Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.The political programme espoused by Hitler and the Nazis brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe. Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour). The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare. As a result, Nazi ideology and the actions taken by the regime are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral. Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word \"evil\" to describe Hitler and the Nazi regime. Interest in Nazi Germany continues in the media and the academic world. While Evans remarks that the era \"exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity\", young neo-Nazis enjoy the shock value that Nazi symbols or slogans provide. The display or use of Nazi symbolism such as flags, swastikas, or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria.Nazi Germany was succeeded by three states: West Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany or \"FRG\"), East Germany (the German Democratic Republic or \"GRD\"), and Austria.\nThe process of denazification, which was initiated by the Allies as a way to remove Nazi Party members was only partially successful, as the need for experts in such fields as medicine and engineering was too great. However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs. From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.The trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries Holocaust in 1979 brought the process of Vergangenheitsbewältigung (coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has led to the development of a strong democracy in Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.In 2017, a Körber Foundation survey found that just 47 per cent of 14 to 16-year-olds in Germany knew what Auschwitz was. The journalist Alan Posener attributed the country's \"growing historical amnesia\" in part to a failure by the German film and television industry to reflect the country's history accurately.\n\n\n'Alawi dynasty, 18th-century history of Germany, 1934 German referendum, 1934 Montreux Fascist conference, 1936 Summer Olympics, 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, 1939–1940 Winter Offensive, 1944 Bulgarian coup d'état, 1944 Romanian coup d'état, 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, 20 July plot, 28 May 1926 coup d'état, 2nd Belorussian Front, 4th of August Regime, 6th Army (Wehrmacht), A.

      "text": "John Pierpont Morgan Sr. (April 17, 1837 – March 31, 1913) was an American financier and investment banker who dominated corporate finance on Wall Street throughout the Gilded Age. As the head of the banking firm that ultimately became known as J.P. Morgan and Co., he was the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the United States spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nOver the course of his career on Wall Street, J.P. Morgan spearheaded the formation of several prominent multinational corporations including U.S. Steel, International Harvester and General Electric which subsequently fell under his supervision. He and his partners also held controlling interests in numerous other American businesses including Aetna, Western Union, Pullman Car Company and 21 railroads. Due to the extent of his dominance over U.S. finance, Morgan exercised enormous influence over the nation's policies and the market forces underlying its economy. During the Panic of 1907, he organized a coalition of financiers that saved the American monetary system from collapse.\nAs the Progressive Era's leading financier, J.P. Morgan's dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform the shape of the American economy. Adrian Wooldridge characterized Morgan as America's \"greatest banker\". Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan Jr. Biographer Ron Chernow estimated his fortune at $80 million (equivalent to $2.2 billion in 2021).",

      "text": "Ancient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100 BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.\nThe gods' complex characteristics were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities: family ties, loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in art—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features.\nIn different eras, various gods were said to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited with the creation of the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was present in all the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on an abstract solar deity, the Aten.\nGods were assumed to be present throughout the world, capable of influencing natural events and the course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons as well as for larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE16 Major, Committee, Wiktionary, Roles Embalmer, Eleventh Edition, Hades, Ancient Deities, London, Hermes, Riggs, Darengo Publications, Hermes Part, Isis, caninesMythological, Freeman, Ancient Egyptian Conceptions, Leonard, John, Classical Journal, Socratic Oath, Ammit, Souls, Guardian, Parents Nepthys, George Hart, Legacy, Hesat, Rena M., Kings, Vatican Museums, Main, Sarah Iles, Egyptian, Italy, Lapp, Bibliography Armour, Gorgias, Inpw, Donate Contribute Help Learn, Robert G., Duquesne, Wikimedia Commons Languages Deutsch Español Français, Helgen, Rome, Pompeii, McFarland, University, Brill Archive, Lintel, Terence, Encyclopedia, Coptic Anoup, Zabern, Current Biology, Gods, Religious Aspects, Faulkner, Tell Amarna Tablets, Dendera, Distinct Species, Golden Ass, Yurchenko, Museum Explorer, Claude Reignier, Amarna, New Kingdom, Oxford History, Italiano Русский Tagalog Tiếng Việt 中文 Edit, Tutankhamun, Hendricks, Wikimedia Foundation, Koepfli, Olaf, Goddess Nephthys, Rhein, Jacqueline, Middle, Harpocrates, Republic, Berücksichtigung, Text, Name, Shapiro, Jennifer, A7N6PJCAF5Q Further, S2CID, Ronald J, Anubis Shrine, Cynopolis, Upwawet, Jnpw, Especially, Cynopolis Symbol, Egyptian Archaeology, Animal, Jefferson, Mountain, Developers Statistics Cookie, Cambridge, Death, West, Oxford University, Russell, Collegiate Dictionary, Hunefer, Art Recumbent Anubis, Locations Symbols, Sirius, Robert A, Old Kingdom, Tivoli, Blackwood, Seth, Cerberus, Old Kingdom Cemetery, Palestine Exploration Fund, Barker, East, Dobrynin, ISBN, Peacock, Blaire, Andrews, Alexey, Texts Related, History, Hermanubis, Medical, Funerary Religion, Patricia, American University, Grenier, Greek, Ancient, Contents, Sabah, Secrets, Metropolitan Museum, Watt, Mandaean, Vatican City, Beautiful Burial, Horus Beliefs Practices Deities, Saqqara, Francisco, George, Italy Anubis, Navigation, Westerners, Kinsley, Roman Period, Valley, Egypt, Hellenistic, Eurasian, Lévai, Nile River, Inpu, Newer, Stela, Complete Gods, Crossett, James, Random, Journal, Pavel, Ryszard W., New York Press, Brito, Cahill, hybridsPsychopompsUnderworld, Greek Plutarch, Sankt Petersburg, Jessica, Renaissance, José C., Oxford University Press, Article, Egyptians, Art Anubis, Wikipedia Disclaimers Contact Wikipedia Mobile, Second, Underworld, Search Main, Sarah, Mummification, Leprohon, GGKEY, Wasserman, Akkadian, British, Cairo, Godinho, Babylon, Book, Herbert, Price, Raquel, Die Opferformel, Richard H., Wikimedia Commons, Ptolemaic, Community, Horemheb, Intermediate Period, Qubbet, Anubis, Nine Bows, River Nile, Ancient Egyptian, Romans, French, Abatur, Johnston, Mainz, Hades Anput Bhairava, Identity, Myths, Charles Russell, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Wikimedia Foundation Powered, godsWolves, Abdel Razek, Greeks, New York, Raymond O., Nubia, Pocket Museum, Oxford, History Anubis, Portrayal, Shaw, Scales, Abydos, Pedro, Hall, Museum, Anpu, Wilkinson, Embalming, Turner, Ramesses, Anubis Anubis, Geffen, Privacy Policy, Swallows Millions, Van Valkenburgh, Talk, Wikipedia Contact, New York City, Anubias Egyptian, Fourth Dynasty, Robinson, Gallery Lintel, Middle Kingdom, Middle Ages, Schweizer, Beth, Carol, Art Statuette, Organon, Silva, Jump, Wayne, Divine Booth, Hart, Alten Reiches, Wepwawet Consort Anput, Anput, Sacred Mountain, Goddesses, Upper Egypt, Toby A., Prince, Andrey, James A., Jackal Divinities, Millennium B.

      "text": "\nOsiris and the Four Sons of Horus\nOsiris and the Four Sons of Horus\n\nOsiris, also called Usir, one of the most important gods of ancient Egypt. The origin of Osiris is obscure; he was a local god of Busiris, in Lower Egypt, and may have been a personification of chthonic (underworld) fertility. By about 2400 bce, however, Osiris clearly played a double role: he was both a god of fertility and the embodiment of the dead and resurrected king. This dual role was in turn combined with the Egyptian concept of divine kingship: the king at death became Osiris, god of the underworld; and the dead king’s son, the living king, was identified with Horus, a god of the sky. Osiris and Horus were thus father and son. The goddess Isis was the mother of the king and was thus the mother of Horus and consort of Osiris. The god Seth was considered the murderer of Osiris and adversary of Horus.\n\nAccording to the form of the myth reported by the Greek author Plutarch, Osiris was slain or drowned by Seth, who tore the corpse into 14 pieces and flung them over Egypt. Eventually, Isis and her sister Nephthys found and buried all the pieces, except the phallus, thereby giving new life to Osiris, who thenceforth remained in the underworld as ruler and judge. His son Horus successfully fought against Seth, avenging Osiris and becoming the new king of Egypt.\nPaul Bunyan: The Tale of a Lumberjack\nBritannica Quiz\nMythology, Legend, and Folklore\nAccording to American folklore, who dug out the Grand Canyon? From Egyptian gods to Norse heroes, dig out the facts in this quiz of mythology, legend, and folklore.\n\nOsiris was not only ruler of the dead but also the power that granted all life from the underworld, from sprouting vegetation to the annual flood of the Nile River. From about 2000 bce onward it was believed that every man, not just the deceased kings, became associated with Osiris at death. This identification with Osiris, however, did not imply resurrection, for even Osiris did not rise from the dead. Instead, it signified the renewal of life both in the next world and through one’s descendants on Earth. In this universalized form Osiris’s cult spread throughout Egypt, often joining with the cults of local fertility and underworld deities.\n\nThe idea that rebirth in the next life could be gained by following Osiris was maintained through certain cult forms. In the Middle Kingdom (1938–c. 1630 bce) the god’s festivals consisted of processions and nocturnal rites and were celebrated at the temple of Abydos, where Osiris had assimilated the very ancient god of the dead, Khenty-Imentiu. This name, meaning “Foremost of the Westerners,” was adopted by Osiris as an epithet. Because the festivals took place in the open, public participation was permitted, and by the early 2nd millennium bce it had become fashionable to be buried along the processional road at Abydos or to erect a cenotaph there as a representative of the dead.\nExplore the Osiris shaft, a symbolic tomb of the god Osiris\nExplore the Osiris shaft, a symbolic tomb of the god Osiris\nSee all videos for this article\n\nOsiris festivals symbolically reenacting the god’s fate were celebrated annually in various towns throughout Egypt. A central feature of the festivals during the late period was the construction of the “Osiris garden,” a mold in the shape of Osiris, filled with soil. The mold was moistened with the water of the Nile and sown with grain. Later, the sprouting grain symbolized the vital strength of Osiris.\n\nAt Memphis the holy bull, Apis, was linked with Osiris, becoming Osiris-Apis, which eventually became the name of the Hellenistic god Serapis. Greco-Roman authors connected Osiris with the god Dionysus. Osiris was also identified with Soker, an ancient Memphite god of the dead.",

      "text": "Memphis, city and capital of ancient Egypt and an important centre during much of Egyptian history. Memphis is located south of the Nile River delta, on the west bank of the river, and about 15 miles (24 km) south of modern Cairo. Closely associated with the ancient city’s site are the cemeteries, or necropolises, of Memphis, where the famous pyramids of Egypt are located. From north to south the main pyramid fields are: Abū Ruwaysh, Giza, Zāwiyat al-ʿAryān, Abū Ṣīr, Ṣaqqārah, and Dahshūr. The Memphis archaeological zone was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.\nFoundation and Early Dynastic Period\n\nAccording to a commonly accepted tradition, Memphis was founded about 2925 bce by Menes, who supposedly united the two prehistoric kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt. The original name of the city was the White Walls, and the term may have referred originally to the king’s palace, which would have been built of whitewashed brick. The modern name of Memphis is a Greek version of the Egyptian Men-nefer, the name of the nearby pyramid of the 6th-dynasty (c. 2325–c. 2150 bce) king Pepi I. Another geographic term for Memphis, Hut-ka-Ptah (“mansion of the ka of Ptah”), rendered Aigyptos in Greek, was later applied to the country as a whole.\nPtah, holding the emblems of life and power, bronze statuette, Memphis, c. 600–100 bce; in the British Museum, London.\n\nPtah, the local god of Memphis, was a patron of craftsmen and artisans and, in some contexts, a creator god as well. The great temple of Ptah was one of the city’s most prominent structures. According to an Egyptian document known as the “Memphite Theology,” Ptah created humans through the power of his heart and speech; the concept, having been shaped in the heart of the creator, was brought into existence through the divine utterance itself. In its freedom from the conventional physical analogies of the creative act and in its degree of abstraction, this text is virtually unique in Egypt, and it testifies to the philosophical sophistication of the priests of Memphis.\n\nThe prominence of Memphis during the earliest periods is indicated by the extensive cemeteries of the Early Dynastic period (c. 2925–c. 2575 bce) and Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bce) that cluster along the desert bluffs to the west. Large elaborately niched tombs of the 1st and 2nd dynasties (c. 2925–c. 2650 bce) found at Ṣaqqārah, once argued to be royal monuments, were later accepted as private tombs of powerful courtiers.\nTemple ruins of columns and statures at Karnak, Egypt (Egyptian architecture; Egyptian archaelogy; Egyptian history)\nBritannica Quiz\nHistory Buff Quiz\nYou know basic history facts inside and out.

The 3rd-century-bce historian Manetho calls the 3rd and 4th dynasties (c. 2650–c. 2465 bce) Memphite, and the huge royal pyramid tombs of this period, in the necropolises of Memphis, confirm this. Djoser, the second king of the 3rd dynasty, was the builder of the Step Pyramid of Ṣaqqārah, the earliest royal foundation at Memphis and the first important stone building in Egypt. Imhotep, the king’s architect and adviser, is credited with this architectural feat; his reputation as a wise man and physician led in later times to his deification and his identification with the Greek god Asclepius.\nSide view of the Sphinx with the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) rising in the background at Giza, Egypt.\n\nThe remains of several unfinished or badly ruined pyramids near Memphis have been attributed to other 3rd-dynasty kings. The first king of the 4th dynasty, Snefru, built two pyramid tombs at Dahshūr. The three great pyramids of Giza belong to Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, later 4th-dynasty monarchs. The Great Sphinx at Giza dates from the time of Khafre. The last known king of this dynasty, Shepseskaf, built his tomb at South Ṣaqqārah. It was not a pyramid but a distinctive oblong structure with sloping sides, now called the Maṣṭabat Firʿawn.\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.\nSubscribe Now\n\nThe royal pyramids are surrounded by large cemeteries where the courtiers and officials who had served the king during his lifetime were buried. The beautiful reliefs in certain of these tombs include scenes of daily life and thus give some idea of the crafts, costumes, and occupations of the royal court of Memphis. Since little has survived of domestic architecture and household furnishings, these reliefs are a valuable source of information on such subjects. A notable exception to the general rule of loss and destruction is the hidden tomb of Queen Hetepheres, the mother of Khufu, which was discovered near the Great Pyramid of Giza. Though the queen’s body was unaccountably missing from her sarcophagus, her funerary equipment and furniture survived. The exquisite craftsmanship of these objects testify, as do the splendid low reliefs of the tombs, to the high development of the arts and crafts of the period. Indeed, it is believed by some scholars that the Old Kingdom, influenced by the craftsmen of the Memphite court and the philosopher-theologians of Ptah, reached a peak of “classic” culture that was never surpassed in Egypt.\n\nThe kings of the 5th dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 bce) moved south of Giza to build their funerary monuments; their pyramids, at Abū Ṣīr, are much smaller than those of the 4th dynasty, but the pyramid temples and causeways were decorated with fine reliefs. This dynasty was probably marked by a decline of Memphite influence paralleling the rise of a sun cult centred at Heliopolis. The major monuments of the period are not the pyramids but the sun temples, which were, however, also part of the so-called Memphite pyramid area, not far from Abū Ṣīr.\n\nDuring the 6th dynasty, which Manetho also designates as Memphite, the funerary monuments in the pyramid field of Ṣaqqārah continued to decline in size and workmanship. At that time the influence of the centralized government at Memphis began to wane, as is indicated by the increased prominence of provincial cities and the number of fine tombs located away from the Memphis area. This process of decentralization ended in the First Intermediate Period, a time of internal breakdown. Manetho’s 7th and 8th dynasties (c. 2150–c. 2130 bce) are both called Memphite, but it is believed that both dynasties together comprised a very short period and that the old Memphite house lost its control over the provincial princes soon after the end of the 6th dynasty.\nLater history\n\nMemphite influence continued during the Middle Kingdom (1938–c. 1630 bce), when Egypt was once more reunited, with the official residence of the 12th dynasty (1938–c. 1756) at nearby Itj-tawy (near modern Al-Lisht), near the entrance to Al-Fayyūm. Several 12th-dynasty monarchs erected pyramids at Dahshūr, the southernmost of the Memphite pyramid fields, but the majority of Middle Kingdom monuments were located nearer to Al-Lisht. Yet the predominant artistic and administrative influences during this period seem to be Memphite, and virtually every 12th-dynasty ruler added to the great temple of Ptah.\n\nAnother period of political and social chaos followed the 13th dynasty. This Second Intermediate Period (c. 1630–1540 bce) is characterized by the presence in Egypt of the Asian Hyksos peoples. According to the 1st-century-ce historian Josephus, the Hyksos king, whom he calls Salitis, made his capital at Memphis and from there ruled both Upper and Lower Egypt. Inscriptional and archaeological evidence, though it is scanty, tends to confirm the assumption that the Hyksos controlled northern Egypt, but their capital is generally supposed to have been located at Avaris, near Tanis, in the Nile delta. Records left by Kamose, the 17th-dynasty (c. 1630–1540 bce) king who initiated the reconquest of Egypt from the Hyksos, describe his holdings as extending from Elephantine to Hermopolis Magna but note that he “could not pass by (the invader) as far as Memphis.”\n\nWith the final expulsion of the Hyksos and the restoration of a united kingdom under the 18th dynasty (c. 1539–1292 bce), based at Thebes in Upper Egypt, Memphis entered a new period of prosperity. Some scholars claim that Memphis never lost its political preeminence and that during the New Kingdom (c. 1539–1075 bce), as in earlier times, the city was the actual political capital of Egypt, with Thebes merely the religious centre. Such a hypothesis is impossible to prove, and it may well be that such distinctions, with their rigidity and exclusiveness, are meaningless in terms of Egyptian culture.\n\nThe importance of Memphis was based to a considerable extent on its venerable religious role. Certain of the coronation ceremonies were traditionally enacted in Memphis, as was the Heb-Sed festival, a jubilee celebrated by the king after 30 years of rule and repeated every three years thereafter, perhaps a ritual reenactment of the unification of Egypt.\nThutmose IV, detail of a gray granite sculpture, 15th century bce; in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom, Memphis probably functioned as the second, or northern, capital of Egypt. At one time it seems to have been the principal residence of the crown prince. Several 18th-dynasty inscriptions mention royal hunting parties in the desert near the Sphinx. Amenhotep II (reigned c. 1426–00 bce) was born at Memphis and held the office of high priest there. Both he and his son, Thutmose IV (reigned 1400–1390 bce), left inscriptions at Giza.\n\nDespite the rise of the god Amon of Thebes, Ptah remained one of the principal gods of the pantheon. The great temple of Ptah was added to or rebuilt by virtually every king of the 18th dynasty. Chapels were constructed by Thutmose I, Thutmose IV, and Amenhotep III. Amenhotep III’s son, the religious reformer Akhenaton, built a temple to his god, Aton, in Memphis. A number of handsome private tombs dating from this period in the Memphite necropolis testify to the existence of a sizable court.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom the city shared the increasingly cosmopolitan character of the nation, as trade, foreign conquest, and travel developed. Though Memphis was not on the Nile, it was connected with it by a canal, and it was probably important as a commercial centre. Specific quarters of the city were named for the foreign colonies—slaves, prisoners of war, or merchants—who resided there. A section called the “Field of the Hittites” is known, as are, in later periods, sections inhabited by Carians and Phoenicians.\nRamses II\nRamses II\n\nUnder the 19th dynasty (1292–1190 bce) a new royal residence was built farther north at Per Ramessu in the delta, but Memphis continued to be important. The great temple of Ptah was rebuilt. The kings of that period pillaged the monuments of their predecessors for building materials, and some of the reused blocks come not only from structures in the city but also from temples and pyramid complexes in the Memphite necropolises. Ramses II (reigned 1279–13 bce) erected several colossi in the temple. The Serapeum, dedicated to the cult of Apis, the bull-god, and built in the form of a labyrinth, was begun under the son of Ramses II, Khaemwese, high priest of Ptah.\n\nBy the end of the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bce) the united kingdom had begun to break down once again. The official capitals were Tanis and Thebes, but the royal palace at Memphis also continued to be mentioned. The growing popularity of the Apis cult led to further enlargement of the Serapeum. In the 8th century bce the Nubian king Piye conquered Egypt and restored its unity. Nubia (Kush), to the south of Egypt, had been under Egyptian political and cultural influence for centuries. An inscription describing Piye’s campaign has survived, and it mentions a siege of Memphis. The city had fortified walls and was surrounded by water, presumably from its encircling canals. Piye took the city, but it was left to his brother and successor, Shabaka, to claim the royal title. There are some indications that this king made Memphis his capital. But the Kushite dynasty was overthrown shortly thereafter, when the Assyrians invaded Egypt. Records left by the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680–669 bce) refer to the siege and destruction of Memphis, the royal residence of one Tarku (Taharqa), king of Egypt, who became pharaoh in 690 bce. After the death of Esarhaddon, Taharqa regained Memphis, but he was driven out of the city again by Ashurbanipal of Assyria, in 667/668 bce.\n\nThe collapse of Assyria (612 bce) led to brief Egyptian independence under the 26th dynasty (664–525 bce; see ancient Egypt: The Late period), but it was not long before new invaders appeared. The Persian Cambyses II took Memphis by siege in 525 bce. After years of Persian rule, Egypt was ready to welcome Alexander the Great in 332 bce. The conqueror used Memphis as his headquarters while making plans for his new city of Alexandria. After his death at Babylon, his body was brought to Egypt and was laid to rest temporarily in Memphis before being buried at Alexandria.\n\nUnder the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty (332–30 bce), Memphis retained its cosmopolitan character and had a sizable Greek population. Some of the diversified racial types to be found in the city during Greco-Roman times are depicted in a series of striking terra-cotta heads dating from this period.\n\nAt the beginning of the Roman period (1st century bce), Memphis was still considered an important provincial capital. The serious decay of the ancient city began after the rise of Christianity, when zealots of that faith defaced and destroyed the remaining pagan temples. In the 5th century ce the Christian monastery of Apa Jeremias rose among the venerable tombs of Ṣaqqārah. The capital continued to deteriorate, receiving its death blow during the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640 ce. A garrison and fort called Babylon occupied the eastern end of the bridge that crossed the Nile from Memphis, and after a long siege the fortress was taken by the Arab general ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ. Memphis was abandoned, and later the few remaining structures were dismantled so that the stone might be reused in the neighbouring villages and in Cairo, after that city’s founding in the 10th century.\nArchaeology of Memphis\nMemphis, Egypt: alabaster sphinx\nMemphis, Egypt: alabaster sphinx\n\nThe ancient city of Memphis lies near the modern village of Mīt Ruhaynah. At the beginning of the 20th century some ruined walls were still to be seen, but these have since disappeared, and the only monument above ground is a colossal statue of Ramses II, which once adorned the great temple of Ptah.\n\nThe first archaeologist to work at the city site for any prolonged period was Flinders (later Sir Flinders) Petrie, who excavated between 1908 and 1913, uncovering sections of the great temple of Ptah. These remains, left exposed, soon disappeared under the depredations of the nearby villagers. A University of Pennsylvania expedition worked at the site in 1917, finding foundations of a palace of Merneptah (1213–04 bce), east of the temple of that king. The university sponsored further digging in 1955 and 1956, excavating parts of the great temple and a small temple of Ramses II.\n\nSince about the mid-19th century there has been hardly a season when archaeological activity was not proceeding at one or another of the pyramid sites. Almost all of the pyramids and a majority of the large private tombs were entered by treasure hunters before the beginning of scholarly excavation. One of the earliest scholars to work in the Memphite area was Auguste Mariette, who discovered the Serapeum in 1850. Among the most important of Mariette’s successors were George Andrew Reisner and Hermann Junker, who excavated at Giza; Ludwig Borchardt, who excavated the sun temples and the 5th-dynasty pyramids at Abū Ṣīr; Ahmed Fakhry, who worked in the pyramids of Snefru at Dahshūr; and Zakaria Goneim, who discovered a previously unknown pyramid, probably of the 3rd dynasty, to the southwest of the Step Pyramid at Ṣaqqārah. Also noteworthy are the excavations of J.P. Lauer in the Step Pyramid complex. In the 1930s Walter Bryan Emery began the excavations that uncovered the great 1st-dynasty tombs. His work in the archaic cemetery disclosed another huge labyrinth, resembling that of the Serapeum, the precise function of which is as yet undetermined. Beginning in the 1980s, the Egypt Exploration Society sponsored a long-range survey of the Memphite area to determine its extent and development from different historical periods. Large sculptural and architectural elements recovered from various excavations are displayed at an outdoor museum at Mīt Ruhaynah.",

'the Pillars'; Coptic: ⲱⲛ; Greek: Ἡλιούπολις, romanized: Hēlioúpοlis, lit. 'City of the Sun') was a major city of ancient Egypt. It was the capital of the 13th or Heliopolite Nome of Lower Egypt and a major religious centre. It is now located in Ayn Shams, a northeastern suburb of Cairo.\n\nHeliopolis was one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt, occupied since the Predynastic Period.[1] It greatly expanded under the Old and Middle Kingdoms but is today mostly destroyed, its temples and other buildings having been scavenged for the construction of medieval Cairo. Most information about the ancient city comes from surviving records.\n\nThe major surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the obelisk of the Temple of Ra-Atum erected by Senusret I of Dynasty XII. It still stands in its original position, now within Al-Masalla in Al-Matariyyah, Cairo.[2] The 21 m (69 ft) high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000 lbs) and is believed to be the oldest surviving obelisk in the world.[3] The Romans took the Obelisk of Montecitorio to the city to Rome, under Augustus, where it remains. The two smaller obelisks called Cleopatra's Needle, in London and New York, also came from the city.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Names\n    2 History\n        2.1 Ancient\n        2.2 Hellenistic\n        2.3 Roman\n        2.4 Islamic\n    3 Legacy\n    4 Present site\n    5 See also\n    6 Notes\n    7 References\n        7.1 Citations\n        7.2 Bibliography\n    8 External links\n\nNames\niwn\tnw\nniwt\nHeliopolis\nI͗wnw[a]\nEgyptian hieroglyphs\n\nHeliopolis is the Latinised form of the Greek name Hēlioúpolis (Ἡλιούπολις), meaning \"City of the Sun\". Helios, the personified and deified form of the sun, was identified by the Greeks with the native Egyptian gods Ra and Atum, whose principal cult was located in the city.\n\nIts native name was I͗wnw (\"The Pillars\"), whose exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian recorded only consonantal values. Its traditional Egyptological transcription is Iunu but it appears in biblical Hebrew as ʾŌn (אֹ֖ן‎,[5] אֽוֹן‎[6]), and ʾĀwen (אָ֛וֶן‎[7]) leading some scholars to reconstruct its pronunciation in earlier Egyptian as *ʔa:wnu, perhaps from older /ja:wunaw/. Variant transcriptions include Awnu and Annu. The name survived as Coptic ⲱⲛ Ōn.[8]\n\nThe city also appears in the Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts as the \"House of Ra\".[9]\nHistory\nMap of ancient Lower Egypt showing Heliopolis\nAncient\nFurther information: Ancient Egypt\n\nIn ancient Egypt, Heliopolis was a regional center from predynastic times.\nModel of a Votive Temple Gateway at Heliopolis, Dynasty XIX[10]\n\nIt was principally notable as the cult center of the sun god Atum, who came to be identified with Ra[11] and then Horus. The primary temple of the city was known as the Great House (Ancient Egyptian: Pr Ꜥꜣt or Per Aat, *Par ʻĀʼat) or House of Atum (Pr I͗tmw or Per Atum, *Par-ʼAtāma; Hebrew: פתם, Pithom). Its priests maintained that Atum or Ra was the first being, rising self-created from the primeval waters. A decline in the importance of Ra's cult during Dynasty V led to the development of the Ennead, a grouping of nine major Egyptian deities that placed the others in subordinate status to Ra–Atum. The high priests of Ra are not as well documented as those of other deities, although the high priests of Dynasty VI (c. 2345 – c. 2181 BC) have been discovered and excavated.[12] During the Amarna Period of Dynasty XVIII, Pharaoh Akhenaten introduced a kind of henotheistic worship of Aten, the deified solar disc. As part of his construction projects, he built a Heliopolitan temple named \"Elevating Aten\" (Wṯs I͗tn or Wetjes Aten), whose stones can still be seen in some of the gates of Cairo's medieval city wall. The cult of the Mnevis bull, another embodiment of the Sun, had its altar here as well. The bulls' formal burial ground was situated north of the city.\n\nThe store-city Pithom is mentioned once in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 1:11), and according to one theory, this was Heliopolis.[13]\nHellenistic\n\nAlexander the Great, on his march from Pelusium to Memphis, halted at this city.[14]\n\nThe temple of Ra was said to have been, to a special degree, a depository for royal records, and Herodotus states that the priests of Heliopolis were the best informed in matters of history of all the Egyptians. Heliopolis flourished as a seat of learning during the Greek period; the schools of philosophy and astronomy are claimed to have been frequented by Orpheus, Homer,[15] Pythagoras, Plato, Solon, and other Greek philosophers. Ichonuphys was lecturing there in 308 BC, and the Greek mathematician Eudoxus, who was one of his pupils, learned from him the true length of the year and month, upon which he formed his octaeterid, or period of 8 years or 99 months. Ptolemy II had Manetho, the chief priest of Heliopolis, collect his history of the ancient kings of Egypt from its archives. The later Ptolemies probably took little interest in their \"father\" Ra, and Alexandria had eclipsed the learning of Heliopolis; thus with the withdrawal of royal favour Heliopolis quickly dwindled, and the students of native lore deserted it for other temples supported by a wealthy population of pious citizens. By the first century BC, in fact, Strabo found the temples deserted, and the town itself almost uninhabited, although priests were still present.\n\nHeliopolis was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, being noted by most major geographers of the period, including Ptolemy, Herodotus, and others, down to the Byzantine geographer Stephanus of Byzantium.[16]\nRoman\n\nIn Roman Egypt, Heliopolis belonged to the province Augustamnica, causing it to appear as Heliopolis in Augustamnica when it needed to be distinguished from Roman Heliopolis. Its population probably contained a considerable Arabian element.[17] Many of the city's obelisks were removed to adorn more northern cities of the Delta and Rome. Two of these eventually became London's Cleopatra's Needle and its twin in New York's Central Park.\nBattle of Heliopolis during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1800\nIslamic\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the growth of Fustat and Cairo only a few kilometres away caused its ruins to be massively scavenged for building materials, including for their city walls. The site became known as the \"Eye of the Sun\" (Ayn Shams) and ʻArab al-Ḥiṣn.\nLegacy\n\nThe importance of the solar cult at Heliopolis is reflected in both ancient pagan and current monotheistic beliefs. Egyptian and Greco-Roman mythology held that the bennu or phoenix brought the ashes of its predecessor to the altar of the sun god at Heliopolis each time it was reborn. In the Hebrew's scriptures, Heliopolis is referenced directly and obliquely, usually in reference to its prominent pagan cult. In his prophesies against Egypt, Isaiah claimed the \"City of the Sun\" (Ir ha Shemesh) would be one of the five Egyptian cities to follow the Lord of Heaven's army and speak Hebrew.[18][b] Jeremiah and Ezekiel mention the \"House of the Sun\" (Beth Shemesh) and Ôn, claiming Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon would shatter its obelisks and burn its temple[19] and that its \"young men of Folly\" (Aven) would \"fall by the sword\".[20]\n\nThe \"Syrian Heliopolis\" Baalbek has been claimed to have gained its solar cult from a priest colony emigrating from Egypt.[21]\n\nHeliopolis in Augustamnica remains a titular see of both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nPresent site\n\nThe ancient city is currently located about 15–20 meters (49–66 ft) below the streets of the middle- and lower-class suburbs of Al-Matariyyah,[1] Ain Shams, and Tel Al-Hisn[22] in northern Cairo. The area is about 1.5 kilometers (1 mi) west of the modern suburb which bears its name.[1]\n\nSome ancient city walls of crude brick can be seen in the fields, a few granite blocks bearing the name of Ramesses II remain, and the position of the great Temple of Ra-Atum is marked by the Al-Masalla obelisk. Archaeologists excavated some of its tombs in 2004.[23] In 2017, parts of a colossal statue of Psamtik I were found and excavated.[24]\nSee also\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Heliopolis, ancient Egypt.\n\n    List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\n    Other Heliopolises, particularly\n        Heliopolis, the 20th-century suburb of Cairo\n        Ilioupoli, the 20th-century suburb of Athens settled by Egyptian Greeks\n    Ancient Egyptian creation myths – in reference to the religious belief system of Iunu at Heliopolis\n    List of Egyptian dynasties – in reference to the reigns centered at Heliopolis\n    Benben",

As a child he was serious, quiet and thoughtful. He began drawing at an early age and as a young man  worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having returned home to his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long correspondence by letter.\nHis early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still life and  landscape. His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.\nVan Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation between the two when, in a rage, Van Gogh severed a part of his own left ear with a razor. After, he spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.\nVan Gogh's paintings did not sell during his lifetime, during which he was generally considered a madman and a failure, although some collectors recognised the value of his work. His fame came only after his death, when he evolved in the public imagination into a misunderstood genius. His reputation grew in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.\nToday, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n\n\n== Letters ==\n\nThe most comprehensive primary source on Van Gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother, Theo. Their lifelong friendship, and most of what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890. Theo van Gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support as well as access to influential people on the contemporary art scene.\n\nTheo kept all of Vincent's letters to him; Vincent kept a few of the letters he received. After both had died, Theo's widow Johanna arranged for the publication of some of their letters. A few appeared in 1906 and 1913; the majority were published in 1914. Vincent's letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a \"diary-like intimacy\", and read in parts like autobiography. The translator Arnold Pomerans wrote that their publication adds a \"fresh dimension to the understanding of Van Gogh's artistic achievement, an understanding granted to us by virtually no other painter\".There are more than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister Wil, 58 to the painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard as well as individual letters to Paul Signac, Paul Gauguin, and the critic Albert Aurier. Some are illustrated with sketches. Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from Arles. While there, Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French, and English. There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.The highly paid contemporary artist Jules Breton was frequently mentioned in Vincent's letters. In 1875 letters to Theo, Vincent mentions he saw Breton, discusses the Breton paintings he saw at a Salon, and discusses sending one of Breton's books but only on the condition that it be returned. In a March 1884 letter to Rappard he discusses one of Breton's poems that had inspired one of his own paintings. In 1885 he describes Breton's famous work The Song of the Lark as being \"fine\". In March 1880, roughly midway between these letters, Van Gogh set out on an 80-kilometre trip on foot to meet with Breton in the village of Courrières; however, he was apparently intimidated by Breton's success and/or the high wall around his estate. He turned around and returned without making his presence known. It appears Breton was unaware of Van Gogh or his attempted visit. There are no known letters between the two artists and Van Gogh is not one of the contemporary artists discussed by Breton in his 1891 autobiography Life of an Artist.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nVincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family. The name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology graduate at the University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague, and his father was the youngest son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851, and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as \"Wil\"). In later life, Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her. Theodorus's salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child. He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860, was sent to the village school. In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was \"austere and cold, and sterile\".In July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch on Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and, at 20, was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art, and he was dismissed a year later.\n\nIn April 1876, he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out, and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 he returned home at Christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.To support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor, in 1877, the family sent him to live with his uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected theologian, in Amsterdam. Van Gogh prepared for the University of Amsterdam theology entrance examination; he failed the exam and left his uncle's house in July 1878. He undertook, but also failed, a three-month course at a Protestant missionary school in Laken, near Brussels.In January 1879, he took up a post as a missionary at Petit-Wasmes in the coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium. To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut, where he slept on straw. His squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him for \"undermining the dignity of the priesthood\". He then walked the 75 kilometres (47 mi) to Brussels, returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten. He stayed there until around March 1880, which caused concern and frustration for his parents. His father was especially frustrated and advised that his son be committed to the lunatic asylum Geel.Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and he recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest. He traveled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.\n\n\n=== Etten, Drenthe and The Hague ===\n\nVan Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia \"Kee\" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older than he was and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She refused with the words \"No, nay, never\" (\"nooit, neen, nimmer\"). After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, Anton Mauve. Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be. Mauve invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; Van Gogh returned to Etten and followed this advice.Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote a letter to Johannes Stricker, one which he described to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his \"persistence is disgusting\". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: \"Let me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the flame.\" He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.Mauve took Van Gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. In January 1882, Mauve introduced him to painting in oil and lent him money to set up a studio. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and he spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were.\n\nBy March 1882, Mauve appeared to have gone cold towards Van Gogh, and he stopped replying to his letters. He had learned of Van Gogh's new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute, Clasina Maria \"Sien\" Hoornik (1850–1904), and her young daughter. Van Gogh had met Sien towards the end of January 1882, when she had a five-year-old daughter and was pregnant. She had previously borne two children who died, but Van Gogh was unaware of this. On 2 July, she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem. When Van Gogh's father discovered the details of their relationship, he put pressure on his son to abandon Sien and her two children. Vincent at first defied him, and considered moving the family out of the city, but in late 1883, he left Sien and the children.Poverty may have pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her daughter to her mother and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam when he was about 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in 1904.In September 1883, Van Gogh moved to Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. In December driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in Nuenen, North Brabant.\n\n\n=== Emerging artist ===\n\n\n==== Nuenen and Antwerp (1883–1886) ====\n\nIn Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March 2020. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguished his later work.There was interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885. Theo asked Vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit. In May, Van Gogh responded with his first major work, The Potato Eaters, and a series of \"peasant character studies\" which were the culmination of several years of work. When he complained that Theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in Paris, his brother responded that they were too dark and not in keeping with the bright style of Impressionism. In August his work was publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague. One of his young peasant sitters became pregnant in September 1885; Van Gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her, and the village priest forbade parishioners to model for him.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nHe moved to Antwerp that November and rented a room above a paint dealer's shop in the rue des Images (Lange Beeldekensstraat). He lived in poverty and ate poorly, preferring to spend the money Theo sent on painting materials and models. Bread, coffee and tobacco became his staple diet. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous May. His teeth became loose and painful. In Antwerp he applied himself to the study of colour theory and spent time in museums—particularly studying the work of Peter Paul Rubens—and broadened his palette to include carmine, cobalt blue and emerald green. Van Gogh bought Japanese ukiyo-e woodcuts in the docklands, later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings. He was drinking heavily again, and was hospitalised between February and March 1886, when he was possibly also treated for syphilis.After his recovery, despite his antipathy towards academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and, in January 1886, matriculated in painting and drawing. He became ill and run down by overwork, poor diet and excessive smoking. He started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the Antwerp Academy on 18 January 1886. He quickly got into trouble with Charles Verlat, the director of the academy and teacher of a painting class, because of his unconventional painting style. Van Gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class Franz Vinck. Van Gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by Eugène Siberdt. Soon Siberdt and Van Gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with Siberdt's requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line. When Van Gogh was required to draw the Venus of Milo during a drawing class, he produced the limbless, naked torso of a Flemish peasant woman. Siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to Van Gogh's drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper. Van Gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at Siberdt: 'You clearly do not know what a young woman is like, God damn it! A woman must have hips, buttocks, a pelvis in which she can carry a baby!' According to some accounts, this was the last time Van Gogh attended classes at the academy and he left later for Paris. On 31 March 1886, which was about a month after the confrontation with Siberdt, the teachers of the academy decided that 17 students, including Van Gogh, had to repeat a year. The story that Van Gogh was expelled from the academy by Siberdt is therefore unfounded.\n\n\n==== Paris (1886–1888) ====\n\nVan Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in Montmartre and studied at Fernand Cormon's studio. In June the brothers took a larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. In Paris, Vincent painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asnières and along the Seine. In 1885 in Antwerp he had become interested in Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints and had used them to decorate the walls of his studio; while in Paris he collected hundreds of them. He tried his hand at Japonaiserie, tracing a figure from a reproduction on the cover of the magazine Paris Illustre, The Courtesan or Oiran (1887), after Keisai Eisen, which he then graphically enlarged in a painting.After seeing the portrait of Adolphe Monticelli at the Galerie Delareybarette, Van Gogh adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, particularly in paintings such as his Seascape at Saintes-Maries (1888). Two years later, Vincent and Theo paid for the publication of a book on Monticelli paintings, and Vincent bought some of Monticelli's works to add to his collection.Van Gogh learned about Fernand Cormon's atelier from Theo. He worked at the studio in April and May 1886, where he frequented the circle of the Australian artist John Peter Russell, who painted his portrait in 1886. Van Gogh also met fellow students Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec – who painted a portrait of him in pastel. They met at Julien \"Père\" Tanguy's paint shop, (which was, at that time, the only place where Paul Cézanne's paintings were displayed). In 1886, two large exhibitions were staged there, showing Pointillism and Neo-impressionism for the first time and bringing attention to Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Theo kept a stock of Impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard Montmartre, but Van Gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art.Conflicts arose between the brothers. At the end of 1886 Theo found living with Vincent to be \"almost unbearable\". By early 1887, they were again at peace, and Vincent had moved to Asnières, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where he got to know Signac. He adopted elements of Pointillism, a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues. The style stresses the ability of complementary colours – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile in Asnières Van Gogh painted parks, restaurants and the Seine, including Bridges across the Seine at Asnières. In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris. Towards the end of the year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in Paris. There, Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.\n\n\n=== Artistic breakthrough ===\n\n\n==== Arles (1888–89) ====\n\nIll from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and, at first, Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: \"The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world.\"The time in Arles became one of Van Gogh's more prolific periods: he completed 200 paintings and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local countryside and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. They include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others. \nThe portrayals of Arles are informed by his Dutch upbringing; the patchworks of fields and avenues are flat and lacking perspective, but excel in their use of colour.In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded \"perspective frame\"; three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. In April, he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight, who was living nearby at Fontvieille. On 1 May 1888, for 15 francs per month, he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the Yellow House at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.On 7 May, Van Gogh moved from the Hôtel Carrel to the Café de la Gare, having befriended the proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux. The Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, but he was able to use it as a studio. He wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Café (1888), Café Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House.Van Gogh wrote that with The Night Café he tried \"to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime\". When he visited Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in June, he gave lessons to a Zouave second lieutenant – Paul-Eugène Milliet – and painted boats on the sea and the village. MacKnight introduced Van Gogh to Eugène Boch, a Belgian painter who sometimes stayed in Fontvieille, and the two exchanged visits in July.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Gauguin's visit (1888) ====\n \n\nWhen Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship and the realisation of his idea of an artists' collective. While waiting, in August he painted Sunflowers. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, as well as the study The Poet Against a Starry Sky.In preparation for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on advice from the station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September, he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in Arles with him, Van Gogh started to work on the Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.After much pleading from Van Gogh, Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October and, in November, the two painted together. Gauguin depicted Van Gogh in his The Painter of Sunflowers; Van Gogh painted pictures from memory, following Gauguin's suggestion. Among these \"imaginative\" paintings is Memory of the Garden at Etten. Their first joint outdoor venture was at the Alyscamps, when they produced the pendants Les Alyscamps. The single painting Gauguin completed during his visit was his portrait of Van Gogh.Van Gogh and Gauguin visited Montpellier in December 1888, where they saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Musée Fabre. Their relationship began to deteriorate; Van Gogh admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated Van Gogh. They often quarrelled; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him, and the situation, which Van Gogh described as one of \"excessive tension\", rapidly headed towards crisis point.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Hospital in Arles (December 1888) ====\n\nThe exact sequence that led to the mutilation of his ear are not known. Gauguin said, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who suspected the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Vincent realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin recalled that Van Gogh followed him after he left for a walk and \"rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand.\" This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely staying in a hotel.After an altercation on the evening of 23 December 1888, Van Gogh returned to his room where he seemingly heard voices and either wholly or in part severed his left ear with a razor causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where he was treated by Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training. The ear was brought to the hospital, but Rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed. Van Gogh researcher and art historian Bernadette Murphy discovered the true identity of the woman named Gabrielle, who died in Arles at the age of 80 in 1952, and whose descendants still live just outside Arles. Gabrielle, known in her youth as \"Gaby,\" was a 17-year-old cleaning girl at the brothel and other local establishments at the time Van Gogh presented her with his ear.Van Gogh had no recollection of the event, suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown. The hospital diagnosis was \"acute mania with generalised delirium\", and within a few days, the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care. Gauguin immediately notified Theo, who, on 24 December, had proposed marriage to his old friend Andries Bonger's sister Johanna. That evening, Theo rushed to the station to board a night train to Arles. He arrived on Christmas Day and comforted Vincent, who seemed to be semi-lucid. That evening, he left Arles for the return trip to Paris.During the first days of his treatment, Van Gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to \"be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for me tell him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him.\" Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond, and in 1890, Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Meanwhile, other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.Despite a pessimistic diagnosis, Van Gogh recovered and returned to the Yellow House on 7 January 1889. He spent the following month between hospital and home, suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning. In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as \"le fou roux\" (the redheaded madman); Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March; in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home. Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Around this time, he wrote, \"Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant.\"Van Gogh gave his 1889 Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey to Dr Rey. The physician was not fond of the painting and used it to repair a chicken coop, then gave it away. In 2016, the portrait was housed at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and estimated to be worth over $50 million.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Saint-Rémy (May 1889 – May 1890) ====\n\nVan Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron. Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio. The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings. He made several studies of the hospital's interiors, such as Vestibule of the Asylum and Saint-Rémy (September 1889), and its gardens, such as Lilacs (May 1889). Some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls, such as The Starry Night. He was allowed short supervised walks, during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees, including Valley with Ploughman Seen from Above, Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background 1889, Cypresses 1889, Cornfield with Cypresses (1889), Country road in Provence by Night (1890). In September 1889, he produced two further versions of Bedroom in Arles.Limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and variations on his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.His Prisoners' Round (after Gustave Doré) (1890) was painted after an engraving by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). Tralbaut suggests that the face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself; Jan Hulsker discounts this.Between February and April 1890, Van Gogh suffered a severe relapse. Depressed and unable to bring himself to write, he was still able to paint and draw a little during this time, and he later wrote to Theo that he had made a few small canvases \"from memory ... reminisces of the North\". Among these was Two Peasant Women Digging in a Snow-Covered Field at Sunset. Hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that Van Gogh worked on during this time. He comments that this short period was the only time that Van Gogh's illness had a significant effect on his work. Van Gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches. Belonging to this period is Sorrowing Old Man (\"At Eternity's Gate\"), a colour study Hulsker describes as \"another unmistakable remembrance of times long past\". His late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities, according to the art critic Robert Hughes, \"longing for concision and grace\".After the birth of his nephew, Van Gogh wrote, \"I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky.\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n1890 Exhibitions and recognition\nSee also Vincent van Gogh's display at Les XX, 1890\nAlbert Aurier praised his work in the Mercure de France in January 1890 and described him as \"a genius\". In February, Van Gogh painted five versions of L'Arlésienne (Madame Ginoux), based on a charcoal sketch Gauguin had produced when she sat for both artists in November 1888. Also in February, Van Gogh was invited by Les XX, a society of avant-garde painters in Brussels, to participate in their annual exhibition. At the opening dinner a Les XX member, Henry de Groux, insulted Van Gogh's work. Toulouse-Lautrec demanded satisfaction, and Signac declared he would continue to fight for Van Gogh's honour if Lautrec surrendered. De Groux apologised for the slight and left the group.\nFrom 20 March to 27 April 1890, Van Gogh was included in the sixth exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in the Pavillon de la Ville de Paris on the Champs-Elysées. Van Gogh exhibited ten paintings. Eight of these can be identified as Cypresses (F 613 / JH 1746 ), Road menders (‘The tall plane trees’) (F 657 / JH 1860 ), Ravine (F 662 / JH 1804 ), Avenue of chestnut trees in blossom (F 517 / JH 1689 ), Mulberry tree (F 637 / JH 1796 ), Trees with ivy in the garden of the asylum (F 609 / JH 1693 ), Wheatfield at sunrise (F 737 / JH 1862 ). ‘Les Tournesols’ is either Sunflowers in a vase (F 454 / JH 1562 ) or Sunflowers in a vase (F 456 / JH 1561 ) Wheatfield after a storm (F 611 / JH 1723 ) and Olive grove (F 586 / JH 1854 ).While Van Gogh's exhibit was on display with the Artistes Indépendants in Paris, Claude Monet said that his work was the best in the show.\n\n\n==== Auvers-sur-Oise (May–July 1890) ====\n\nIn May 1890, Van Gogh left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had recommended him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was \"iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much.\"\n\nThe painter Charles Daubigny moved to Auvers in 1861 and in turn drew other artists there, including Camille Corot and Honoré Daumier. In July 1890, Van Gogh completed two paintings of Daubigny's Garden, one of which is likely his final work.\n\nDuring his last weeks at Saint-Rémy, his thoughts returned to \"memories of the North\", and several of the approximately 70 oils, painted during as many days in Auvers-sur-Oise, are reminiscent of northern scenes. In June 1890, he painted several portraits of his doctor, including Portrait of Dr Gachet, and his only etching. In each the emphasis is on Gachet's melancholic disposition. There are other paintings which are probably unfinished, including Thatched Cottages by a Hill.In July, Van Gogh wrote that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\". He had first become captivated by the fields in May, when the wheat was young and green. In July, he described to Theo \"vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies\".He wrote that they represented his \"sadness and extreme loneliness\" and that the \"canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside\". Wheatfield with Crows, although not his last oil work, is from July 1890 and Hulsker discusses it as being associated with \"melancholy and extreme loneliness\". Hulsker identifies seven oil paintings from Auvers that follow the completion of Wheatfield with Crows.Research published in 2020 by senior researchers at the museum Louis van Tilborgh and Teio Meedendorp, reviewing findings of Wouter van der Veen, the scientific director of the Institut Van Gogh, concluded that it was \"highly plausible\" that the exact location where Van Gogh's final work Tree Roots was some 150 metres (490 ft) from the Auberge Ravoux inn where he was staying, where a stand of trees with a tangle of gnarled roots grew on a hillside. These trees with gnarled roots are shown in a postcard from 1900 to 1910. Mr Van der Veen believes Van Gogh may have been working on the painting just hours before his death.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nOn 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux pinfire revolver. There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or in a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as well as they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent's health began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nVan Gogh was buried on 30 July, in the municipal cemetery of Auvers-sur-Oise. The funeral was attended by Theo van Gogh, Andries Bonger, Charles Laval, Lucien Pissarro, Émile Bernard, Julien Tanguy and Paul Gachet, among twenty family members, friends and locals. Theo had been ill, and his health began to decline further after his brother's death. Weak and unable to come to terms with Vincent's absence, he died on 25 January 1891 at Den Dolder and was buried in Utrecht. In 1914, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger had Theo's body exhumed and moved from Utrecht to be re-buried alongside Vincent's at Auvers-sur-Oise.There have been numerous debates as to the nature of Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.The gun Van Gogh was reputed to have used was rediscovered in 1965 and was auctioned, on 19 June 2019, as \"the most famous weapon in art history\". The gun sold for €162,500 (£144,000; $182,000), almost three times more than expected.\n\n\n== Style and works ==\n\n\n=== Artistic development ===\n\nVan Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working en plein air. Vincent wrote that he could now \"go on painting with new vigour\". From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known Hague School artists like Weissenbruch and Blommers, and he received technical advice from them as well as from painters like De Bock and Van der Weele, both of the Hague School's second generation. He moved to Nuenen after a short period of time in Drenthe and began work on several large paintings but destroyed most of them. The Potato Eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived. Following a visit to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the Dutch Masters, especially Rembrandt and Frans Hals. He was aware many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise, so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and develop his skills.\n\nTheo criticised The Potato Eaters for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style. During Van Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His Portrait of Père Tanguy (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an evolving personal style. Charles Blanc's treatise on colour interested him greatly and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that \"colour expresses something in itself\". According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a \"psychological and moral weight\", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of The Night Café, a work he wanted to \"express the terrible passions of humanity\". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature; during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.\n\nVan Gogh stayed within what he called the \"guise of reality\" and was critical of overly stylised works. He wrote afterwards that the abstraction of Starry Night had gone too far and that reality had \"receded too far in the background\". Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl, reminiscent of Hokusai's Great Wave, the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below, and the painter's vision is \"translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint\".Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre, a collection that reflected his personal vision and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word \"purposeful\" to paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies. He painted many series of studies; most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends. The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower, Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.\n\n\n=== Major series ===\n\nVan Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.\n\n\n==== Portraits ====\n\nThe portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He believed they were \"the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite.\" He wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from photographs.In December 1888 he painted La Berceuse – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a culmination of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Self-portraits ====\n\nVan Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.The self-portraits reflect an unusually high degree of self-scrutiny. Often they were intended to mark important periods in his life; for example, the mid-1887 Paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Signac. In Self-Portrait with Grey Felt Hat, heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas. It is one of his most renowned self-portraits of that period, \"with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes, and the novel halo derived from the Neo-impressionist repertoire was what Van Gogh himself called a 'purposeful' canvas\".They contain a wide array of physiognomical representations. Van Gogh's mental and physical condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with full lips, a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.Van Gogh's gaze is seldom directed at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few does he depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Flowers ====\n\nVan Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the London National Gallery, evoke the \"texture of the seed-heads\".In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather, the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, who was about to visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888: \"I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers ... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the whole thing in one go.\"The sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Cypresses and olives ====\n\nFifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated with in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were traditionally seen as emblematic of death. The series of cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: \"Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers\"; he went on to say, \"They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk.\"In mid-1889, and at his sister Wil's request, Van Gogh painted several smaller versions of Wheat Field with Cypresses. The works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and include The Starry Night, in which cypresses dominate the foreground. In addition to this, other notable works on cypresses include Cypresses (1889), Cypresses with Two Figures (1889–90), and Road with Cypress and Star (1890).During the last six or seven months of the year 1889, he had also created at least fifteen paintings of olive trees, a subject which he considered as demanding and compelling. Among these works are Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background (1889), about which in a letter to his brother Van Gogh wrote, \"At last I have a landscape with olives\". While in Saint-Rémy, Van Gogh spent time outside the asylum, where he painted trees in the olive groves. In these works, natural life is rendered as gnarled and arthritic as if a personification of the natural world, which are, according to Hughes, filled with \"a continuous field of energy of which nature is a manifestation\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Orchards ====\n\nThe Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) are among the first groups of work completed after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he brought to this series a version of Impressionism, a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found \"a world of motifs that could not have been more Japanese\". Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and \"one big [painting] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled\".During this period Van Gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Wheat fields ====\n\nVan Gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.Many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and, right up to the time of Van Gogh's death, reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health. Yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns. Writing in July 1890, from Auvers, Van Gogh said that he had become absorbed \"in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow\".Van Gogh was captivated by the fields in May when the wheat was young and green. His Wheatfields at Auvers with White House shows a more subdued palette of yellows and blues, which creates a sense of idyllic harmony.About 10 July 1890, Van Gogh wrote to Theo of \"vast fields of wheat under troubled skies\". Wheatfield with Crows shows the artist's state of mind in his final days; Hulsker describes the work as a \"doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows\". Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes convey a sense of menace.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Reputation and legacy ==\n\nAfter Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and collectors. In 1887, André Antoine hung Van Gogh's alongside works of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris; some were acquired by Julien Tanguy. In 1889, his work was described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier as characterised by \"fire, intensity, sunshine\". Ten paintings were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels in January 1890. French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was said to have been impressed by Van Gogh's work.After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at Les XX; in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In 1892, Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an \"infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he lived.\"Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent's most vocal and well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband or her brother-in-law very long and who suddenly had to take care of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of 27.\n\nIn 1892, Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894, the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris agreed to take 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited John Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.In Paris in 1901, a large Van Gogh retrospective was held at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, which excited André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck, and contributed to the emergence of Fauvism. Important group exhibitions took place with the Sonderbund artists in Cologne in 1912, the Armory Show, New York in 1913, and Berlin in 1914. Henk Bremmer was instrumental in teaching and talking about Van Gogh, and introduced Helene Kröller-Müller to Van Gogh's art; she became an avid collector of his work. The early figures in German Expressionism such as Emil Nolde acknowledged a debt to Van Gogh's work. Bremmer assisted Jacob Baart de la Faille, whose catalogue raisonné L'Oeuvre de Vincent van Gogh appeared in 1928.\nVan Gogh's fame reached its first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I, helped by the publication of his letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are expressive and literate, and have been described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist Irving Stone wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled Lust for Life, based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the 1956 film further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of Van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.\n\nIn 1957, Francis Bacon based a series of paintings on reproductions of Van Gogh's The Painter on the Road to Tarascon, the original of which was destroyed during the Second World War. Bacon was inspired by an image he described as \"haunting\", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: \"[R]eal painters do not paint things as they are ... [T]hey paint them as they themselves feel them to be.\"Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings. Those sold for over US$100 million (today's equivalent) include Portrait of Dr Gachet, Portrait of Joseph Roulin and Irises. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired a copy of Wheat Field with Cypresses in 1993 for US$57 million by using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist Walter Annenberg. In 2015, L'Allée des Alyscamps sold for US$66.3 million at Sotheby's, New York, exceeding its reserve of US$40 million.Minor planet 4457 van Gogh is named in his honour.\n\n\n=== Van Gogh Museum ===\n\nVan Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh (1890–1978), inherited the estate after his mother's death in 1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the entire collection. Theo's son participated in planning the project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect Gerrit Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his death in 1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge. Work progressed throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.The Van Gogh Museum opened in the Museumplein in Amsterdam in 1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum, regularly receiving more than 1.5 million visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million. Eighty-five percent of the visitors come from other countries.\n\n\n== Nazi-looted art ==\n\nDuring the Nazi period (1933–1945) a great number of artworks by Van Gogh changed hands, many of them looted from Jewish collectors who were forced into exile or murdered. Some of these works have disappeared into private collections. Others have since resurfaced in museums, or at auction, or have been reclaimed, often in high-profile lawsuits, by their former owners. The German Lost Art Foundation still lists dozens of missing van Goghs and the American Alliance of Museums lists 73 van Goghs on the Nazi Era Provenance Internet Portal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Vincent van Gogh Gallery, the complete works and letters of Van Gogh\nVincent van Gogh The letters, the complete letters of Van Gogh (translated into English and annotated)\nVincent Van Gogh, teaching resource on Van Gogh\nWorks by Vincent van Gogh at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Vincent van Gogh at Internet Archive\nWorks by Vincent van Gogh at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks)\nHis early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still life and  landscape. His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.\nVan Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation between the two when, in a rage, Van Gogh severed a part of his own left ear with a razor. After, he spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.\nVan Gogh's paintings did not sell during his lifetime, during which he was generally considered a madman and a failure, although some collectors recognized the value of his work. His fame came only after his death, when he evolved in the public imagination into a misunderstood genius. His reputation grew in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.\nToday, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honored by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.\n\n\ngerrit rietveld, paul cézanne, paul signac, van gogh, pushkin museum, twelve sunflowers, doctor félix rey, eugène boch, honoré daumier, madame ginoux, institut van gogh, constant cornelis huijsmans, grey felt hat, eugène siberdt, den dolder, the hague, les alyscamps, marie françois sadi carnot, peter paul, jan hulsker, parsonage garden, great wave, night café, auberge ravoux, project gutenberg works, gustave courbet, frédéric salles, octave mirbeau, night cafe, henry de groux, les tournesols, rijksmuseum van gogh, antwerp academy, émile bernard, berceuse triptych, henri matisse, hôtel carrel, andré antoine, southampton street, fernand cormon, willem roelofs, vincent van gogh, peasant women digging, albert aurier, margot begemann, paul gauguin, keisai eisen, van gogh works, yellow house, de bock, new york, gustave doré, van rappard, paul gachet, american alliance, le moulin, lange beeldekensstraat, john peter russell, white house, charles laval, de groux, johannes stricker, andré derain, charles daubigny, old mill, german lost art foundation, le moderniste illustré, emil nolde, river scheldt, van gogh.van gogh, wheat field, singer laren, melissa mcquillan, francis bacon, anton mauve, walter annenberg, marie ginoux\n",

      "text": "\nDear Theo,\nIt’s Saturday again, and I’m writing a few words once more. I’m longing so much to see you again, oh, I can long for it so much sometimes. Do write soon and tell me how you are.\nLast Wednesday afternoon we took a lovely walk to a village an hour away from here. The road there goes through meadows and fields, along hedgerows of hawthorn full of blackberries and clematis and here and there a tall elm tree. It was so beautiful when the sun went down behind the grey clouds and when the shadows were long, and we chanced to meet Mr Stokes’s school,1 where there are still several boys I know.\nThe clouds kept their red glow long after the sun had set and the twilight was gathering over the fields, and in the distance we saw the street-lamps being lit in the village. This morning there was also a beautiful sunrise. I see it every morning when I wake the boys up.\nLast night I opened that book by Souvestre again (Le philosophe sous les toits),2 and I found such a friendly description of Paris in it, a kind description; I copied it out for Pa and Ma, perhaps you’ll like it too:\n\n9 May. The beautiful evenings have returned; the trees are beginning to uncurl their buds. Hyacinths, daffodils, violets and lilacs scent the flower-sellers’ stalls; the crowds have begun to stroll along the quays and boulevards again. After supper, I too came down from my garret to breathe the evening air.  1v:2\nIt is the hour when Paris shows herself in all her beauty. During the day, the plaster of the facades fatigues the eye with its monotonous whiteness, the heavily laden carts make the cobblestones shudder under their huge wheels, the hurrying crowds cross and collide, intent on not missing a moment of business; there is something harsh, anxious, breathless about the city. But everything changes the moment the stars come out; the white houses fade into misty shadow; nothing is to be heard but the wheels of carriages as they bowl along on their way to some party or other; nothing is to be seen but people strolling idly or gaily by; work gives way to leisure. Now everyone draws breath from that fierce race through the day’s activities; what strength remains is given over to pleasure! See the dance-halls lighting up their colonnades, the theatres opening, the tit-bit stalls lining the avenues, the newsvendors making their lanterns shine. Paris has clearly put aside the pen, the ruler and the apron; after the day dedicated to work it wants to keep the evening for enjoyment; like the masters of Thebes it has put off serious business till the morrow. I love to share this festive time — not to take part in the general gaiety but to observe it. The joy of others may embitter jealous hearts, but it fortifies submissive hearts; it is the ray of sunshine that opens up those two lovely flowers called ‘confidence’ and ‘hope’.\n\nUsually, the view that opens before my window delights me. It is a clutter of roofs whose tops overlap and criss-cross, superimposed on one another, and upon which the tall chimneys raise their peaks. Yesterday I still found something Alpine about them, and waited for the first snow, to see glaciers on them; today I see nothing but tiles and stovepipes. The pigeons that fed my rustic fantasies now seem no more than poor feathered creatures that have taken the roofs for a farmyard; the smoke that rises in faint wisps, instead of giving me dreams of the vent-holes of Vesuvius makes me think of cooking and dish-water; lastly, the telegraph that I can see from afar, on the old tower of Montmartre, looks to me like a revolting gallows whose arm rises above the city.3\n\nIn sorrow did I bow my head\nThere is no peace on earth I said\nThe world is strong\nAnd mocks the song\nOf ‘peace on earth, Goodwill to men’!\n\nThen pealed the bells more loud and deep:\n‘God is not dead! nor doth He sleep!\nWhat’s wrong shall fail\nWhat’s right prevail\nWith peace on earth, goodwill to men.’4\n\nThere’s still a lot to do here for many to whom God gives His blessing and whose lives He spares.5\n 1v:3\nWhile I was writing to you I was summoned to Mr Jones, who asked if I felt like walking to London for him to collect some money. And when I returned in the evening, happily there was a letter from Pa with news of you! How I’d like to be with you, with Pa and with you,6 old boy. And thank God you’re a little better, even though you’re still weak. And you’ll be longing to see Ma too, and now that I hear you’re going home with Ma it makes me think of a passage in Conscience:\n\nI have been ill. My spirit was weary, my soul disenchanted, my body sickly. I, whom God has at least endowed with moral energy and a vast instinct for affection, was falling into the depths of the bitterest discouragement, and I felt with terror a deadly poison creeping into my shrivelled heart. I have spent three months on the heath: you know, that lovely region where the soul returns to itself and enjoys sweet repose; where everything exudes peace and tranquillity; where the soul, in the presence of God’s immaculate creation, shakes off the yoke of convention, forgets society and frees itself from its bonds with the vigour of returning youth; where every thought takes on the form of prayer; where the heart is emptied of everything that is not in harmony with the freshness and freedom of nature. Oh, there the weary soul finds calm; there, the exhausted man regains a youthful strength. Thus were my days of sickness spent, days of ineffable joy for my soul: smiling at the sun when, in all its majesty, it casts its first rays over the horizon; watching the countryside awaken and catching the first notes of the glorious hymn it addresses to heaven; roaming heaths and forests; questioning my soul — and thinking — scrutinizing and admiring the life of plants and animals, taking deep breaths of the pure air, stopping, going on, turning back, and talking out loud in the solitude; dreaming of splendid things: of God, of the future, of our dear Flanders, of peace and love. And in the evening! To sit under the wide chimney-piece, feet in the ashes, eyes fixed upon a star that sends me its light from on high through the chimney-top, as if calling out to me; or, sunk in a vague reverie, to look at the fire, watching the flames come to life, grow, gasp and crackle, pushing each other aside as if vying to lick the cooking-pot with their tongues of fire — and to imagine that this is human life: to be born, to work, to love, to grow up, and to die.... Up above, smoke crowns the chimney with its weightless plume; of all that noise, that crackling, that heat, nothing more comes forth.7\n\nMr Jones has promised me that I won’t have to teach so much any more, but that I may work in his parish from now on, visiting people, talking to them, and so on. May God give this His blessing. Father, I pray that Thou dost not take me out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep me from the evil.8  1r:4\nNow I’ll tell you about my walk to London. I left here at noon and arrived where I had to be between 5 and 6 o’clock and posted the letter to Pa and Ma along the way.\nWhen I came to the neighbourhood in the city where most of the galleries are, in the neighbourhood of the Strand, I met a lot of acquaintances; it was right at lunch-time and so there were a lot of people on the street, coming from or going to their offices. First of all, I met a young clergyman who used to preach here and with whom I became acquainted at that time, then Mr Wallis’s clerk and then one of the Messrs Wallis himself, in those days I went to their house once or twice – he already has two children9 – and then I ran into Mr Reid10 and Mr Richardson,11 who are old friends by now. Last year at this time Mr Richardson was in Paris, and we walked together to Père Lachaise.12 Afterwards I went to see Van Wisselingh, where I saw sketches for two church windows.13\nIn the middle of one of the windows the portrait of an elderly lady, such a noble face, with the words ‘Thy will be done’14 inscribed above; in the other window the portrait of her daughter, with the words ‘Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen’.15 There, as well as in the gallery of Messrs G.&Cie,16 I saw beautiful paintings and drawings, it’s such a deep pleasure to be reminded time and again of Holland through art.\nIn the City17 I also went to see Mr Gladwell18 and to St Paul’s. And from the City to the other end of London, there I visited a boy who had left Mr Stokes’s school because of illness, and I found him completely recovered, outside in the street. Then on to the place where I had to collect the money for Mr Jones. The suburbs of London have a peculiar beauty; between the small houses and gardens there are open places covered with grass and usually with a church or school or poorhouse between the trees and shrubbery in the middle, and it can be so beautiful there when the sun goes down red in the light evening mist. It was like that yesterday evening, and later I did so wish that you had seen the streets of London when it began to grow dark and the street-lamps were lit and everyone was going home, it was obvious from everything that it was Saturday evening, and in all that hustle and bustle there was peace, one felt, as it were, the need for and joy at the approach of Sunday. Oh those Sundays and how much is done and striven for on those Sundays, it’s such a relief to those poor neighbourhoods and busy streets. It was dark in the City, but it was a lovely walk past all those churches along the way. Close to the Strand I found an omnibus that brought me a long way, it was already rather late. I rode past Mr Jones’s little church19 and saw another in the distance where light was still burning so late. I headed for it and found it to be a very beautiful little Roman Catholic church20 in which a couple of women were praying. Then I came to that dark park I already wrote to you about,21 and from there I saw in the distance the lights of Isleworth and the church with the ivy and the cemetery with the weeping willows on the banks of the Thames.  1r:5\nNow then, Theo, get well soon and read this letter sometime when Ma is sitting with you, because I’d very much like to be with you both in thought. I’m really very glad that Mr Jones has promised to let me work in his parish, and that I’ll eventually find the right thing. We must seek that, but God must help and that He does, there is no life that He cannot sanctify and inspire. May I also discover ‘that this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ came into the world to save sinners’,22 being useful and of some value.\nI long so much to see you sometimes. A hearty handshake to you, and give Ma your hand for me when she’s sitting with you. Adieu.\n\nYour most loving brother,\nVincent\n\nAdieu. May God grant that I find grace in the eyes of my Father and Mother and in the eyes of those who will come after me. And now, my boy, another word to you. He who puts himself in a Christian sphere, and seeks and does Christian work as best he can, he will soon feel that he is on a path that he must traverse whether he wants to or not, and will cry out in anguish, God help me, I can do nothing else, and God hears this cry and God is a more powerful help in life than all human and worldly help.  1v:6\n\nPsalm 107\n\nO Give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath redeemed. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.\nThen they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.\nHe brought them out of darkness, and brake their bands in sunder. For He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.\nThey that go down to the sea in ships, these see the great works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep.\nFor He commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and He bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.\nHe setteth the poor on high. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice.23\n\nMan proposes, but God disposes.24\n\nProtect me O God, for my bark is so small and Thy sea is so great.25\n\nOnly they that brave its dangers know the secret of the sea, understand its mystery.26\n\nI hope to receive tomorrow, for the second time, some money for my new work, and to buy a pair of new boots and a new hat with it. And then, God willing, we shall ‘rise up once again’.27\n\nMany regards to everyone at the Rooses’ and to everyone I know, especially everyone at Mr Tersteeg’s and at the Van Stockums’ and the Haanebeeks’.\n\nTell Ma that it was such a delight, after that journey to London, to put on a pair of socks that she’d knitted.\n\nIn the streets of London they’re selling sweet violets everywhere; they flower here twice a year. I bought some for Mrs Jones to make up for the pipe I smoke here now and then, mostly late in the evening in the playground. The tobacco here is rather strong, though.\ntop\n093\nBr. 1990: 092 | CL: 76\nFrom: Vincent van Gogh\nTo: Theo van Gogh\nDate: Isleworth, Saturday, 7 and Sunday, 8 October 1876\nmore...\n\n1. Since Van Gogh’s former employer, Mr Stokes, had moved his school in June, Stokes’s school was near that of Slade-Jones; see letter 86, n. 1.\n2. Emile Souvestre, Un philosophe sous les toits. Journal d’un homme heureux. Paris 1850 (The philosopher in a garret. Diary of a happy man). The book has twelve chapters, each of which relates the events of one day of one month. The protagonist presents the reader with his observations concerning everyday human actions and suggests which virtues are most important in life. In his philosophy, a humble, simple, modest and submissive life ultimately leads to fulfilment.\n3. E. Souvestre, Un philosophe sous les toits. New edition. Paris 1867, pp. 55-57 and pp. 8-9 (chapter 4, ‘Aimons-nous les uns les autres’ (Do we love one another?) and chapter 1, ‘Les étrennes de la mansarde’ (The garret’s Christmas gifts). Cf. Pabst, 1988, p. 66.\n4. Based on the last two stanzas of H.W. Longfellow’s ‘Christmas bells’ from the book Flower-de-Luce. See Longfellow 1886-1891, vol. 3, pp. 132-133. In l. 80 Van Gogh wrote ‘In sorrow did I bow’ where the source text has ‘And in despair I bowed’, and in l. 82 he wrote ‘The world is strong’ where the source text has ‘For hate is strong’.\n5. Possibly an allusion to Deut. 12:15 or rhy. ps. 34:11.\n6. To lend Theo some support during his illness, first Mr van Gogh and later Mrs van Gogh went to visit him (FR b2782 and b2786, dated 7 and 23 October 1876).\n7. Excerpt from Henri Conscience, Le conscrit (The conscript). Van Gogh left out several passages. A comparison with the French version in Scènes de la vie flamande (Scenes of Flemish life) by Henri Conscience, translated by Léon Wocquier, first series, new edition, Paris 1864, pp. 187-189 (cf. letter 89) reveals the following changes:\nl. 106 mortel [ mortel, – la haine des hommes peut-être, –\nl. 137 aimer, grandir [ aimer, haïr, grandir\nIt is remarkable that in the preceding quotation from Longfellow Van Gogh replaced the word ‘hate’ and in this quotation avoids the words ‘haine’ (hate) and ‘haïr’ (to hate).\n8. John 17:15.\n9. This most likely refers to Thomas Wallis, son of the art dealer William Henry Wallis. When Van Gogh moved to London in May 1873, he became acquainted with them through his Uncle Vincent van Gogh: Uncle Vincent and his wife were staying with the Wallis family, who invited Vincent to dine with them around 18 May 1873 (FR b2630). Vincent could also have met Thomas Wallis at the end of 1873 when the latter visited a number of studios in The Hague, as emerges from letters written by H.W. Mesdag in December 1873. In the period 1861-1900, Goupil maintained close ties with Wallis & Son. See Stolwijk 1998, p. 216; cf. also Bailey 1990, p. 91.\n10. Presumably George R. Reid; see letter 82, n. 7.\n11. This person has not been identified, though the reference is probably to one J. Richardson, called in letter 277 ‘the traveller of the house of G&Co’. Cf. Bailey 1990, p. 91.\n12. Père Lachaise, a famous cemetery in Paris.\n13. Elbert Jan van Wisselingh had received his training at Goupil’s in The Hague (1864-1866) and in Paris (1866-1874). He and the art dealer Daniel Cottier were business partners in London in the years 1874-1882. Their gallery was at 8 Pall Mall. See Heijbroek and Wouthuysen 1999. The windows are located in St Andrew's Church in Owslebury, near Winchester. They were commissioned by William Carnegie, 8th Earl of Northesk, as a memorial to his wife and daughter, who both died before him. Both women are depicted as the Virgin Mary. In the family scrapbook of the earl’s descendants, Max Donnelly found photographs of the designs that Van Gogh had described. See Max Donnelly, ‘“Such a noble face”: Vincent van Gogh, Daniel Cottier and the Northesk memorials’, in Burlington Magazine 153 (2011), pp. 568-571. Ills. 3099-3102 [3099] [3100] [3101] [3102].\n14. Matt. 6:10, Matt. 26:42 and Luke 11:2.\n15. Heb. 11:1. The quotation that Van Gogh saw in the original design was replaced with: ‘Fear not, only believe’. See Max Donnelly, ‘“Such a noble face”: Vincent van Gogh, Daniel Cottier and the Northesk memorials’, in Burlington Magazine 153 (2011), p. 571.\n16. Goupil’s London branch, located at 25 Bedford Street (Strand); see letter 29, n. 3.\n17. The ‘corporation of the city of London’, on the north bank of the Thames, comprises what used to be the ancient city.\n18. Henry William Gladwell’s gallery was located at 20-21 Gracechurch Street.\n19. The Congregational Church at Turnham Green, which was ‘a prefabricated “tin tabernacle” of a type commonly found’ in Chiswick High Road (c. 5 km from Isleworth), opened its doors in September 1875 (see Taylor 1964, p. 420, and cf. letter 95). Van Gogh sketched this church, which no longer exists, in letter 99.\n20. This must refer to St John’s Church in Boston Park Road (opened in 1866), which was located about 1 km north of Van Gogh’s route along Brentford High Street.\n21. Syon Park in Isleworth.\n22. 1 Tim. 1:15.\n23. Ps. 107; Van Gogh omitted the following verses: 3, 8-13, 15, 17-19, 21-22, 23b, 31-40, 41b and 43.\n24. Regarding the quotation of ‘L’Homme... mène’, see letter 35, n. 2.\n25. Taken from Emile Souvestre, Les derniers Bretons (The last Bretons): ‘On connaît la vieille prière du matelot breton: Mon Dieu, protégez-moi, mon navire est si petit et votre mer si grande!’. Paris 1858, part 1, chapter 2, paragraph 2, p. 39 (One knows the old prayer of the Breton sailor: Dear God, protect me, my boat is so small and your sea is so great). For an English translation, cf. letters 96 and 120. Van Gogh also wrote these words in the second poetry album, along with other passages from Souvestre’s book, as well as in Annie Slade-Jones’s visitors’ book. See Pabst 1988, pp. 27, 67.\n26. Taken from H.W. Longfellow, ‘The secret of the sea’, from the book The seaside and fireside:\n‘“Wouldst thou,” – so the helmsman answered,\n“Learn the secret of the sea?\nOnly those who brave its dangers\nComprehend its mystery!”’\nSee Longfellow 1886-1891, vol. 1, pp. 260-262.\n27. Cf. Gen. 35:3, Gen. 43:8 and Song of Sol. 7:12.\n",

      "text": "My dear Theo,\nFew things have given me so much pleasure recently as hearing reports from home just now that greatly reassure me as to their mood.\nSien came to tell me that a package had arrived at my studio and I asked her to go and open it and see what was inside, and if there was a letter to bring it with her. That’s how I know that they’ve sent a whole package with all sorts of clothing, over- and underclothes, and cigars, and 10 guilders were enclosed with the letter.\nI can’t tell you how it affected me, especially now — it’s better than I expected — but they still don’t know about one thing and another. Yet I’m greatly reassured.\nI’m weak and faint, Theo, and I absolutely, absolutely must have rest if I’m to get better, so I welcome everything that means peace.\nBut before I lay here I was worse than now, and the main thing you should know now is that it isn’t bad, and only a short period of treatment here will be needed to get me back on my feet.  1v:2\nI wanted to let you know about Pa and Ma right away because I thought it would please you too.\nSien will probably leave next Monday,1 for I believe that there’s no better place for her than in a hospital now, and she can be admitted around mid-June. But now she wanted to stay for my sake, but I don’t want that.\nI have my perspective books2 here and a few volumes of Dickens, including Edwin Drood.3 There’s perspective in Dickens too. By Jove, what an artist. There’s no one to match him.\nI hope that lying still for a little may have a good influence on my drawing, because sometimes you see things better when you aren’t able to work on them for a while, and everything seems new and fresh, so to speak, when you come back to it later. The view from the window of the ward is splendid to me: wharves, the canal with potato barges, the backs of houses being demolished, with workers, a bit of garden and in the next, more distant plane the quay with the row of trees  1v:3 and lamp-posts, a complicated court with its gardens, and also all the roofs, all seen in a bird’s-eye view, but made mysterious in the evening and morning above all by the light effect like, for example, a Ruisdael or Vermeer.4\nBut I’m not allowed to draw it, and couldn’t anyway as long as I’m so weak. But despite not being allowed to get out of bed, in the evening I can’t resist going over to look at it.\nWrite to me soon. It was so kind of home and gave me so much pleasure, especially now.\nThe rest is doing me so much good and making me much calmer and taking away the nervousness I’ve suffered from so much recently. And here in the ward it’s no less fascinating for me than the 3rd-class waiting room. But I may not and cannot draw just yet.\nAdieu, I hope you’ll write to me. Believe me\n\nEver yours,\nVincent",

      "text": "My dear Theo,\nThanks for your letter, thanks for the enclosure. Now listen here.\nWhat you write is all very well and good, and as far as fuss is concerned I’m beginning to be a bit better prepared to forestall it than before. No fear that Pa and Ma will leave, for instance. Although a call came just now.1 On the contrary, if they set about it the right way, Pa and Ma will be able to consolidate their position here.\nNow there are people who say to me, ‘what were you doing getting involved with her?’ — that’s one fact. Now there are people who say to her, ‘what were you doing getting involved with him?’ — that’s a second fact. Apart from that, both she and I have sorrow enough and trouble enough — but regret — neither of us. Look here —\nI \tcertainly \tbelieve \tor \tknow \tfor \tsure \tthat \tshe \tloves \tme,\nI believe her that has been sincere — has it also been crazy — etc.? Perhaps it has, if you like, but the wise people who never do anything that’s crazy, aren’t they even crazier in my eyes than I in theirs?\nThat can be said against your argument and other arguments.\nI say all this simply by way of explanation, not hostilely or nastily.  1v:2\nYou say you like Octave Mouret, you said you’re like him. Since last year I’ve also read the second volume, in which he pleases me much more than in the first.2\nI recently heard it said that ‘Au bonheur des dames’ wouldn’t add particularly to Zola’s reputation. I find some of the greatest and best things in it. I’ve just looked it up, and I’m copying out a few of Octave Mouret’s words for you.\nYou — haven’t you gone to the Bourdoncle side over the last 1 1/2 years or so?3 Would have done better to stick with Mouret; that was and still is my opinion. Aside from an enormous difference in circumstances, indeed diametrically opposed circumstances, I tend more towards the Mouret direction than you might think — as regards my belief in women and that one needs them, must love them. (Mouret says, ‘in our establishment, we love the customers’.)4\nThink about this — and remember my sorrow about your saying that you had ‘cooled’.5  1v:3\nI repeat more forcefully than ever everything I said by way of bitter warning against the influence of Guizot-ness, as I called it. Why? It leads to mediocrity. And I don’t want to see you among the mediocrities because I have loved you, indeed still love you, too much to be able to bear seeing you numbed.\nI know it’s difficult, I know that I don’t know enough about you, I know that I may perhaps be mistaken. But anyway — just read your Mouret again.\nI mentioned a difference between Mouret and what I should want, and yet the parallels. Look here. Mouret worships the modern Parisian woman — very well.\nBut Millet, Breton, worship the peasant woman with the same passion.\nThese two passions are one and the same.\nRead Zola’s description of women in a room at dusk — women often already past 30, up to 50 — such a sombre, mysterious little corner.6\nI find it magnificent, indeed sublime.\nBut equally sublime to my mind is — Millet’s Angelus,7 that same dusk, that same infinite emotion — or that solitary figure by Breton in the Luxembourg,8 or his Spring.9  1r:4\nYou’ll say that I’m not successful. I don’t care, vanquish or be vanquished,10 in all events one has emotion and motion, and they’re more similar than they appear and are said to be.\nAs regards this woman in question, how it must end remains a mystery to me, but neither she nor I will do anything crazy.\nI fear for her that the old religion will numb and freeze her again11 with that damned icy coldness that has already shattered her once in the distant past to the point of death, long years ago. Oh — I’m no friend of present-day Christianity, even though the founder was sublime — I’ve seen through present-day Christianity only too well. It mesmerized me, that icy coldness in my youth — but I’ve had my revenge since then. How? By worshipping the love that they — the theologians — call sin, by respecting a whore etc., and not many would-be respectable, religious ladies.\nTo the one party, woman is always heresy and diabolical. To me, the opposite. Regards.\n\nYours truly,",

      "text": "Etten, 3/9 1881\n\nMy dear Theo,\nThere’s something on my mind that I want to tell you. Perhaps you already know something about it, and what I’m telling you isn’t news.\nI wanted to tell you that this summer, I’ve come to love Kee Vos so much that I could find no other words for it than ‘it’s just as if Kee Vos were the closest person to me and I the closest person to Kee Vos’. And — I said these words to her. But when I told her this, she replied that her past and her future were all one to her and so she could never return my feelings.\nThen I was in an awful dilemma about what to do, to resign myself to that no, nay, never, or — not yet to regard the matter as over and done with, and to take courage and not give up yet.\nI chose the latter. And until now I haven’t regretted that decision, even though I’m still confronted with that no, nay, never.\nSince then, of course, I’ve suffered a great many ‘petty miseries of human life’, which, if they were written down in a book, could perhaps serve to amuse some people, though they can hardly be considered pleasant if one experiences them oneself. Nonetheless, up to now, I’ve been glad that I left the resignation or ‘how-not-to-do-it’ method3 to those who prefer it and, as for myself, plucked up a little courage. You understand that in cases like this, it’s surprisingly difficult to know what one can, may and must do. But ‘wandering we find our way’,\nand not by sitting still.  1v:2\nOne of the reasons I haven’t written to you about it before now is that the position in which I found myself was so vague and undecided that I couldn’t explain it to you.\nNow, though, we’ve progressed to the point where I’ve spoken about it — in addition to her — to Pa and Ma, to Uncle and Aunt Stricker5 and to Uncle and Aunt at Princenhage.6 The only one who said to me, though very informally and in private, that I did indeed have a chance if I worked hard and prospered, is one from whom I didn’t expect it at all, Uncle Cent. He was amused at the way I took Kee’s no, nay, never, i.e. by making light of it and sort of joking about it, bring no grist to Kee Vos’s mill of no, nay, never, for example, I wish her all good things, apart from hoping that the aforementioned flour-mill will go bankrupt. Likewise I didn’t much mind when Uncle Stricker said there was a danger I ‘would sever friendly relations and break old ties’, to which I replied that in my opinion the case in question, far from breaking old ties, could renew the old ties where they were in need of repair. At any rate, I hope to go on like this and to keep well away from melancholy and pessimism. Meanwhile working hard, and since meeting her my work is going much better.\nI said that now the situation is becoming somewhat clearer. First, Kee says no, nay, never, and furthermore I believe that I’ll have tremendous difficulty with the elders who already regard the matter as over and done with and will try and force me to give up. For the time being, though, I believe they’ll proceed with caution,  1v:3 keeping me dangling and fobbing me off until Uncle and Aunt Stricker’s big celebration (in December)7 is over. Because they want to avoid scandal. After that, though, I fear that steps will be taken to get rid of me.\nForgive the rather harsh terms I’m using to make my position clear to you. I admit that the colors are a little harsh and the lines are drawn a bit too hard, but it will nevertheless give you a clearer picture of the situation than if I were to beat about the bush. So don’t suspect me of lack of respect for those Elder persons.\nOnly I believe that they’re decidedly against it, and I want to make you see this. They’ll try and see to it that Kee and I can neither see nor speak nor write to one another, just because they understand very well that if we were to see, speak or write to one another there would be a chance of a change of heart in Kee. Kee herself thinks she‘ll never change her mind and, though the elder persons are trying to convince me that she can’t change, they fear that change nonetheless.\nThe elder persons will change their minds about this matter not when Kee changes her mind but when I become someone who earns at least 1,000 guilders a year. Again, forgive the hard contours with which I outline things. While I find little sympathy from the elders, I think that some of the younger ones will be able to understand my attitude. Perhaps you, Theo. Perhaps you’ve heard it said of me that I want to force the issue and suchlike expressions. But who doesn’t understand how senseless it is to try and force love! No, that’s far, far from my thoughts.  1r:4 But it’s not unfair or unreasonable to wish that Kee and I, instead of not being allowed to see one another, will see, speak and write to one another so that, getting to know each other better, we’ll be able to see for ourselves whether or not we’re suited to each other. A year of contact with one another would be beneficial for her and for me, yet the elders won’t budge on this point. If I were rich they’d talk altogether differently.\nYet by now you understand that I mean to leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to bring me closer to her, and I declare that\n\nI shall love her so long\nThat in the end she’ll love me too.8\n\nThe more she disappears, the more she appears.9\n\nTheo, aren’t you in love too, at times? I wish you were, for believe me, the ‘petty miseries’ of it are also of some value. Sometimes one is desolate, there are moments when one is in hell, as it were, but — it also brings with it other and better things. There are three stages, first not loving and not being loved, second loving and not being loved (the case in question), third loving and being loved.\nI’d say that the second stage is better than the first, but the third! That’s it.\nNow, old boy, go and fall in love and tell me about it sometime. Keep quiet about the case in question and sympathize with me. I’d much rather have a yea and amen, of course, but meanwhile I’m really rather happy with my ‘no, nay, never’. I consider that something, but older and wiser people say it’s nothing. Rappard was here, brought along watercolours that are becoming good. Mauve is coming soon, I hope, otherwise I’ll go to him. I’m drawing a great deal and think it’s getting better, I’m working much more with the brush than I used to. Now it’s so cold that practically all I do is draw figures inside, seamstress,10 basket-maker &c.11\nA handshake in thought, and write soon, and believe me\n\nEver yours,\nVincent",

      "text": "The Hague, Dec. 1881.\n\nMy dear Theo,\nAs you see, I’m writing to you from The Hague. I’ve been here since last Sunday. As you know, Mauve had planned to come and stay in Etten for a few days.1 I was afraid nothing would come of it or that it would be all too short and thought, I’ll go and try it another way, and if possible deal with it somewhat more drastically. I spoke to Mauve and said, would you approve if I were to come and trouble you for a good month or so – then when that time is up I’ll be past the first petty vexations of painting and will go back to Het Heike.\nWell, Mauve immediately installed me in front of a still life consisting of a couple of old clogs and other objects, and so I could set to work.2\nAnd I also go to him in the evenings to draw. I’m staying near Mauve in a small boarding-house where I pay 30 guilders a month for bed and breakfast.3 So if I count on the 100 francs from you then I can manage. And Mauve gives me hope that I’ll be making something saleable quite soon. Anyway, Mauve said, ‘I always thought you were a bloody bore, but now I see that this isn’t so’, and I can assure you that these plain-spoken words from M. give me more satisfaction than a whole cartload of Jesuitical compliments would give me.  1v:2 Mauve may write to you himself soon.\n‘Meanwhile’ I’ve been to Amsterdam.4 J.P.S. was rather angry, although he expressed it in more polished words than God damn you. But all the same, I don’t regret my visit there.\nWhat to do now – because I must tell you that I didn’t return less in love than I went.\nNot because she encouraged me, though. On the contrary, for a moment or rather 24 hours or so she made me extremely miserable. But on reflection, I thought I’d noticed from a certain something that ‘things are progressing anyway’. On reflection, I say, reflecting on more than things romantic and sentimental.\nBut it’s becoming less and less like ‘picking strawberries in the spring’5 — so much the better – the ‘strawberries’ will crop up later in their own good time!\nI also went briefly to see Willemien, who looks well and healthy and cheerful. What a sweet girl she’s becoming, or rather is.6  1v:3\nI’ve also been to see Mr Tersteeg and of the painters I’ve met (the merry) Weissenbruch7 and Jules Bakhuyzen and De Bock.\nIn short, Theo, every day I’ll become more of a realist in all things, I think. She, thank God, is also something very real.\nWell, I send you regards, also from Mauve and Jet, and believe me,\n\nEver yours,\nVincent",

      "text": "My dear Theo,\nOne phrase in your letter of 6 Nov. is worth a special reply.\nYou say: in the present situation I shouldn’t give up hope if I were you, but let the affair rest completely for the people who have nothing to do with it. That course of action, it seems to me,1 ‘will then surprise several people who are now interfering a great deal and will disarm them, as it were’. If, more than once before this, I hadn’t already found this tactic to be one of the best weapons, you would have told me something new. Now, though, I can only say, yes, that much I knew, but now, after that, what else do you know? Because you mustn’t forget that there are situations in which remaining defensive isn’t always enough. Especially not when the opposition’s battle-plan is based on the somewhat rash assumption that waiting defensively is probably the most I can do. If you, Theo, were in love and felt the same kind of love as I do, and why, old chap, would you feel any other kind? – then you would discover something completely new in yourself. The likes of you and I, who mostly associate with men and pursue business2 interests of one kind or another, you in a big way and I in a small way, well, we’re used to doing what we do with our heads – with a certain discretion, with a certain shrewd calculation – but just fall in love, and lo and behold you’ll discover to your amazement that there’s another power that urges us to action, namely feeling.\nWe’re sometimes inclined to mock it a little... but all the same it’s a mistake to think that the man is mistaken who says, especially in matters of love: I don’t go to my head to ask my duty, in this case I go to my heart.3 He who shrugs his shoulders or shakes his head at this, I wish him happiness with his shoulder-shrugging and head-shaking, but I don’t let him upset me, and I doubt if he knows what love is.  1v:2\nNow I don’t really believe that you would wish me to view either my parents or her parents as people ‘who have nothing to do with it’ etc. On the contrary, I refuse to think that it would be unnecessary to talk to them occasionally about this and that.\nEspecially when their inclination is neither positive nor negative, as is actually the case now, meaning not doing anything plainly for or against it.\nWhich is an attitude that, I fear, will cause them much dissatisfaction and indecisiveness and a kind of heartache (something between remorse and no remorse), certainly giving no satisfaction. How they can stand this I cannot comprehend (it’s like something neither cold nor hot, and that has something miserable about it). They have a kind of chronic anguish of spirit4 that never comes to a crisis. They cannot come to a crisis, nor to deliverance. They put water in their wine and wine in their water.\nThey take a step forwards, but, fearful of the consequences, they retreat; they take a step backwards, but then, too, something gnaws at them. There’s something fatal about that as well. They trust and they distrust. What to do? Be half-hearted! How pathetic you make a person! It’s a difficult position for me, for I can say nothing but Onward!\nIf I myself were undecided, hesitant, vacillating, I could accept Pa and Ma’s attitude. Now, though, things are completely different. This love of mine has made me choose sides, and I feel energy, new wholesome energy in me, as anyone experiences who truly loves.  1v:3\nIf Pa and Ma were unenergetic by nature, I’d resign myself to it, but if they wanted to, we could do a great deal that now cannot be done, and that’s why I can’t reconcile myself to it by any means.\nIn short, it’s a peculiar difficulty, and to the best of my ability I’ll make the most of the existing situation anyway. Will Pa and Ma never make up their minds! Will they remain neither hot nor cold for ever and ever! If I ask them, you’re in favour of it, aren’t you? Then they say neither yes nor no, and guard against committing themselves. If I say, but no, you’re against it! Then they say: how could you think such a thing of us!\nMy dear Theo, may I ask you if in fact you aren’t almost of the same mind as Pa and Ma, whose feelings I tried to define in the above lines? And if this should be your frame of mind, though I hope I’m mistaken about this, then I’d just like to say to you: Friend, I believe that you don’t love a girl and... yet... think of love......... If you were to have a positive outcome... then – then – you would truly know how strange an attitude of neither for nor against is, and why someone who’s in love has this advantage over you (if indeed you don’t love), that he can see inside you but you can’t see inside him.\nDo you know why it is, Theo, that Pa and Ma are neither for nor against, neither hot nor cold, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied? This is why, because they know what love is, but through some mental obscurement or other can’t recall it and – and – and – something is sleeping in them that must awaken. I’d like it to awaken fairly soon, it’s been idling for so long already. It’s as though they’ve taken quite a large dose of laudanum,5 they’re awake on the outside but the actual spirit is sleeping SOUNDLY.—.—.—  1r:4 Oh how much precious time this is possibly wasting! But no, I don’t want to think like that. Naturally I’d wish that Pa and Ma see ardency of spirit, positively for it!\nBut if I don’t see this – will my love be cooled by a couple of buckets of cold water? No, that won’t affect it one way or the other.\nIf you would rather that I count you among the people ‘who have nothing to do with it and for whom I should let the matter rest completely’, then I’d nevertheless talk about it occasionally against your will and, you see, that’s what it’s like now with Pa and Ma and Uncle and Aunt Stricker, exactly the same.\nAnd to her??? Yes..... Can one love like I love and... in vain??? I mean... no... — God forbid.\nAs far as Pa and Ma are concerned, I think they’d much rather that I didn’t talk to them about it, and yet I speak of it now and then against their will. Why?... to see if something is awakening. What?... The awareness that there is love, thank God, and that we, old or young, must feel its warmth and see its light. When I told Pa about it this summer – he interrupted me with an anecdote about someone who had eaten too much and another who had eaten too little, completely out of place, and it was an anecdote with neither head nor tail, which made me think, not without a shudder, is Pa in a muddle?\nThis was perhaps from nervousness, because he hadn’t expected it – and yet it was before his very eyes, as it were, that she and I had spent days and weeks walking and talking with each other. Are those eyes of Pa and Ma all-seeing in their present frame of mind? I think not. The man whom the sight of true, serious love leaves neither hot nor cold has either been stunned in some way or he isn’t worth the leather his shoes are made of, in my opinion.  2r:5\nSo what I want to say, brother, is neither more nor less than that I firmly believe that a man, no matter who he be, is unaware of something very special, a great, hidden power, hidden deep inside him, until sooner or later he’s awakened by a meeting with someone of whom he says ‘she and no other’.6 And also that I think that someone like you who doesn’t yet say, she and no other, does well to be on the qui vive for things that can sometimes paralyze, either completely or partially, the aforementioned great, hidden power before it awakens. Have you never done anything that could have a rather fatal influence on the development of that power that one calls love?\nIn my opinion, to some extent. How? I’ll tell you to the best of my ability. Thinking you had to do it, you have perhaps fuelled the ambition in yourself a bit too much, and it’s become a passion in you like a fire. More tender feelings have suffered from it. That’s your case. How do I know this? Do I have grounds for my assertion? Or am I tilting at windmills? How can one know whether or not someone has ambition? (I mean ambition that’s like a fire.) One can tell from two things, first when one catches the patient suffering from the illness. Second when one notices the lack of love, or contentment with love that is wholly deficient. Please don’t get all too angry now, but count to 10 or 20 or 30, slowly and calmly, if I make it sound too bad. But if I didn’t tell you what I have to tell you, who would? It’s bad enough to tell someone: you don’t love, or you’re contented with insufficient love. But to hold one’s tongue when one has something practical to say about it is possibly a great deal worse. At any rate, I’ll now venture to continue. If a man doesn’t have less avarice and ambition than love there’s something wrong with that man, in my opinion. If a man has only love and isn’t able to earn any money, there’s also something the matter with him.  2v:6\nAmbition and avarice is a partnership inside us, very hostile to Love. Those two powers are in all of us, in seed or bud, from the beginning. Later in life they usually develop in unequal proportion, in one love, in the other ambition and avarice. But now we, you and I, at our present ages, can to some extent do something ourselves one way or another to keep the things inside us in order.\nI maintain that love, if it develops, fully develops, produces people of better character than the opposing passion Ambition & Co.\nBut precisely because love is so strong, we are, especially in our youth (I mean now, 17, 18, 20 years old), usually not strong enough to maintain a straight course.\nThe passions are the ship’s sails, you see. And someone of 20 who gives himself over completely to his feelings catches too much wind and his boat fills with water and – and he founders or..... he surfaces again.\nOn the other hand, someone who hoists the sail of Ambition & Co. and none other, sails through life on a straight course without mishap, without rocking the boat until – until at last – at last circumstances arise in which he notices, I don’t have enough sail – then he says, I would give everything, everything I have, for one more square metre of sail and I don’t have it! He despairs.\nOh! But now he realizes that he can bring other powers to bear – he thinks about the sail of love, scorned until today, which until now he has stowed with the ballast. And this sail saves him. The sail of love must save him, if he doesn’t hoist it he won’t make it.  2v:7\nThe first case, that of the man whose little boat capsized in his 20th year or thereabouts and perished, did it not? – or no – surfaced again recently – is actually that of your brother V. who writes to you as one:\n\n‘who has been down but yet came up again’.\n\nThe second case, that of the man who said ‘everything, everything I have for one more square metre of sail’ and he didn’t have it – and yet and yet... he has it! – that’s actually the position of my brother Theo perhaps.\nWhat kind of love did I have in my 20th year?7 Difficult to define, my physical passions were very weak then, perhaps owing to a couple of years of dreadful poverty and hard work. But my intellectual passions were strong, and by that I mean that I was determined, without asking anything in return or accepting any favours, only to give but not to receive.\nAbsurd, wrong, exaggerated, haughty, arrogant. For in matters of love one mustn’t only take but also give, and conversely, not only give but also take.\nHe who turns aside to the right hand or to the left8 falls, there is no mercy for him. So I fell, and it was a miracle that I found my footing again.\nWhat gradually set me to rights, more than anything, was reading practical books about physical and moral diseases. I learned to look more deeply into my own heart and also into that of others. Gradually I began to love people again, myself included, and with each passing day I regained a little heart and spirit which for a time had been destroyed and withered and devastated, so to speak, by all manner of great misery.  2r:8\nAnd the more I returned to real life and was among people, the more new life awoke in me until finally I met her.\nIt is written, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.9 One can turn aside to the right or to the left, and that’s just as bad.\nIt seems to me, exchanging everything for everything is the real, true thing, that’s it, and now both extremes, first asking everything without giving anything, second asking nothing and giving everything.\nTwo wholly – fatal – bad things. Both damned bad.\nNaturally there are those who praise one or other of these extremes to a greater or lesser extent, the first supplies us with those members of society one calls scoundrels, thieves &c., usurers &c., for instance, the second supplies us with Jesuits and Pharisees, male and female, scoundrels all of them!\nIf you tell me to ‘take care not to become too fond of that no, nay, never’ and by that you mean, take care not to give everything and take nothing, then you’re perfectly right about that, and if you tell me that then I’ll say in return that I once made such a mistake. I gave up on a girl and she married someone else, and I went far away from her and kept her in my thoughts anyway. Fatal.\nBut, having become a little wiser after learning the hard way, I now say: we’ll just see whether, far from merely resigning ourselves, we can’t achieve, by means of tireless, patient energy, an outcome that will give us a deal more pleasure. We’ll use all of our common sense to thaw that no, nay, never.10  3r:9\nTheo, to prove to you that I can reason calmly, even though I love, I’ll tell you the following.\nIf she and I were of a sentimental nature and weak of heart, then we’d have taken each other already and reaped much misery from it later. Much poverty, hunger, cold, sickness, among other things, but oh we’d nonetheless have done better to take each other than not to take each other.\nIf wild passion urged me on and she gave in to it, then that passion would cool and my morning-after would be desolation and hers a broken heart.\nIf she were a coquette and played with a man’s heart and the man didn’t see her coquetry, that man would be a fool but a sublime fool, if a fool can in fact be sublime, which I don’t really believe. If I ran after her with ulterior motives, money, for example, or lust, and thought, she can’t escape me for this or that reason, I would be the damnedest of all Jesuits and Pharisees (may I ‘meanwhile’11 tell you that it isn’t like that between her and me).\nIf we were to play at being brother and sister we’d be acting like children, and that would be out of place.\nIf I thought that the key to the front door also unlocked the heart of the woman who’s in that house, and that whether or not that woman’s heart opened or closed depended on that front door and that same key, then I’d be more fearful of the Rev. Dr J.P.S. than is now the case.12\nIf she were never, ever to respond to my feelings of love, then I would probably become an old bachelor.  3v:10\nIf I saw that she loved another man I would go away, far away. If I saw that she took a man she didn’t love because he was rich, I would admit I was wrong and ask forgiveness for my short-sightedness, and I would say, I’ve taken a painting by Brochart for one by Jules Goupil, a fashion plate for a figure by Boughton, Millais or Tissot.13 Am I as short-sighted as that???14 Surely my eye is, like yours, fairly steady and practised.\nBut if she and I stand up to a new life with renewed energy, then the future is not dark.\nIf she with her lady’s hand and I with my draughtsman’s fist are willing to work, we won’t be short of our daily bread, nor will her boy.\nIf I hadn’t been whole-hearted when proposing to her, she’d have despised me, and now she doesn’t despise me.\nIf I didn’t believe that God can and does work miracles in this our daily life, her no, nay, never would already have made me desperate. But now that I believe in such miracles and expect such miracles and trust in and pray to the God that works them and don’t resign myself but act forcefully, God will have mercy on me and and –\n\nKee Vos’s no, nay, never will thaw.\n\nI’ll see that miracle, and you will too.  3v:11\nIf we could no longer rise above earlier mistakes and faults, then you and I would be lost men. Because, however, either in our human nature or in God, call it what you will, there is ‘mercy, that he may be feared’,15 so there is redress of many a past and, ’tis never too late to mend, never too soon either, though.16\nI must remain in the love of Kee Vos.\nYou must also hoist a ‘she and no other’ sail. And then our future will be better than our past. Look, you lucky dog, maybe I’m the only one who doesn’t find your past so very good and tells you so – and my criticism is ‘hasn’t loved enough’, have many others dared say that to you? Your remedy, like mine, ‘Love on! And no time to lose’. Even being a little in love is — and you’re right about this — as you say in your letter, having something good at bottom.\nBut, dear brother, that’s wholly inadequate. The bottom must be good,17 and that’s something completely different. Theo, when you’ll say a heartfelt ‘she and no other’, then I believe that the foundation is good, but before that time I see only something good at bottom.\nNow, though, my third sheet of paper is nearly full, and I still have something to ask you. Old chap, I must see her face again and speak to her and plumb the depths of the no, nay, never. If I don’t do it soon, something might happen at the big celebration18 that could do me much harm.  3r:12 Don’t ask me to be more specific. If you were in love yourself, you would understand, but because you’re not in love yourself I wouldn’t be able to explain it to you.\nTheo, I do need money to travel to Amsterdam. Even if I have only a bit of travelling money, I’ll go. Pa and Ma have promised not to oppose it, provided it has nothing to do with them, as it were.\nI rather understand that in the circumstances. If you, brother, would care to send me some travelling money, I’ll make you a great many drawings of Het Heike and lots of other places. And they wouldn’t be any the worse if the no, nay, never began to thaw. Because the best means to go on drawing is to go on loving.\nWould you be able to help me out with the travelling expenses, old chap? Even if it’s only 20 francs, perhaps I’ll get another 10 from Pa (‘leaving him out of it, as it were; turning a blind eye’) and then i’ll clear off with no time to lose. do you understand, my dear fellow! Believe me always\n\nEver yours.",

      "text": "Dear brother,\nTo Theo van Gogh. Etten, Thursday, 10 or Friday, 11 November 1881.\nI received your letter but think that it’s only an answer to my no. 1.1\nIn no. 2 and no. 32 you obviously found ‘a rebuke’ as thanks for your advice: ‘be careful not to indulge too much in idle fancies before you know for sure that it isn’t a futile undertaking’.\nBecause you’ve already had to swallow that rebuke anyway, I won’t repeat it. Much good may it do you, old boy! Fortunately for you, at least you haven’t committed a ‘meanwhile!!!’ yet, eh?3 No, neither you nor I think of meanwhile, you and I, we don’t know any better than to think that someone who has no courage or refuses to commit himself or wouldn’t dare risk his life with a smile would do better not to occupy himself with winning a real woman’s heart.\nFrom the beginning of this love I’ve felt that unless I threw myself into it unreservedly, committing myself to it whole-heartedly, fully and forever, there would be absolutely no chance for me, and if I’ve thrown myself into it in the above-mentioned way, that doesn’t alter the fact that the chance is very small. But does it matter to me if the chance is larger or smaller? I mean, must I, can I, take that into account when I love? No — no thought to the winnings — one loves because one loves.\nTo love — what a business!\nJust imagine what a real woman would think if she noticed that someone proposed to her, refusing to commit himself — wouldn’t she say something worse to him than ‘no, nay, never’? Oh Theo — let’s not talk about it, if you and I love then we love, that’s all there is to it.\nAnd then we keep a clear head and don’t cloud our minds nor restrain our feelings nor quench the fire and the light — but say simply, thank God — I love.\nWhat, moreover, would a real woman think of a lover who came to her feeling certain of his success? I wouldn’t give tuppence for his result with someone like Kee Vos, and not for a hundred thousand more would I trade his result with the present no, nay, never.  1v:2\nI’ve sent you a few drawings because I thought, perhaps he’ll find something of Het Heike in them.4\nTell me now why they’re unsaleable; how could I make saleable ones?\nBecause I’d like to earn some travelling money now and then to go and plumb the depths of the no, nay, never.\nYou mustn’t inform the Rev. Dr J.P.S.5 of my intentions! Because if I come very unexpectedly it’s possible he won’t be able to do anything but turn a blind eye to it for the sake of peace and quiet.\nSuch a man as the Rev. Dr J.P.S. becomes a completely different person if you love his daughter than he was before then, in the mind of the person concerned with ‘the case in question’. He then becomes quite gigantic and takes on unheard-of proportions! All the same, if one loves his daughter one is more afraid of not going to him than of going to him, even though one knows he can do terrible things in the circumstances.\nAnyway — these days I really feel: ‘I have a draughtsman’s fist’, and I’m very glad to possess such an instrument, even though it’s still rather awkward. The Ingres paper is excellent.\nAnd so you’re popularly known as the lucky dog. Also a petty misery of human life.6 And you doubt whether or not you really are. But what reason do you have to doubt it?\nThat’s what I’d like to know, you see. What kind of petty miseries do you have? Some I know partly or wholly, others not at all.\nDo you also have petty miseries involving a lady now and then? Naturally, but I’d like to hear what manner of miseries. Surely nothing like no, nay, nevers?\nOr, conversely, too many depressing yea and amens perhaps? Well, your petty miseries with the ladies interest me very much. Especially because I think the same about your petty  1v:3 miseries as I do about my own, namely that in many cases they’re due to our lack of understanding, but that they actually contain hidden treasure, provided we know how to find and secure it.\nThose petty miseries, or great ones, are riddles; looking for the solution — that’s certainly worth the effort.\nA lucky dog who complains — without reason!\nAnd they call me ‘the gloomy one’ and I ask you to congratulate me on a no, nay, never.\nAnd get very angry if people tell me that it’s dangerous to sail at sea and remark that one might drown; I don’t get angry because I think they’re wrong in saying so, but because they seem to forget ‘that there is safety in the very heart of danger’.7 So there, lucky dog. What’s wrong with your happiness? You certainly know how to say very piquantly what it’s like to fall in love by comparing it to the strawberry.\nIt’s very nicely put but — being in love with a triple no, nay, never staring you in the face, and moreover a Rev. Dr J.P.S. who demands means of subsistence in the ‘case in question’, that’s what the Rev. calls it, or rather doesn’t even demand them because he (also being a Philistine8 in the field of art) thinks there aren’t any. Being in love like that, I say, isn’t exactly like picking strawberries in the spring.9 And that no, nay, never isn’t as balmy as a spring breeze but as bitter, bitter, bitter as a biting winter frost. ‘This is no flattery’, Shakespeare would say.10 Samson, though, says somewhere else\n\nAnd out of the strong came forth sweetness.11\n\nBut it’s very questionable whether Samson wasn’t a lot wiser than I am. He boldly took on a lion and got the better of it,12 but — will we be able to do that too?\nYou must be able to, Samson would say, and rightly so. Enough, the strawberry season hasn’t arrived yet; I do see strawberry plants but they’re frozen. Will spring come and thaw them and will they blossom and then — then — who will pick them?  1r:4\nThis no, nay, never has, however, taught me things I didn’t know, first brought home to me the full measure of my ignorance, and second that there’s a woman’s world, and much, much more.\nAlso that there are means of subsistence. I would certainly find it considerate of people if they said (as the constitution says, everyone is presumed innocent until proved guilty)13 that people saw one another as having a means of subsistence until the opposite had been proved. One could say: this man exists — I see him, he speaks to me, proof of his actual existence is even that he is not uninvolved in a certain case, for example, ‘the case in question’. His existence being clear and obvious to me (being aware that the person in question isn’t merely a spirit but also has real live flesh and bones), I wish to take it as axiomatic that he owes that existence to means of subsistence, that he obtains them in one way or another and that he works for them. Thus I don’t wish to suspect him of existing without means of subsistence. People don’t reason like this, though, especially not the certain person ‘in question’ in Amsterdam. They must see the means of subsistence to believe in the existence of the person in question, but the existence of the person in question doesn’t prove to them his means of subsistence. Well, this being so, we must first hold a draughtsman’s fist before his eyes, not to attack him with it, though, or even to threaten him. We then have to use that draughtsman’s fist as best we can.\nBut this in no way solves the riddle of no, nay, never. Trying the exact opposite of some advice often proves both practical and satisfying. That’s why in many cases it’s so useful to ask for advice. Even so, there’s advice that’s usable in its natural condition and doesn’t need to be turned inside out or upside down. This latter kind is, however, very rare and desirable, because it has special qualities. The former can be had ten for a penny. The latter is dear, the former costs nothing and is sometimes delivered, unasked-for, by the barrelful. ‘Meanwhile’!!!\n\nYours truly,\nVincent.\n\n 2r:5\nI’m closing this letter with a bit of advice in return. If you ever love, don’t refuse to commit yourself, or I’d rather say, if you ever love, you won’t think of not committing yourself. Furthermore, if you love, you won’t ‘feel certain’, beforehand, that you’ll succeed — you’ll be ‘a soul in need’14 and yet you’ll smile.\nHe who feels ‘sure of what he’s doing’ in the sense that he prematurely imagines that ‘she’s mine’, before he fights the inner battle of loving, before, I say, he sails the high seas in storm and tempest, hovering between life and death — he knows too little what a real woman’s heart is, and it will be driven home to him by a real woman in a very special way. When I was younger I once half-imagined that I loved, while the other half truly loved, the result being many years of humiliation. May I not then have been humiliated too much in vain.15  2v:6\nI speak as one ‘who has been down’,16 from bitter experience, having learned the hard way.\nLucky dog! What’s the matter? What aileth thee!17\nPerhaps you haven’t really been a lucky dog until now, but I maintain that you’re well on the way to becoming one.\nI gather this from the tone of your letters. It’s as though there’s a hair in your throat, in your voice. What kind of hair is it? Couldn’t you tell me about it sometime, now that I’ve told you so much? Theo, all fathers with daughters have an object one calls the key to the front door. A very terrifying weapon, which can open and close the aforementioned front door as Peter and Paul the gates of heaven.18 Well, does that implement fit the hearts of their respective daughters ‘in question’ at the same time? Do they open or close with the front door key? I think not, only God and love are capable of opening or closing a woman’s heart. Will hers open up? Brother, will she ever let me in? God knoweth.19 I don’t know such things in advance.\n",

Africa, south America, auks andHew Zealand in the supercontinent Gondwana. Ten million years later, Gondwana began the enormously slow process of breaking into the pieces we recognize today, and the continents, subcontinent and islands began moving into their present positions. By about 70 million years ago, the continents were becoming widely separated and what is now known as the Drake Passage opened. After making its final detachment from the Australian continent, about 40 million years ago, Antarctica settled into its present polar position and began to cool dramatically.\nAmong the fossil evidence found in Antarctica that dearly supports the supercontinent theory is a deciduous conifer (Glossopteris), a fern (Dicroidium) and a terrestrial reptile (Lystrosaurus).AllofthesespecieslivedonGondwanaandtheirfossilremainshavebeenfoundinrocksofthesameageinsuchwidelyseparatedlocalesashaq,aostsAmniss Australia, Africa and Antarctica. Because Glossoptede seeds and Dicroidium's spores could not have been blown, and Lystrasaurus could not have swum across the oceans that separate these continents, their fossilized remains otter certain proof that the continents were all once united.\nContents\nThe ancients The exelOrent\nThe sealers Dellinashausen\ngranSfictift Palmer\nBiscoe\nWilkes\nDumont d'urville Ross\n• Scott's discovery expedition\n• AMU\n• Cheroot\n• ehackinton's Nimrod expedition\n• Amundsen\n• Seed's Terra Nova expedition\n• Shirase\n•Mawson\n• Elicrier\n• Shackleton's endurance expedition • Wilkins\n• Sysil\n• flisworth\n• The contemporary era\n• Operations Hinhiump & Windmill\n• 911112 •internationalGeophysicalYearliGn\ncnJ A\nrk(A?\nLarsen\nBull\nDe Gerlache\nBorcharevink\nDryclalski\nNordensiddid\nThe ancients\nAntarctica, unlike any other continent, was postulated to exist long before it was actually discovered. The ancient Greeks, beginning with Pythagoras in about 530 BC, believed the earth to be round. Aristotle supported and refined the idea, suggesting that the symmetry of a sphere demanded that the earth's inhabited northern region should be balanced by an equally inhabited - or, at least, inhabitable - southern region. Wthout it, the top-heavy globe might tumble over. This idea of earthly balance gave rise to the name we give the southern continent today:Antarktos,or'oppositeArktos,'theconstellationinthenorthernsky.InEmitPtolemyagreedthatgeographicalequilibnumrequiredanunknownsoutherncontinent,buthebelieved theunknownlandwouldbepopulatedandfertile.AmaphedrewcAD150showedalargecontinentlinkingAfricaandMa\nTwo factors conspired, however, against anyone going to look for this mysterious undiscovered continent. First, ancient thinkers as far back as Parmenides (460 BC) believed that between the earth's two temperate regions would be found a zone of fire and perhaps even monsters. This may have been wisdom somehow gleaned from an early traveler who had experienced a tropical summer This torrid zone was thought to be impassable and deadly. If mortal fear was not enough to dissuade would-be discoverers, perhaps eternal damnation did the trick, for the Catholic Church found the idea of a southern continent - with its own population, and thus its own separate relationship with God - unacceptable. The idea that the Creator could possibly have made two sets of humanity was deemed heretical, and the flat-earth theory was given full backing.\nIntrepid voyagers nevertheless pushed back the boundanes of their known worlds. As early as 700 BC, the Greek historian Herodotus records, a Phoenidan fleet sailed from the Red Sea southalongtheAfricancoastandaroundCapeAgulhastotheStraitofGibraftc Thisincrediblevoyagewasnottoberepeatedfornearly2000years.InAD650,accordingtoRarotongan legend, a Polynesian navigator named Uhte-Rangiora sailed so far south that he reached a place where the sea was frozen. These voyages were neither repeated nor widely known. however, and it was not until late in the 15th century that further progress was made on answering the question of Antarctica.\n• Bank to top\nThe explorers\nThe Portuguese made the first important penetrations south, beginning with a naval voyage in 1487-88 led by Bartholomeu Dias de Novaes and Joao Infante, who sailed around the southernbpofVice,CapeAquinas,asfaraspresent-dayMozamblaue.Theirvoyageopenedthewayforanothernavalexpedition,ledbyVascodaGamein1497,todiscovertheway aroundMica tojosat Theseexpeditionsprovedthatiftherewasagreatsoutherncontinent,itwasnotattachedtoAfrica\nLikewise, Portuguese explorer Femao de magalhaes (Ferdinand Magellan), leading the first circumnavigation of the globe from 1519 to 1522. discovered and named Terra del Fuego ('LandofFire,'namednotfortheancients'torridregions,butforthecampfiresbuiltbythenativeWawapeoplethathadbeenspottedonshore).Bysailingthroughthestraitsthatnow bear his name, Magellan proved the southern land was not connected to south Americe either although it remained possible that it was attached to Tierra del Fuego.\nWhat's remarkable about these discoveries is that their makers were disproving rather then proving the existence of a great southern land. Antarctica was a mysterious place whose extent was originally imagined to be enormous: it was thought to cover the whole Southern Ocean and connect to the southern extremes of the known continents. Although each subsequent voyage of discovery pared off great sections of open ocean where Antarctica was obviously not located, few people seemed able to conceive that the continent might not exist at all; instead thebeliefpersistedstronglythatAntarctica-agreatlydiminishedAntarctica,tobesure-mustliejustalittlefurthersouth.Butthe§atInnalm's temfyingstormsandimpenetrable pack ice Conspired to keep the continent's white face shrouded from inquiring eyes for centuries more.\nTerra Australis (Southern Land) - the term was first used by Flemish mapmaker Oronce Fine in 1531 - continued to exert its attraction, however Englishman Francis Drake, sailing in Egq: ma(laternamedGoldenHind),madethesecondcircumnavigationoftheglobefrom1577-80.Drakediscoveredthepassagenownamedforhim,definitivelyprovingthatnosouthern continent was connected to either South America.or Tierra del Fuego. As the sub-Antarctic andpouthem Ocean archipelagoes (the Falklands, South Sandwich Islands, South Georgia, Bouvetaya, lies Kerguelen) were found in succession, some were initially thought to be northerly projedions of Terra Australis, but each eventually proved merely insular.

On his second voyage with the ships, Cook's expedition sailed 109,500km and penetrated further south than anyone before. They crossed the Antarctic Cirde on January 17,1773, becoming the first people to do so, and crossed it twice again without ever sighting land, despite pushing to a record 71°10'S. On their third pass through the pack ice, Cook and his men landed on South Georgia, which he called the isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich islands.\nDespite his remarkable first drcumnavigation of Antarctica - done without losing a single crewmember - Cook failed to find the southern continent itself. It's almost more remarkable that he didn't find Antarctica, given that he managed to get so much further south than anyone before. Cook simply had poor luck, in the longitudes where he managed to penetrate furthest south,\nCiLJ-cd\\Ct:\n4\nuriFt\n'sk 2)\nIJ e\n\n History of Antarctica - Lonely Planet Travel Information\nhttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/antarcticaMistory\n2 of 11\n6/13/2016 12:47 PM\nthe coast of Antarctica itself also swerved southward Upon leaving the frozen southern seas for the last time! Cook wrote:\nThick fogs, Snow storms, Intense Cold and every other thing that can render Navigation dangerous, one has to encounter and these difficulties are greatly heightned by the enexpressable horrid aspect of the Country, a Country doomed by Nature never once to feel the warmth of the Suns rays, but to lie for ever buried under everlasting snow and ice.\nIf there were any remaining doubt how Cook felt about the prospects of a still-undiscovered Antarctica, he later underscored this opinion:\n...whoever has resolution and perseverance to dear up this point by proceeding farther than I have done! I shall not envy him the honour of discovery, but I will be bold to say that the world will not be benefited by it.\nSo convincing were his pessimistic sentiments that Cook discouraged other explorers from seeking the great southern continent for decades afterward. But he also recorded his observations of large numbers of seals and whales - and others, more commercially minded than the Royal Navy, took notice.\nr'211.tc... atopg\nThe Sealers\nDunng the sealing era from about 1780 to 1892, more than 1100 sealing ships visited Antarctic regions (both the pen-Antarctic islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula), compared to barely 25 explorationships.ThesealerscamefromBritain,theCapeColony(nowpartof'GuthAfrica)FranceTasmaniaandNewSouthWales(inpresent-dayAustralia)NewZealandandthe United States. Most were motivated by profit, not discovery, though a few firms, notably Enderby Brothers of London, spent vast sums on exploration\nFur seals have two layers that make up their coats: stiff, outer 'guard hairs' to protect the body when they clamber over rocks, and a dense layer of underfur to trap insulating air bubbles and keep the skin dry Preparing the pelts required the removal of the guard hairs, a technique for many decades known only by the Chinese.\nSealing was an extremely hard life Gangs were typically dropped off on a promising beach and left for months at a time while the ship continued in search of other sealing grounds. The sealers lived in tents, rude huts, or small caves among the rocks. All offered little shelter from the wind and weather\nThe brutality of their work impressed even the sealers themselves 'By having our hands daily imbued in the blood of animals, 'wrote American William Dane Phelps in 1871, 'our natures were so changed, that acts of cruelty, which, one year previous, would have been revolting to us, we now seemed to enjoy...'\nGreed was the watchword as the sealing gangs slaughtered without thought for the future. Captain James W Budington a Connecticut sealer who worked in the Antarctic for more than 20 years, testified to the US Congress in 1892:\nWe killed everything, old and young, that we could get in gunshot of, excepting the black pups, whose skins were unmarketable, and most all of these died of starvation, having no means of sustenance, or else were killed by a sort of buzzard, when the mother seals, having been destroyed, were unable to protect them longer.. The seals in all these localities have been destroyed entirely by this indiscriminate killing of old and young, male and female If the seals in these regions had been protected and only a certain number of 'dogs' (young male seals unable to hold their positions on the beaches) allowed to be killed, these islands and coasts would be again populous with seal life. The seals would certainly not have decreased and would have produced an annual supply of skins for all times As it is, however, seals in the Antarctic regions are practically extinct. and I have given up the business as unprofitable\nAnother Connecticut sealer, George Comer of East Haddam, testified to the Congress in the same year about the enormous waste of life involved in sealing\nIn the first part of a season we never disturbed the rookenes we visited, always letting the seals come onshore, then we would kill them on land with dubs or rifles. During the latter part of a season the seals became very wild, and we used to shoot them in the water from boats. Wien we shoot them in the water, we lose certainly three out of five we kill by sinking, and we also wounded a great many more. Shooting seals in the water d the most destructive method of taking them as compared with the number of skins we have to show for our work\nElephant seals also were hunted for the oil that can be rendered from their blubber rather than for fur, which they lack Elephant seals grow to massive sizes, particularly males, but the sealers found 'sea elephants' easy prey. 'To the skilful hunter their overthrow is but the work of a moment, 'wrote one sealer on Kerguelen: 'He fearlessly approaches the animal in front, and, as it raises the left forepaw to advance upon him, with great address plunges his lance, 10ft or 128 Mm or 3.6m] long, into its heart'\nSealing voyages far outnumbered expeditions that could be called strictly scientific Nearly a third of the pert-Antarctic islands were discovered by sealers. But sealers considered their discoveries proprietary and kept the information to themselves (although drunken sailors were not always able to restrain from boasting about newfound sealing grounds). So it remained for kings, czars and governments to send out exploring expeditions, in hopes of extending their sovereignty over ever-greater empires.\nA\nBellingshausen\nFabian von Bellingshausen (1778-1852), a Baltic German and captain in the Russian Imperial Navy, participated in the first Russian circumnavigation in 1803-06. In 1819 Czar Alexander dispatched Bellingshausen one voyage to the Southern Ocean a dream assignment for Bellingshausen, who had long admired Cook's voyages. ffilth his flagship Vostok (East), a newly launched corvette with a copper-sheathed hull, and the older, sluggish transport ship Mimyy (Peaceful) which constantly slowed the expedition, Bellingshausen sailed from Kronstadt, an island off St Petersburg, in July 1819.\nThe expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle on January 26, 1820, and the next day became the first to sight the Antarctic continent. Through a heavy curtain of falling snow, at 69'21'S, 2°14'W, Bellingshausen saw 'an ffiefield covered with small hillocks.' Not realizing the importance of his discovery, however, he merely noted the weather and position in the ship's log before continuing. The two ships sailed eastward, pushing further south than anyone before, reaching 69°25'S. Eventually they tacked north to escape the oncoming winter, spending four months in the South Pacific in 1820. Turning south again, they crossed the Antarctic Circle six more times, eventually probing as far as 69°53'S, where they discovered Peter I By. the southernmost land known at that time. They also found a second piece of ice-free land south of the Circle, which Bellingshausen called Alexander Coast after the czar It is now known to be an island joined to the Antarctic Peninsula by an ice shelf.\nReturning north through the South Shetlands, Bellingshausen met American sealer Nathaniel Brown Palmer, in Hem, who claimed to know well the coast Bellingshausen had just explored. A legend created by Palmer's biographer, sealer Edmund Fanning. insists that Bellingshausen was so impressed by Palmer's claims of knowledge that he named the new territory after Palmer. But the meticulous Bellingshausen never noted this alleged act in his diaries or charts: the story appears to be fantasy\nDespite Bellingshausen's discovenes - and his duplication of his hero Cook's drcumnaffigation of Antarctica - he returned to Russia to find that his countrymen had little interest in his voyage. It took nearly 120 years and the start of the Cold War before his accomplishments were fully appreoated - by a Soviet Union newly anxious to assert its right to authority in the Antarctic.\n\" Back to top\nSmith\nEnglish merchant Captain Wiliam Smith (1790-1847), sailing in the British ship IMIliams in early 1819, sets course well south of Cape Horn while bound for Valparaiso Chlle probably to avoid difficult winds. He sighted the South Shetlands on February 19, but made no landing Returning eastward from Chile in June, Smith headed south again, reaching 62°S, but this time he was too far west and missed the islands On his third voyage that year, again in ishiliams, Smith landed on King George Island on October 17. He claimed it for George IV, naming it first New South Britain, then New South Shetland The islands were thus the first pan of Antarctica (south of 60°S) to be discovered. On October 18, he sighted the island now named for him (SmithIsland) SmithreturnedtotheislandsagainlaterintheyearwithBransfteld\nBaCk to too\nBransfield\nAlthough Edward Bransfield (01783-1852) was once credited with being first to sight Antarctica, it is now agreed that Bellingshausen beat him to that honor by three days.\nAfterSmithannouncedhisdiscoveryoftheSouthShetlandsin1819,theRoyalNavycharteredhisship,V011iams,tosurveytheislands.BransfieldwasputaboardWiliam,andtheysailed south from Valparaiso Chile. On January 22, 1820, they landed at King George Bay (perhaps at Turret Point) on King George Island and again claimed the islands for Britain. Two months were spent charting the South Shetlands.\nContinuing south, Bransfield sighted the Antarctic Peninsula on January 30, 1820, calling it Trinity Land. One of his midshipmen, quoted in the Literary Gazette and Journal of Belle Lettres, called it 'a prospect the most gloomy that can be imagined the only cheer the Sight afforded was in the idea that this might be the long-sought Southern Continent.' They surveyed the islands along it for another 20 days before being stopped by pack ice and turning north.\n\" Back to top\nPainter\nAmerican sealer Nathaniel Brown Palmer (1799-1877), son of a shipyard owner, left his home of Stonington, Connecticut at age 14 to go to sea On his second sealing voyage to the South Shetlands in 1820, commanding the sloop Hero, Palmer sailed south with a small fleet of other sealers. Hero carried five crewman, including Peter Harvey, born in Philadelphia in 1789, the first recorded black person to reach such a high southern latitude (although there is a good chance that Cook's ships had black crevernembers, since up to 10% of Royal Navy crews of that era were black, with many former slaves remaining aboard their ships).\nStcog\n\n History of Antarctica - Lonely Planet Travel Information http://www.lonelyplanet.com/antarctica/history\nofll\n6/13/2016 12:47 PM\nUpon his amval in the South Shetlands, the need for a more secure anchorage for the five ships drove Palmer to push south ahead of the others. He anchored inside the caldera of Deception Island, almost certainly the first person to do so. On November 16. either from a high lookout at Deception or from Hero's masthead, he saw Trinity Island to the southeast and probably the Antarctic Peninsula beyond. The next day Palmer sated to investigate, but due to heavy ice thought it imprudent to try to land. In later years, Palmer claimed that he had found the Antarctic continent, calling his discovery Palmer Land. But even if he did see Antarctica on that occasion, his sighting came 10 months after Bellingshausen's (January 27) and Bransfield's (January 30) earlier that year Later that summer, in January 1821, while searching for seal rookeqes Palmer took Hero south along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula as far as Marguerite Bay.\nA year later. commanding the sloop James Monroe, calmer was searching for seals in the South Shetlands with British Captain George Powell of Dove. Finding no seals, they steered east, and on December 6 1821, sighted a large island of a new group. Since there were no seals Palmer had no interest in the discovery, but Powell went ashore and claimed it for the Bntish crown, calling it Coronation Island, and the group, 'Powell's Group. ' now known as the South Orkney Islands.\n\" Back to top\nBiscoe\nAnother Briton, John Biscoe (1794-1843), joined the Royal Navy at age 18 and fought in the 1812 war against the US. Dispatched by the London firm of Enderby Brothers in July 1830, he made the third circumnavigation of Antarctica, sailing in the bqg Tula, accompanied by George Avery in the cutter Lively The vessels sighted what they called Enderby Land on February 24, 1831, and confirmed the discovery three days later - the first sighting of the Antarctic continent in the Indian Ocean sector Biscoe was also struck by the beauty of the aurora australis, which, he recorded, 'at times (appeared) not many yards above us: Oncoming winter forced the ships north to Hobart but scurvy so ravaged Tula's crew that only Biscoe, three other men and a boy were able to work Aboard Lively which had become separated from This, all but three of the crew died of scurvy or other diseases.\nSating again with both ships in October 1831, on what was, after all, supposed to be a commercial voyage. Biscoe spent three months searching for whales or seals off New Zealand. Findingnone,heheadedsouthoncemore,sailingeastwardanddiscovenngAdelaideIsland(whichhenamedfortheconsortofKingWiliamIV)onFebruary16,183/Biscoefoundmore land (now thought to be Anvers Island) on February 21, and claimed the territory for King Wiliam IV. Still seeking seals or another valuable cargo, Biscoe was forced to sail for England after This damaged her rudder. (En route home, Lively was wrecked in the Falklands ) Although he returned to London in January 1833 with empty holds and one ship missing, Biscoe was fortunate to have extremely open-minded bosses Instead of reproach, he received the highest award of the newly established Royal Geographical Society.\nAfter Biscoe's return, the coast he discovered was named Graham Land, for James RG Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty Although this was in fact a southern portion of the Antarctic Peninsula, which had already been sighted by Bransfield, Smith and Palmer the name eventually came to be applied to the entire Antarctic Peninsula on Bntish maps, while the name Palmer Land was used by Amencan chadmakers This difference continued until 1964, when the US and the UK agreed to use the name Antarctic Peninsula for the entire northward- reaching extension of the Antarctic continent, with the northern part to be called Graham Land and the southern, Palmer Land.\nBritish discoveries in the Peninsula region had not escaped the attention of the US government. After nearly a decade of being urged to do so, the US Congress voted to send ships south to explore the region.\n\" Back to top\nWilkes\nBy the time American Lieutenant Charles Wilkes (1798-1877) was offered command of the US Exploring Expedition in 1838, the position had been declined by several senior officers. Perhaps they knew something Wilkes didn't, for this inauspicious beginning foretold great hardship for the expedition. In the words of British polar historian Laurence P Kirwan (The White Road, Hollis & Carter. 19591, it was the most ill-prepared, the most controversial, and probably the unhappiest expedition which ever sailed the Antarctic seas '\nFor a start, the six ships selected were ill-suited to polar exploration Warships Vincennes, Peacock and Porpoise had gun ports that admitted heavy seas: Sea Gull and Flying Fish were former New York pilot boats, the sluggish storeship Relief rounded out the sorry fleet As might be expected of an expedition planned by committee, the US Ex Ex, as it became known, lacked focus Antarctica was to be just one area of its endeavor, and a minor one at that Wilkes was also directed to explore the whole of the Pacific, from Chlle to Australia to the northwest coast of North America A jealous Navy Department, meanwhile, did all it could to exclude Civilian scientists from the expedition, though Wilkes did manage to take with him artist Titian Ramsey Peale.\nBy the time the expedition sailed on August 18, 1838, a depressed Wilkes confided to his private diary that he felt 'doomed to destruction.'

The ships soon lost contact with one another, each undergoing its own trials. Gales blew out sails and tangled nggrng, boats were crushed by ice, men were injured and frozen Wilkes himself, in the flagship, narrowly missed running aground on Elephant Island in fog. Sea Gull was lost off Chile with all hands But Peacock and Flying Fish managed to cross the 70th parallel, little more than a degree away from beating Cook's record.\nNow diminished by two (Relief had been sent home as unsuitable for ice work). the expedition reconvened in Sydney in November 1839 after surveying in the South Padfic. After a month's recuperation, the four ships sailed south again on December 26, with Wilkes commanding Vincennes. On board was one of the first recorded canine visitors to the Antarctic, a dog acquired in Sydney and named after that port. Again the ships were quickly separated, and in late February Flying Fish gave up its search for the others and returned to New Zealand alone\nTheotherthreevesselsmanagedtorendezvous,however,andonJanuary16,1840-threedaysbeforeDumontd'Urvillemadehisdiscovery-theysightedlandintheregionof154°30\"E, putting a boat ashore three days later to confirm it Separating again, Vincennes continued west, sighting and charting discovenes until reaching the present-day Shackleton Ice Shelf, which Vtrilkes named Termination Land. The massive ice shelf, which today extends nearly 290km out to sea, convinced him that it was time to head home, which he did on February 21.\nHaving followed the Antarctic coast for nearly 2000km. Wilkes announced the discovery of an Antarctic continent upon his return to Sydney. Later, James Clark Ross, to whom Wilkes gave a manuscript copy of his tradng of the Antarctic coastline, announced that he had sailed over positions Nikes laid down on his chart as land. Ross was equally dismissive ofMikes' claim for an Antarctic mainland, but Wilkes insisted that he had limned a continent.\nSubsequent investigations have proven the accuracy of most of Wilkes-delineation of the Antarctic coastline he followed.

Two long months later, all of the charges against him - save one - were dismissed Found guilty of ordering a too-severe punishment for some thieving seamen. Wilkes was officially reprimanded by the Secretary of the Navy The US Congress, however. handed Wilkes his bitterest defeat, authonzing publication of just 100 copies of the expedition's official report. Today, the full set of the Narrafrve is one of the rarest and most valuable polar books.\nS BacI\nDumont d'urville\nFrenchman Jules-Sebastien-Cesar Dumont d'Urville (1790-1842) was a veteran of two circumnavigations (and fluent in English, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian and Spanish), when he sailed frOM Toulon in 1837 with Astrolabe and Zelee, clad in copper for protection from the ice. Although Dumont d'Urville hoped to reach the South Magnetic Pole - magnetism was then one of screncers hottest questions - his orders from King Louis Philippe were simply to proceed as far south as possible in the Weddell Sea Indeed, the explorers were promised a bonus of 100 gold francs each if they reached 75°S, with another 20 francs for each additional degree gained toward the Pole.\nBut the ice in the Weddell Sea that season extended much further north - its normal configuration - and much to his frustration Dumont d'Urville was unable to penetrate nearly as far south as Weddell. At the end of February he discovered (or rediscovered, since sealers had probably already landed there) Louis Philippe Land and JoinvIlle Island at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. By this time, scurvy plagued his ships; on the return to Terra del Fuego a sailor died of the dreaded disease\nFollowing a year-long ethnological voyage in the Pacific, during which 23 men died of dysentery and fever, Dumont dUrville and his crews headed south again in January 1840. On the 19th, they saw what they felt certain was land, confirmed the next day by a clearer sighting. Unable to go ashore because of massive ice cliffs, they sailed west before coming upon a group of islets just a few hundred meters offshore A party was landed, a few chips of granite hacked off as proof that they had found terra firma, and the discovery claimed for France. An officer who had anticipated success brought out a bottle of Bordeaux and a toast was raised to the King.\nHonoring his wife by naming the new territory for her, Dumont d'Urylle was the only early explorer to so honor his wife, though another Frenchman, Charcot, later followed his example. TerreMariewasDumontd'Urvillewrote,dedicatedto'thedevotedcompanionwhohasthreetimesconsentedtoapainfulseparationinordertoallowmetoaccomplishMyplansfor distant exploration.' The Adele penguin likewise commemorates Madame Dumont d'Urville.\nHeading east in Search of the Magnetic Pole Dumont d'Urville's lookouts were astonished one afternoon to see an American man-of-war emerge from the fog, running before the wind straight toward them. The ship was Porpoise, part of 1Mikes US Ex Ex, but thanks to a misunderstanding, the two vessels did not stop to communicate. Each side later blamed the other for raising sail and blowing past. Returning to France in November 1840 to great acclaim after their 38-month voyage, Dumont d'Urville and his men were rewarded by the French government with 15, 000 francs, to be divided by the expedition's 130 surviving members.\nLess than two years later Dumont d'Urville, his wife, and their son Jules were killed in a train derailment as they returned from Versailles to Paris on May 8, 1842.\n\n gistory of Antarctica - Lonely Planet Travel Information http://www.lonelyplanet.com/antarctica/history\n4 of II\n6/13/2016 12:47 PM\nABackto too\nROSS\nScotsman James Clark Ross (1800-62), considered one of the most dashing figures of his time, had all of the advantages for Antarctic exploration that Wilkes lacked. After joining the Royal Navy at the tender age of 11, Ross went on to a career of Arctic discovery Between 1818 and 1836, he spent eight winters and 15 summers in the Arctic In 1831, as second-in-command of a voyage led by his uncle, John Ross, he located the North Magnetic Pole. In 1839 he was asked to lead a national expedition to explore the south, and if possible, to locate the South Magnetic Pole The contrast between his commission and Wilkes could not have been greater. With his government firmly behind the effort, both philosophically and financially, Ross was given excellent ships, officers and provisions: his sailors were volunteers on double pay\nSailing in September 1839 in Erebus and Tenor, three-masted barques specially strengthened for ice navigation, the expedition stopped in Hobart en route. There, the Governor of Van Diemen'sLand(Tasmania)wasJohnFranklin,himselfaveteranArcticexplorerwhowouldlatersailArcticwatersagain-inthesameErebusandTenor-beforedisappearingand triggering the greatest polar search in history.\nIn Hobart Ross heard troubling news. both Wilkes and Dumont d'urville were exploring the area in which he intended to search for the magnetic pole Ross reacted quickly, changing his plans to a more easterly longitude for the push south\nGoodfortunewaslobeonhisside,althoughtheelementsmadeRossearnit Sailingsouthalongthe170°Emeridian,hepushedthroughpackiceforfourdays.OnJanuary9,1841,he broke through to open water, becoming the first to reach what we know today as the Ross Ice Shelf. The next day. Ross sighted land, an unexpected development. A boat was put ashore two days later on Possession Island, the new territory claimed for Queen Victoria\nRoss' goal, however, was the South Magnetic Pole. which had been calculated to be both north and west of his current position To follow the coast south and eastward would appear to be the 'wrong' way to get there, but to sail west would mean following in the tracks of Wilkes and Dumont dUrville, equally unappealing. Ross may have been thinking of the Arctic islands and channels he knew well: perhaps sailing south and east would reveal a passage back toward the expected pole. So he stayed his course, discovering High (now called Ross) Island, and naming its two mountains - Erebus and Terror - for his ships\nLying in Ross' path, however, was a formidable obstacle, what he called simply 'the Victona Barrier, 'a wall of ice towenng 60m above the sea. It was, Ross wrote, 'a mighty and wonderful object far beyond anything we could have thought or conceived. What was beyond it we could not imagine.' This barrier, today known as the Ross Ice Shelf, also frustrated him' 'We might with equal chance of success try to sail through the Cliffs of Dover, as penetrate such a mass: The two ships cruised along the Berner for 450km, the sailors in awe of its unchanging face, oblivious to even the most gigantic wave crashing against it After calculating on January 22,1841 that he had surpassed Weddell's furthest south, Ross turned for Hobart.\nSailing south again in November 1841. Ross aimed for the eastern extremity of the Barrier, reaching a new record south of 713°10'S on February 23. After surviving a horrifying storm among ice fragments as 'hard as floating rocks of granite' that nearly destroyed the rudders of both ships, they met an even greater hazard\nThe two ships barely missed catastrophe on March 13, 1842 when, traveling together in darkness after midnight, they were blown by a gale into a group of icebergs. To avoid instant collision with one of the bergs, each ship put the helm over hard, but they crashed into one another. Rising on an enormous wave, Terror landed on Erebus, breaking away Erebus' bowsprit, foretopmast, booms, yards and stays\nOne of Erebus' anchors was dnven right though the hull's copper sheathing into the side of the ship. 'If both Ships was forty Seconds Longer in contact They would Gow down together and no Person would live to tell the tale, 'wrote one of Erebus' crew When they separated, each ship still faced great danger: Erebus, now just 8m from the giant berg, somehow managed to slip past. Tenor likewise narrowly avoided collision with the floating mountain.\nFollowing this unnerving crash, the ships again reached the Berner. It appeared to join a range of mountains, but winter's onset forced a retreat. Ross' third season was equally disappointing: trying to best Weddell's southing record in Weddell's namesake sea. Ross found conditions similar to those encountered by everyone but Weddell He was forced to head home after reaching 71°30\"S.\nThe expedition reached England on September 2, 1843, after nearly WA years away. When Ross married later that year, his bride Anne's father set one condition: he must promise to end his explonng days, a pledge Ross made and faithfully kept - with one exception. In 1847-48 he returned to the Arctic to search for John Franklin, who had disappeared after sailing in Ross' old ships Erebus and Terror in 1845 to try to navigate the Northwest Passage.\nAfter Ross' important discovenes, Antarctica was once again ignored by the rest of the world, which was distracted by things such as the slave trade and the Crimean War \" Back to top\nLarsen\nNorwegian Carl Anton Larsen (1860-1924) went to sea at age 14, and at 25 became master of his first whaling ship. Later, he sailed in Jason on the same voyage that named Fridtjof NansentoGreenlandforhisfamouseast-westcrossingin1888 WhalingentrepreneurChristenChristiansendispatchedLarseninJasonin1892tosearchforwhalesintheAntarctic.In 1893, having found fur and elephant seals, but no whales of any species that he could catch, Larsen returned home. He went south again independently later that year. this time with twee ships: Jason, e wine and Castor. The expedition explored both coasts of the northern Antarctic Peninsula, discovered Oscar 11Land and made the first use of skis in Antarctica. Larsen also found petrified wooden Seymour Island kle went on to captain Nordenskjeld's Antarctic in 1991, and to establish South Georgia's Grytviken whaling station, Antarctica's first, in 1904\n\" Back to top\nBull\nNorwegian-born Henrik Johan Bull (1844-1930) traveled to Australia in 1885 and set himself up in business. Sure that a fortune could be made by reviving the Antarctic whaling trade, but unable to convince any Australians to join him. Bull returned to Norway in 1893 There he persuaded Svend Foyn, wealthy inventor of the exploding harpoon gun, to back an expedition to assess the Ross Sea's potential for whaling. whales in the northern hemisphere had been hunted to commercial extinction, and although petroleum products had to some degree replaced whale oil, baleen (whalebone) was still prized for women's fashions.\nSailing from Norway in 1893 in a refitted whaling steamer, An/erotic (later to be used by Nordenskitild), Bull's expedition encountered many misfortunes and saw few whales.

On January 18, 1895, Antarctic landed on the Possession Islands, where Borchgrevink discovered lichens, the first vegetation found south of the Antarctic Circle\nSix days later, a party went ashore at Cape Adare in what was claimed to be the first landing ever made on the continent outside the Peninsula. The landing was only one of several disputed 'first landings' on the continent Penguins, rock specimens, seaweed and more lichens were collected Although Antarctids voyage was commeroally unsuccessful, it helped revive interest in Antarctica. Bull himself continued sealing and whaling, and at the age of 62 was shipwrecked on Iles Crozet for two months.\n\" Back to too\nDe Gerlache\nBelgian Adrien Victor Joseph de Gerlache de Gomery (1866-1934), a lieutenant in the Royal Belgian Navy, persuaded the Brussels Geographical Sodety to finances scientific expedition to Antarctica. Sailing in a refitted three-masted sealing ship (with an auxiliary engine) that he purchased in Norway and rechristened Belgica. de Gerlache left Antwerp in 1897 with a decidedly international crew. The Belgian Antarctic Expedition included a Romanian zoologist, a Russian meteorologist, a Polish geologist and a Norwegian who offered to join the expeditionasfirstmate,withoutpay:RoaldAmundsen Astheship'ssurgeon,deGerlachesignedanAmerican,FrederickACook\nThe expedition got a late start sailing south, leaving Punta Arenas on December 14 Some now speculate that this tardy departure was a deliberate attempt by de Gedache to ensure that Beloica would be beset in pack lee and thus forced to remain in the Antarctic for the winter. Others have correctly pointed out that the Antarctic pack was known to be at its most navigable late in summer. By early February, the expedition had discovered and mapped the strait which now bears de Gerlache's name on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. as well as the islands on the west side of that strait: Brabant aI . Anvers and Wencke. Along the eastem side of the strait, they charted the Peninsula's Dance Coast, named for the ship's magnetidan, who died during the expedition.\nPhotography was first used in Antarctica on this expedition. Cook recorded that 'as the ship steamed rapidly along, spreading out one panorama after another of a new wodd, the noise of the camera was as regular and successive as the tap of a stock ticker.'\nBelgic& crossed the Circle on February 15, 1898 By March 1, already deep into the heavy pack ice, she reached 71°31'S. The next day began a long imprisonment in the ice. The ship would not be freed for 377 days - and then only by enormous effort and a great deal of luck. Dunng this, the first time anyone had wintered south of the Antarctic Circle, the expedition underwent great hardships midwinter darkness toyed with the men's sanity, and the lack of vitamin C made them ripe for scurvy.\nCook, who had been on the North Greenland Expedition with Robert E Peary in 1891 and returned to Greenland twice more in the next three years, is probably responsible for saving the ship. To prevent scurvy, he urged de Gerlache to set an example by eating fresh seal and penguin meat, which the men detested. He organized elaborate betting games to take the crew's minds off their desperate orcumstances and encouraged them to think of things to amuse themselves. One popular event, held on Belgian King Leopold's birthday, was the 'Grand Concourse of Beautiful Women' -464 illustrations of beauties 'representing all kinds of poses and dress and undress' were selected from a Paris journal and judged according to 21 characteristics, including 'rosy complexion. - underclothes. \"most beautiful face' and 'sloping, alabaster shoulders.' The men hoped that once the expedition returned to civilization, the\n\n History of Antarctica - Lonely Planet Travel Information\nMtp://www.lonelyplanet.com/antaretica/history\n5 of 11\n6/13/2016 12:47 PM\nwinners would agree to appear before the committee to receive their pnzes.\nThat they would return to civilization was by no means certain, however By January 1899. Cook suggested that they attempt to liberate themselves by hand-sawing a canal 600m from a stretch of open water back to the ship. They worked like dogs for a month When they were within 30m of the ship, a wind shift tightened the pack ice. Their hard-won canal closed within an hour. Two weeks later, the ice opened and they steamed into the polynya, only to be forced to wait another month until they could gain the open sea. Belgica finally reached Punta Arenas on March 28, 1899\nThe primary achievement of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition —surviving the first Antarctic night —proved that bases could be set up on the continent itself, enabling a full-time program of exploration. That knowledge was crucial for the next phase of Antarctic discovery\nAdrien be Gerlache remained involved in Antarctic affairs In 1903 he joined Cheroot's Francais expedition, but resigned in Pernambuco Brazil because he had recently become engaged and missed his fiancée too much to prolong the separation. He later launched a business venture he called 'polar safaris, ' taking tourists to East Greenland and Spitsbergen, but the enterprise collapsed in its initial phase. De Gedache sold his ship, Polans, a 270-tonne barguentine, to Shackleton, who renamed it Endurance. De Gerlache's son, Gaston de Gerlache, joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1957-59.\nBack to ton\nBorchgrevink\nCarsten Egeberg Borchgrevink (1864-1934), son of a Norwegian father and an English mother, sailed with Bull in Antarctic in 1894. Landing at Cape Adare convinced Borchgrevink it was possible to survive an Antarctic winter ashore, so he decided to organize his own expedition to be first to accomplish it.\nFailing to raise any money in Australia Borchgrevink visited Britain, where he met with rejection after rejection —until 1897, when he convinced publisher Sir George Newnes to give £40. 000 Borchgrevink's stunning fundraising success infuriated the British exploration establishment, headed by the Royal Geographical Society, which was preparing its own Antarctic expedition. Even more galling, Borchgrevink's British Antarctic Expedition of 1898-90 was British in name only Just three (two Englishmen and one Australian) of the 31 men were not Norwegian The expedition's Southern Gross, a converted Norwegian sealer, sailed under the Union Jack only at the insistence of its magnanimous sponsor\nDeparting London on August 22, 1898, Southern Cross arrived at Cape Adare on February 17. 1899 Two weeks later, after a pair of simple wooden huts were erected on Ridley Beach, which Borchgrevink named after his mother Southern Cross departed to winter in New Zealand The 10 men left behind were some of the most solitary in history, having the entire Antarctic continent to themselves.\nThey had, however plenty of canine companionship. Borchgrevink brought 90 sledge dogs, the first ever Used in Antarctica. The expedition also pioneered the use of kayaks for sea travel, and was the first to bring to Antarctica the Pnmus stove, a lightweight, portable pressure stove invented in Sweden six years before. Although the kayak never became an important mode of Antarctic transportation, the Primus was carried by nearly every expedition that followed Borchgrevink's. It is still in use today\nUnfortunately, the expedition marked another first —the first human death on the continent —when Norwegian zoologist Nicolai Hansen died on October 14, 1899. He was buried on the ridge above Cape Adare. Aside from Hansen's death, there were other accidents —including a nearly disastrous fire and a narrow escape from coal-fume asphyxiation —but the expedition escaped the dietary and psychological dangers expenenced by Beigica's crew. When Southern Cross returned on January 28, 1900, to pick up the expedition, it had proven a critical fact: humans could survive Antarctica's winter ashore, using a wooden hut as a base for exploration\nBorchgrevink's expedition produced many positive results, including excellent maps of the Ross Sea area drawn by the expedition's English surveyor and magnetician, Wiliam Colbeck of the Royal Navy, which would prove invaluable to later explorers. Nevertheless, Borchgrevink's return to gnoland was all but unheralded. The establishment was still embittered by his fundraising success —and absorbed by Scott's impending expedition Not until 1930 did the Royal Geographical Society award Borchgrevink its Patron's Medal. He died in Norway four years later\n• Back\nDrygalski\nEnch Dagobert von Drygalski (1865-1949), a geography professor at the University of Berlin and leader of a four-year expedition to Greenland was given command of the German South Polar Expedition in 1898 Drygalski and 31 other men sailed from Kiel on August 11,1901, in Gauss, a three-masted schooner with auxiliary engines. Drygalski named the ship after German mathematician Johann Karl Friedrich Gauss, who had calculated the position of the South Magnetic Pole, the accuracy of which Ross had set out to test.\nStopping at Cape Town and iles Kerguelen (where it met an advance party that had been landed previously and picked up coal, provisions and 40 dogs). the expedition sighted land on February21,1902,intheregionofrE DrygalskinamedtheterritoryKaiserMfilhelmIILand.Onthesameday,theshipwasbeset.soonbecoming,inDrygalskiswords,'atoyofthe elements.'\nWith Gauss trapped in the west-drifting pack, the men settled into a routine of scientific work by day, and card games, lectures, beer and music by night.

Das antarktische Intelligenzblatt (the Antarctic Intelligencer)\nA sledging party journeyed 80km to the Antarctic coast, discovenng along the way a low volcano they named Gaussberg after their ship On March 29. 1902, Drygalski ascended 480m in a large, tethered hydrogen balloon and used a telephone to report his observations to the ship. The men recorded penguin sounds with an early phonograph, and undertook two more sledgingtnpstoGaussberg Onthelastofthese,Drygalskiandhiscompanionsnearlywerelostinthetracklesswhitewastelandofsnow-coveredseaice.\nBeing beset during winter was one thing, but when spring and then summer arrived, the men began to feel desperate, especially after sawing, drilling and even dynamiting the 5m- to 5m-thick ice did nothing to free the ship. Gauss' captain suggested they toss message-filled bottles into the sea —and launch others by balloon —so a rescue party might find them.\nA basic pnnciple of physics, luckily observed by Drygalski himself dunng a walk on the roe, liberated them in the end Drygalski remarked that cinders from the ship's smokestack caused the ice on which they landed to melt, since the dark ashes absorbed the sun's heat. He ordered his men to lay a trail of coal ash, supplemented by rotting food and other garbage, across the 600m of ice separating Gauss from open water\nAs hoped. the ingenious trick worked.

But the Kaiser, apparently disappointed that more new territory was not discovered and claimed for the Fathedand. refused the request Despite his disappointment. Drygalski spent the next three decades wnting up the expedition's reports, which occupy 20 volumes.\nBack to too\nNordenSkjOld\nSwedish geologist Nils Otto Gustav Nordenskjold (1869-1928) had previously led expeditions to the Yukon and Tierra del Fuego, and his uncle, the North Polar explorer Nils AE Nordenskiold, made the first transit of the Northeast Passage around Siberia. So he was well suited for the task assigned to him in 1900: leadership of the Swedish South Polar Expedition, the first to winter in the Antarctic Peninsula region.\nSailing in Antarctic, the stout former sealer used by Bull in 1893-95, the expedition left Gothenburg on October 16. 1901. At Antarctic's helm was Larsen. the Norwegian who had already discovered Oscar II Land during a previous expedition in 1892-94 By late January 1902 Antarctic was exploring the western sde of the Peninsula, making several important geographical discovenes (among them, the fact that the Orleans Strait connected with the Gerlache Strait, and not with the Weddell Sea, as had been believed) before sailing back to the tip of the Peninsula. There, they crossed between the Peninsula and off-lying Joinville Island, naming the strait for their ship. Antarctic\nNext the expedition attempted to penetrate south into the Weddell Sea, but its infamous ice stopped them Instead Nordenskjeld and five men set up a winter base on Snow Hill Island in February 1902 Antarctic, meanwhile, sailed for the Falklands to winter there Poor weather confined the Snow Hill party to its small but for most of the winter, but in December NordensigOld was able to sledge to Seymour Island, directly north of Snow Hill, where he found some striking fossils —including the bones of a giant penguin —bolstenng earlier fossil finds made on the island by Larsen in 1893.\nHowever, December is midsummer in Antarctica, and the men were getting distinctly anxious about their ship, which should have arrived by then. Their fears were justified, although they were not to leaM why for many months. After wintering in Patagonia and South Georgia, Antarctic had returned south, again surveying the western side of the Peninsula. Trying unsuccessfully to cross through her namesake strait to reach the Peninsula's east coast —and the men at Snow Hill —Antarctic stopped at AF:igs Bay on the Peninsula's tip to drop off three men, who would try to hike the 320km to Snow Hill\nThe ship then sailed around ,loInville Island and headed south, soon becoming caught in the pack ice, whose relentless grip inexorably crushed it The end, on February 12, 1903, was recorded by one of the men, Carl Skottsberg:\nNow the name disappears from sight.

The Swedish Antarctic Expedition was now split into three groups, two living in very rough conditions, with no group aware of the others fates.

They built a stone but and killed 1100 Adalies for food before the birds left for the winter On June?, Just before midwinter, Ole Wennersgaard, who had been sick for weeks, died. On October 31, Larsen led a group of five others in an open boat to search for the tno at Hope Bay. Finding a note the three had left at their hut. Larsen decided he would have to follow by sea the route that the Hope Bay men were taking to Snow Hill Island.\nEven as Larsen's group rowed their boat south, Outside help was on its way to Snow Hill Island. Since nothing had been heard of the Swedish expedition, three search parties had been dispatched. Argentina sent a naval snip, Uniausv, to search for it in 1903. On November 8 UnrauaVs crew found two of the men from Snow Hill Island camped at Seymour Island, and after waking them, Joined them in the short trek to Snow Hill —arnving, by incredible coincidence, only a few hours ahead of Larsen and his group After a joyful reunion, all that was left to do (on November 11) was pick up the remaining Antarctic crew members back on Paulet Island. They, ironically, had just finished collecting 6000 penguin eggs, their first surplus food supply.\nAlthough Nordenskfifild's expedition is remembered primarily for its survival against nearly overwhelming odds, it also performed the most important research in Antarctica (including studies in botany, geology, glaciology and hydrography) undertaken up to its time.\nBack\nScott's discovery expedition\nEven as Nordenskjold's men were struggling for survival. British explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott (1868-1912) was working from a base on Ross Island The son of an upper- middle-dass brewer, Scott joined the Royal Navy's training ship Britannia as a cadet at age 13. He advanced through the ranks, and was promoted to commander in June 1900. A month later he was named leader of the British National Antarctic Expedition, which the county's exploration establishment had been planning since the mid-1880s\nVVnen Scott's well-financed expedition sailed from Enoland on August 6, 1901 in Discovery, a specially built wooden steam barque, it was the best-equipped scientific expedition to Antarctica to date. After stopping in New Zealand for refitting and reprovisioning, the expedition got off to an inauspicious start when a seaman fell to his death from the top of the mainmast. On January 3. 1902, Discovery crossed the Antarctic Circle, and six days later stopped briefly at Cape Adare\nPenetrating the Ross Sea, Scott cruised along the Ross Ice Shelf, discovering King Edward VII Land on its eastern margin He also made the first flight in Antarctica, on February 4, 1902, in a tethered balloon called Eva. From a height of 240m. Scott saw the Ross Ice Shelf's undulating surface rising toward the polar plateau Camera-toting expedition member Emest Shackleton went up next, becoming Antarctica's first aenal photographer\nBy mid-February 1902, Scott's men had established winter quarters at Hut Point on Ross Island. Although a hut was built ashore, Discovery, frozen into the sea ice, served as the expedition's accommodations. Officers and men were separated into wardroom and mess deck, befitting the quasi-naval expedition that it was. The hut was reserved for scientific work and recreation, induding theatrical performances by the 'Royal Terror Theatre company:\nLife in McMurdo Sound was not all research and games, however) In a violent snowstorm during a sledge tnp, a young sailor named George Vince slipped over a precipice to his death.

To the cheers of Discoverys men, Scott set out for the South Pole on November 2. 1902, with Shackleton, scientific officer Dr Edward A Wlson, 19 dogs and five supply sledges hitched in train formation, Despite initial optimism and a large food depot laid by an &Want.° party, the trio soon struck harsh reality, Antarctica' style. The men had never tried skiing or sled-dog dnving, their inexperience produced predictably poor results\nThrough sheer willpower, they reached 82°17'S on December 30 before turning back Actually, Scott and Vtfilson reached that point, Shackleton having been ordered to remain at camp that morning to look after the dogs. This may not have been an intentional slight on Scott's part (although certainly it was petty), but Shackleton smarted at the gesture.\nFor all three, the trip home was miserable. The remaining dogs by now were nearly worthless, and soon were hitched behind the sledge, which the men pulled themselves. On at least one occasion, a dog was earned on the sledge. As dogs weakened, they were shot and fed to the others. The men were also breaking down Shackleton especially was suffering badly from scurvy —but accounts of the trip that say he had to be carried on the sledge are incorrect.\nTwo weeks before the southern party's return home on February 3, the relief ship Morning arrived in McMurdo Sound Morning's captain, Wiliam Colbeck, had been the surveyor on Borchgrevink's Southern Cross. Corheck and Scott, upon his return, decided that with Discovery still frozen into the ice, Morning should not wait to depart. Seeing that he would probably have to remain another winter, Scott sent home eight men, including Shackleton, who went only upon being ordered. The following summer, after Scott led a sledging party in southern Victoria Land, Morning returned, in company with Terra Nova, sent by the British government. The two vessels bore distressing news if Discovery could not be freed within six weeks, it was to be abandoned. After weeks of cutting and blasting. Scott was nearly ready to give up, but nature relented, and the ice gave way. One final charge, on February 16, 1904, released Discovery for the long tourney home.\nSack to too\nBruce\nScotsman Wiliam Spiers Bruce (1867-1921), the physician son of a surgeon, pined an Antarctic whaling voyage from Dundee as Balaena's surgeon-naturalist in 1892. He would have joined Bull's Antarctic expedition in 1894-95, but was unable to reach Melbourne in time to meet the ship. In 1901 he declined the offer of a position on Scott's expedition because he was in the midst of planning his own Scottish National Antarctic Expedition\nSailing from Troon on November 2, 1902 in Scotia, a renamed Norwegian steam sealer with extremely elegant lines, the expedition pushed south into the Weddell Sea. By 70°S, Scotia was beset, and after freeing herself, headed north to winter at Laurie Island in the South Orkneys. There the expedition set up a meteorological station, hand-built of stone and called Omond House, on April 1, 1903 Midwinter's Day (June 22) 1903 was celebrated with a barrel of Guinness porter, a brew made more potent by the freezing of its water, unintentionally yielding concentrated alcohol.\nAt the end of the first season, Scotia sailed to Port Stanley and Buenos Aires Bruce asked the British government to continue staffing Omond House, but his request was refused. Instead, at the invitation of the British Ambassador, the Oficina Meteorologica An:tontine agreed to assume responsibility for the station This duty, which the Argentine government maintains to the present day, makes the station (now called Orcadas) the oldest continuously operated base in the Antarctic\nPushing south again in January 1904, Bruce was able to penetrate the Weddell Sea to 74°S. There he discovered Coats Land, which he named for the expedition's patrons, Andrew and James Coats of Paisley, Scotland. Scotia followed the coast for 240km, but the fast ice continually kept the ship two or three frustrating kilometers offshore. No landing could be made\nA remarkable series of photographs, documenting the first known use of bagpipes in the Far South, shows an emperor penguin, head thrown back and beak agape, being serenaded by a kilted piper.

Temporary repairs at Port Lockroy enabled the expedition to continue to Tierra del Fuego and Buenos Aires, where Cheroot sold Francais to the Argentine government Then he headed home to a hero's welcome from all of France - except his wife Jeanne (a granddaughter of Victor Hugo) who divorced him for desertion\nFour years later, Cheroot returned to Antarctica, this time leading an expedition sponsored by the French government, which granted him 600, 000 francs. On August 15, 1908, he again sailed from Is Havre this time in the newly built and amusingly named Pourquor Pas? (Why Not?), which he had once christened his toy boats as a child Among those aboard was his second wife, Meg, who sailed as far as Punta Arenas.

The ship also boasted electric lighting and a 1500-volume library.\nThose amenities proved valuable during the winter of 1909, when the expedition wintered at Petermann Island, with Pourquot Pas? frozen into the ice at a bay they called Port Circumcision. The group set up a shore station, with huts for meteorological, seismic, magnetic and tidal research, and passed the winter Kith reading, lectures, meetings of the 'Antarctic Sporting Club' and recitations from a novel being written by one of the officers.\nAt winter's end, they headed north tore-coal the ship at Deception - where a whaling-company diver inspected the ship's damaged hull and warned against further exploratron. Charcot ignored the advice, turning south once more. On January 11, 1910, he made his most personally treasured discovery, sighting an uncharted headland at 70°S, 761W. This he called Cheroot Land (since proven to be an island) - not after himself, but after his esteemed father. Twenty-six years later, Cheroot and POLIMUOi Pas? were again sailing in treacherous waters, this time off Iceland, when a gale arose and claimed captain, ship and all but one of the 43-man crew\nBack to too\nShackleton's Nimrod expedition\nAnglo-Irishman Ernest Henry Shackleton (1874-1922), second of 10 children born to a doctor and his Quaker wife, was badly stung by his breakdown on the retum from Scott's furthest south in 1902. Shackleton lived by his family motto: Fortitudrne vincimus (By fortitude we conquer). Even as he was being invalided home by Scott, Shackleton resolved to return to Antarctica one day - which he did in 1908. An indefatigable worker with a charming, forceful personality, Shackleton inspired fierce loyalty and admiration. His men called him 'The Boss:\nFollowing his return from the Discovery expedition. Shackleton married and fathered the first of his three children, at the same time holding a succession of jobs: magazine journalist, secretary of the Scottish Royal Geographical Society, (unsuccessful) candidate for Parliament and, finally. PR man for a big Glasnow steelworks. The works' owner, William Beardmore, took a liking to Shackleton and agreed to sponsor an Antarctic expedfion\nPtAlp) \"SVCtSVW1eV\\\nThe British Antarctic Expedition sailed from Lvttelton, New Zealand on New Year's Day 1905, in Nimrod, a three-masted sealing ship with 40 years' Arctic experience. To conserve coal, the ship was towed part of the 2700km to the ice edge by the steel-hulled Koonya. Although Shackleton had onginally intended to use Discoverys old base at Ross Island, Scott wrote to him describing his own plans for another Antarctic expedition and asked him to establish his shore base elsewhere Shackleton agreed to seek his own headquarters, but when he arnved at the Ross Ice Shelf in January 1908, he was dismayed to find that the Bay of Whales, the inlet where Discovery had launched its balloon just six years before, had disappeared. Evidently the great ice shelf had calved, in which case it would be nsky to establish a base atop it But Nimrod was unable to push further east, due to pack ice, so Shackleton reluctantly decided louse Ross Island as his base - breaking his promise to Scott\nUnforgivingiceblockedhispathtoHutPoint,however,compellingShackletontobuildhishutatCapeRoydsonRossIsland,30kmfurtherfromhisgoal.Wylehedidn'tbringsledgedogs, neither did Shackleton agree with Scott's romantic notion that manhauling was 'more noble and splendid' than dog-driving. Instead, Shackleton brought Siberian ponies, unfortunately unsuited to the task. Although they managed to pull loads a considerable distance across the Ross Ice Shelf, they did not have dogs' stamina or versatility.\nWith three companions - Jameson Adams, Eric Marshall and Frank Wild - Shackleton pioneered the route up to the polar plateau (which he claimed, and named, for King Edward VII) via the Beardmore Glader, named for the expedition's patron. By January 9, 1909, the foursome had trudged to within 180km of the Pole before being forced by dangerously dwindling supplies offoodtoturnandrunforhome.ItwasthehardestdedsionofShackleton'slifeF2!2j.g.bis.wife-E-Fffilylater.'Ithoughtyou'dratherhavealivedonkeythanadeadlion.'\nStill, they had achieved a remarkable run, beating Scott's furthest south by 589km. discovenng almost 800km of new mountain range, and showing the way to anyone who would attempt the Pole after them. They also found coal and fossils at Mt Buckley at the top of the Beardmore Glader\nThe expedition achieved other firsts. Six men led by Professor TW Edgeworth David ascended Mt Erebus for the first time, reaching the rim of the volcano's crater on March 10, 1908 after a five-day climb. while the polar party was out, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay, with Professor David again leading, hiked neady 1600km to the South Magnetic Pole, reaching lion January 16, 1909, the first time it had been visited. (Today the Pole is offshore in the Dumont d'Urville Sea, and Antarctic tour ships routinely sail over it.) The expedition tested Antarctica's first motorcar, an Anrol-Johnston, at Cape Royds. It was no good in snow, but proved useful for transporting loads across the sea ice. The expeditton also produced about 80 copies of Aurora Austrahs, the first - and only - book published in Antarctica.\nASea totop\nAmundsen\nNorwegian !Enid Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen (1872-1928) was already a veteran explorer by the time he sailed in 1910 from Christiana (modern-day Oslo) on his way to what only he and a few others knew was Antarctica Amundsen had been with the first group to winter south of the Antarctic Circle, the Belgica expedition. From 1903 to 1906 he accomplished the first navigation of the Northwest Passage, a goal sought by mariners for centuries. He spent three winters in the Arctic, learning from the native Inuit much about polar clothing, travel and dog-handling that would later prove invaluable.\nThe Arctic was Amundsen's first interest He had long dreamed of reaching the North Pole. He was well into planning an expedition where he would freeze his ship into the Arctic ice and drift with the current across the Pole when news reached him that American Robert E Peary claimed to have reached 9CFN on Apnl 6, 1909. Amundsen quickly - secretly - turned his ambitions 180°.\nAmundsen's Pram (FOrWard). used by Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen on his unsuccessful attempt to reach the North Pole, sailed from Norway on August 9, 1910 Pram had a diesel engine, allowing quick start-up (as opposed to a coal-fired steam engine), as well as a rounded hull so it would rise out of pressing ice floes rather than being nipped like a standard hull. To prevent Scott from learning his plans, Amundsen kept quiet about his intentions - revealing them to just three members of the expedition - until he reached Madeira, where he told his stunned men Soon after, sent his infamous telegram to Scott in Melbourne: 'Beg leave to inform you Ram proceeding Antarctic Amundsen.'\nAmundsen did not share Shackleton's fear of a dangerously calving Ross Ice Sheff. He established his base, Framheim (home of Fram), on the shelf at the Bay of Whales, Whertel Scott had made Antarctica's first balloon flight In a small prefab wooden hut, nine men spent the winter. Outside, some of the 15 identical tents served as store sheds - and some as doghouses for the expedition's 97 North Greenland dogs. From Frernheim. Amundsen had the advantage of starting 100km closer to the Pole, but he also had to pioneer a route up to the polar plateau from the Ross Ice Shelf. Scott, following Shackleton's lead. could take the charted course up the Beardmore Glaaer.\nLeaving Framheim on October 19, 1911, after making one false start too early in the season, Amundsen and his four companions had four sledges, each pulled by 13 Greenland dogs. Dogs and skis made the difference As Norwegians, they were well trained in the use of skis. During his Arctic years, Amundsen developed excellent dog-dnving skills. He also planned meticulously, took three or four backups of every critical item, and the previous summer had laid 10 extremely well-marked depots as far as 82°S, which together contained 3400kg of stores and food.\nThe five men - Amundsen, Olav Bjaaland, Helmer Hanssen, Sverre Hassel and Oscar Wisting - reached the South Poison December 14, 1911, camping for three days at what they called Polheirn. Amundsen claimed the polar plateau for Norway, calling it King Haakon VII Land, and wrote a note to Scott in the dark green tent he left behind Then, they turned for home.\n'On January 25. at 4am, ' Amundsen laconically recorded in his diary, 'we reached our good little house again, with two Sledges and 11 dogs; men and animals all hale and hearty.' Despite his near-flawless success. there were those who felt Amundsen's achievement was tainted by several factors In some ways, he had made the polar journey look too easy. There was also the view taken by some that Amundsen's surprise assault on the Pole had forestalled Scott, as though the British explorer had the 'nght' to reach the Pole first (although Amundsen preceded him to the Antarctic) Finally, the tragic drama of Scott's expedition was much more the stuff of legend than was Amundsen's cool triumph of technical skill.\n_jBcaScti22\nScott's Terra Nova expedition\n\n http://www.lonelyplanet.com/antarctica/history\nQ?spa-9-c oi-\\\nWien Scott received Amundsen's startling cable on Oct 13, 1910— the day after TerraNova arrived in port —Scott became deeply distressed, but worked hard not to show it. He had first\nwatched Shackleton come close to snatching what he regarded as his prize. Now a dangerous new threat had arisen.\nSalop from New ZeaJang on November 29. 1910, in TerraNova, the old Scottish whaler that had been one of the two relief ships sent at the end of the Discovery expedition, Scotts British Antarctic Expedition got off to a rough start. Three days out of port. Term Nova was hit by a screaming 35-hour gale that nearly sank her Arriving at Ross Island in January 1911, Scott found ice blocking the way to his old Discovery hut on Hut Point. so he established winter quarters at Cape Evans, named after his second-in-command, ERGR 'Teddy' Evans. As soon as the hut was built, Scott commenced an ambitious program of depot-laying. He also introduced a useful Antarctic innovation: a telephone line was established between Cape Evans and Hut Point Ponies, motor-sledges and dogs (and, later, mules) were employed to set up supply caches, but once again, when these methods failed, the expedition resorted to the old British standby of manhauling.\nThe next spring, on October 24, Scott dispatched a party with two motor-sledges, and eight days later followed with a larger group of men and 10 ponies Venous teams relayed supplies and laid depots. On January 4, 1912, the last support party turned back. For the final push to the Pole, Scott had chosen his companion on his previous journey furthest south, Edward Wlson, along with Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans. Henry Bowers was added only the night before, a tactical error, since the food, tent and skis had been planned for a four-man team\nWhat happened next is the most famous Antarctic story of all The five arnved at the Pole on January 17, 1912, to find that Amundsen had beaten them by 35 days. Nothing tells the fate better than Scott's diary itself, unless it is one of the many biographies that deconstruct what has grown to be a hoary legend. Their return home was a haunting, desperate run of barely Sighted depots, slow starvation and incredible cold. A delinous Evans died on February 17. A Month later, Oates was in such bad shape that he prayed not to wake upon retiring. The next morning, deeply disappointed to find himself among the living. Oates walked out of the tent in a raging blizzard, telling his companions, 'I am just going outside and may be some time ' Another blizzard kept the three remaining men in their tent from March 21 onwards. Scott's last entry was dated march 29. A search party sent out the following spring found them on November 12, 1912.\nAmong the effects the searchers found in the tent with the men's bodies was Amundsen's letter to the King of Notwat Scott had brought it with him as requested. Thus, one slightly ironic outcome of this tragic 'race' is that Scott ended up confirming Amundsen's attainment of the Pole.\nDespite being beaten to 90° South, Scott's last expedition accomplished a great deal of important science. The push for research had itself contnbuted to the polar party's destruction, since the men dragged a sledge that carried, among other items, 16kg of geological samples The infamous three-man midwinter trek to Cape Crozier, which Apsley Cherry-Garrard chronicled so eloquentlyinTheWorstJourneyintheWorld,braved24-hourdarknessandtemperaturesaslowas-WC—socoldthatthemen'steethcrackedintheirmouthsandtheywere'beginning to think of death as a friend, ' as Cheny-Garrard wrote —all so that they could be the first to collect emperor penguin embryos A separate Northern Party, led by Victor Campbell, discovered Oates Land (memonalizng Lawrence Oates) and spent a winter of ternble pnvation in a snow cave at Terra Nova Bay on the Ross Sea's western shore. A six-man group led by geologist Griffith Taylor explored the mysterious, otherworldly Dry Valleys, which Scott found on the Discovery expedition.\nBack\nShirase\nComing from a country with no tradition of exploration, Nobu Shirase (1861-1946), a lieutenant in the Japanese Army and eldest son of a Buddhist pnest was a surpnse visitor to Antarctica Despite the Japanese public's outright scorn of his fundraising efforts, Shirase organized an Antarctic expedition in 1910 Sailing from Tokyo on December 1 in Kainan Maw (Southern Pioneer), the expedition reached Victona Land in March 1911 Unable to land, it returned to winter in Sydney, where Shirase and his countrymen set up camp in the garden of a well-to-do resident of suburban Vaucluse\nBy mid-January 1912, Kainan Mara was back in the Ross Sea, this time with 29 Sakhalin sledge dogs. It met Amundsen's expedition at the Bay of Whales on the Ross Ice Shelf. Amundsen —and Scott, too —had by this time already reached the Pole, although Shirase, of course, could not know it. Despite being far behind, Shirase and six of his men formed a 'dash patrol' and in a symbolic gesture, headed south with dogs and sledges. First, however, they had to claw their way atop the Ross Ice Shelf, which towered nearly 90m over the sea where Kainan Maw stood offshore. The patrol dashed 260km to a furthest south of 80°5'S, reached on January 28, 1912, There, Shirase claimed all the area of the Ross Ice Shelf within sight as the 'Yamato Yulahara. ' or 'Yamato Snow Plain' CYamato' being a poetical name for Japan) This claim has never been taken senously (even by ;apart) since Amundsen had already crossed the area on his way south to the Pole. The expedition had to abandon a score of dogs, eenly prefiguring the dogs marooned at Syowa station 46 years later Nevertheless, Shirase's team was welcomed as heroes when they returned to Voloahaina on June 20, 1912.\nBack to top\nMawson\nAustralian geologist Douglas Mawson (1882-1958) had been asked by Robert Scott to accompany Terra Nova, but he declined the invitation in favor of leading his own expedition.

Its master was Captain John King Davis. Aboard was the first airplane taken to the Antarctic. a Vickers REP monoplane that had crashed dunng a test flight before the expedition left Australia Mawson brought the wingless aircraft anyway, hoping to use it as an 'air tractor, ' but its engine seized while towing a heaw load\nAurora arrived at the ice edge in January 1912, then headed west and followed the coast to new territories, which Mawson called King George V Land and claimed for the British crown. At Cape Denison on Commonwealth Bay, he set up his base, unaware that the roaring katabatics make the spot one of the windiest places on earth. He later gave it the memorable name 'the Home of the Blizzard.' Eight men led by Frank Wild, another veteran of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, were landed at the Shackleton Ice Shelf, 2400km west of Cape Denison.\nBattling wind speeds that occasionally reached more than 320km/h at Commonwealth Bay, the expedition systematically explored King George V Land, as well as neighboring Terre Adelie, during summer 1912-13 On one sledging trip, the first Antarctic meteorite was found. The expedition also made the first radio contact between Antarctica and another continent, on September 25, 1912, using a wireless relay at a five-man station the expedition established on Macquarie Island.\nDespite those accomplishments and the comprehensive research done by the expedition, it is remembered pnmarily for the ordeal its leader endured on a deadly dog-sledging journey. With British soldier Belgrave Ninnis and Swiss mountaineer and ski champion Xavier Mertz, Mawson left Cape Denison on November 10, 1912, to explore eastward. By December 14, after crossing two heavily crevassed glaciers (later named for Mertz and blinnis), they had traveled 500km from their base That afternoon. Ninnis disappeared down an apparently bottomless crevasse with his team of dogs —and most of the party's food, all of its dog food and its tent. 'It seemed so incredible, ' Mawson wrote later, 'that we half expected, on turning round, to find him standing there '\nThey immediately began a harrowing trek home. Battling hunger, cold, fatigue and, possibly, vitamin A poisoning from the dog livers they were forced to eat, Mawson and Mertz struggled on Mertz died on January 7, when they were still more than 160km out. Mawson sawed the remaining sledge in half with a pocketknife to lighten his load By now his body was literally coming apart: hair falling out, toenails loosened, even the thick soles of his feet sloughing off. Somehow he reached Cape Denison —5 few hours after Aurora had sailed.\nSix men had remained behind at the hut, hoping against hope that the missing party might return. Although they radioed the ship, heavy seas prevented Aurora from reaching Cape Denison They were forced to spend another winter, arriving home in Australia in late February, 1914\nIn 1929-31 Mawson returned to Antarctica, leading the two summer voyages of the British, Australian 8 New zaaiano Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) to the west of Commonwealth Bay, where they discovered Mac.

He died in August 1912 during the dnft and was, as Rohner later wrote, 'committed to the sea in a sack, along with a heavy weight.'\nFilchner led a three-Man party on a dangerous midwinter dog-sledging trip over 65km of sea ice to the charted location of 'New South Greenland, 'which American sealer Benjamin Morrell claimed to have sighted in 1823. Finding nothing but frozen ocean, Filchner proved the nonexistence of Morrell's 'discovery.'

Ernest Shackleton had also set his sights on crossing Antarctica. The threat of a German expedition attempting the same journey helped Shackleton raise funds; nationalistic Britons sent in contributions to the 'first crossing of the last continent ' Shackleton's plan was simple but ambitious he would sail in Endurance to the Weddell Sea coast, establish a base, then trek across the continent via the Pole At the top of the Beardmore Glacier, the crossing party would be met by another group, which would have been landed at Ross Island by Aurora, sailing from Hobart.\nEven as Endurance prepared to sail, the firestorm ignited by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife on June 28, 1914 began engulfing Europe. Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, and Shaddeton immediately offered Endurance and her crew for war service.

The events that followed have grown to legend, becoming nearly as famous as the story of Scott's last expedition The ship, inexorably crushed by the grinding ice floes, finally Sank on November 21. Shackleton and his men lived on the pack ice for five months before they sailed three small boats to Elephant Island. Since it was uninhabited.

He and two of the six men who had sailed James Ca/rd with him, Tom Crean and Frank Worsley, hiked for 36 straight hours over the 1800m-high mountains and crevassed glaciers to reach Stromness whaling station As they neared the station, impassable ice cliffs forced them to lower themselves down an icy, 9rn waterfall Arriving at the station on May 20, 1916, their long beards, matted hair, ragged clothes - and farce body odor, no doubt - caused the first three people they met to flee in disgust.\nAt the home of the station manager, where they bathed and were fed and clothed, Shackleton asked, 'When was the war over?' 'The war is not over, ' the manager answered. 'Millions are being killed. Europe is mad. The world is mad ' That night a whaler was dispatched to pick up the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. After three failed rescue attempts over the next four months, Shackleton enlisted the help of Yelcho, a steamer lent by the Chilean government, and was finally able to pick up all 22 men stranded at Elephant Island on August 30.\nStill, Shackleton's troubles were not over - the Ross Sea party had encountered its own difficulties Aurora had intended to winter at Ross Island, but a blizzard blew the ship from its moorings, stranding at Cape Evans 10 men who spent a miserable winter with minimal supplies. Aurora, meanwhile, was beset for 10 months, finally getting free on March 14, 1916. Shackleton met the ship in New Zealand and after an extensive refitting Aurora was able to relieve the marooned Cape Evans party on January 10, 1917. The war, meanwhile, raged for another 22 bloody months, long enough for two of Shackleton's men to die in the fighting\nShackletontime livedtomountafinalassaultontheAntarctic,theill-definedQuestexpedition,UponreachingSouthGeorgia,hesufferedamassiveheartattackanddiedonJanuary5, 1922 aboard his ship, moored alongside at Grytviken\n\" Back to too\nWilkins\nAustralian George Hubert Wilkins (1888-1958), a Balkan War combat photographer and veteran of two Antarctic expeditions including the one in Shackleton's Quest, decided in 1928 that the time was right to attempt a flight in Antarctica Wilkins had already flown 4000km across the Arctic Ocean earlier in the year. becoming the first to cross the region by air, and now he took the same pilot (Carl Ben Belson) and the same plane (now called Los Angeles) south to tackle The Ice\nWith his Arctic success guaranteeing him a well-funded expedition - including a lucrative US$25, 000 news-nghts contract with American press lord Wiliam Randolph Hearst - Wilkins was transported one whaling ship, Hektona, which called at Deception Island He also brought with him a backup pilot, Joe Crosson. and a second wood-framed Lockheed Vega monoplane, chnstened San Francisco. These planes were considered revolutionary for their time, having no wires or exposed controls that offered extra wind resistance\nWilkins had equipped the Vegas with pontoons to enable it to take off from the protected waters of Deception's Port Foster But on test runs he encountered a uniquely Antarctic hazard. hundreds of albatrosses, attracted to the open water created when the ship broke the harbor ice. So Wikins and his men - aided by crews from the nearby whaling station - cleared a runway on shore It was rough, running 800m up shill, down across ditches, up another hill and down to the harbor If a plane hadn't enough speed to take off by then, it would plunge into the water On November 16. 1928, Wilkins and Eielson took off in Los Angeles. flying for just 20 minutes before the weather dosed in.

All told, he mapped 200, 000 sq km of new territory. proving beyond doubt the airplane's efficacy in Antarctic work He later supported Lincoln Ellsworth with his fights over Antarctica\n'Back to too\nByrd AmencanflierRichardEvelynByrd(1888-1957)wasscaredofWilkins.AgraduateoftheUSNavalAcademy,Byrdhadclaimedin1926lobefirsttoflyovertheNorthPole(theclaimhas been questioned). In 1927 he was narrowly beaten by Charles Lindbergh in the era's greatest race. solo across the Atlantic Soon after, he made it his goal to become first to fly over the South Pole\nFollowing his Arctic flight, Byrd raised nearly a million dollars from such eminent sponsors as Charles Lindbergh (US$1000). the National Geographic Society and the New York Times, Which paid US$60, 000 for exclusive nghts and the privilege of sending its own reporter Russell Owen, on the expedition. Byrd's United States Antarctic Expedition (USAE) was the best-funded pnvate expedition to Antarctica in history It sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey in August 1928, in the square-ngged City of New York with not one, but three aircraft 'Accompanied by business managers, physioans, cameramen, dog trainers, scientists, aviators, newspapermen, ' Time magazine wrote of the departing expedition, 'the size and diversity of its personnel suggests a circus '\nLittle America, the expedition's base, was established at the Bay of Whales on the Ross Ice Shelf in January 1929. Byrd quickly set up a flying program with his three planes - a big aluminum Ford trimotor Floyd Bennett, named for his North Pole pilot who had died of pneumonia earlier in 1928, a smaller, single-engine Fairchild, Stars and Stripes; and a single-engine Fokker Universal named The Virginian for Byrd's home state.\nIn March the expedition suffered Antarctica's first plane crash, but luckily no one was in The Virginian A five-man party had been flown south to survey the Rockefeller Mountains (named for an expedition sponsor), when a blizzard blasted them for 12 days. Although the Fokker was bed down, so funous was the wind that when the pilot made a radio call back to Little Amer- Lee from inside the plane, he saw that the airspeed indicator read 140km/h. A few mornings later, the men awoke at their nearby camp to find that the plane had flown itself 800m to an inevitable crash, Byrd and the others eventually rescued the stranded party\nWith winter's onset, the two remaining planes were cached in snow shelters. The men settled down to an under-snow routine of research, repair work, radio training, and recreation, which included watching some of the expedition's 75 movies, carefully selected for their unprovocatIve story lines On August 24 the sun rose again, and preparations for the big flight began. By November, a fuel depot was set up at the foot of the Axel Heiberg Glacier (the same Wader Amundsen hadused) leading up to the polar plateau, since FloydBellnen fuel tanks couldn't carry enough to reach 90°S and back.\nOn November 28, a field party working in the Queen Maud Mountains far to the south radioed Little America that the weather was clear Four men - Byrd as navigator: Bemt Balchen, chief pilot Harold June, Second pilot and radio operator; and Ashley McKinley, photo surveyor - climbed into the big Ford trimotor.

But this was his finest hour. \" Back to top\nEllsworth\nAmerican Lincoln Ellsworth (1880-1951), scion of a wealthy Pennsylvania coal-mining family, had whetted his appetite for polar exploration in 1925, when he made the first flight toward the North Pole with Board Amundsen. The flight failed, but he reached the Pole in 1926, three days after Byrd's flight.\nIn 1931 Ellsworth began what would become along and productive association with Hubert Wilkins —with the goal of crossing Antarctica by air For the first of their four expeditions together. Ellsworth bought a Northrop Gamma monoplane, which he named Polar Star, and a stout Norwegian fishing vessel, named VVyatt Earp after his hero, the gun-slinging marshal of the Old West, whose wedding ring Ellsworth wore and whose gun and holster he carried with him everywhere. For his pilot, Ellsworth chose BeMt Balthen, chief pilot on Byrd's expedition.\nThe first Ellsworth Antarctic Expedition in 1933-34 ended after one short flight from skis in the frozen-over Bay of Whales The plane was parked overnight on an ice floe, and a massive breakup early the next morning left the aircraft dangling by its wngtips from two separate pieces of the floe. The expedition was forced to retreat north, where Ellsworth's money soon funded the plane's repair.\nIn late 1934 he was back in the Antarctic, with a new flight plan. the expedition would fly from Whims' old base at Deception Island to the Ross Sea via the Weddell Sea. But the season's first try was another disaster —an engine seized after its heavy preserving lubricant was not drained before starting. The expedition again retreated north, to pick up a spare part that Ellsworth had flown in from the factory to a South American port. The next flight was equally frustrating- Balchen turned the plane around after little more than an hour, dting heavy weather to the south. though Ellsworth saw only a small squall While he retained respect for Balchen, Ellsworth never hired him again.\nThe third try, in 1935, was lucky for Ellsworth, but only on the season's third attempt. Ellswodh's new pilot, Anglo-Canadian Herbed Hollick-Kenyon, made two false starts —the first aborted by a leaky fuel gauge and the second by a threatening storm. Polar Star finally took off from Dundee Island at the tip of the Peninsula on November 22, 1935, headed for the Bay of whales on the Ross Ice Shelf. As the par flew south, sighting and naming the Eternity and Sentinel Ranges, Ellsworth was overcome by the realization that his years of effort were finally paying off. 'Suddenly I felt supremely happy for my share in the opportunity to unveil the last continent in human history.'\nThe 3700km flight was intended to last just 14 hours, even with landings to refuel. Poor weather stretched the trip to two weeks, during which time the pair established four separate camps. Unfortunately, their radio went dead during that penod, prompting fear that they had penshed. Even on the last leg of the flight, problems plagued them: Polar Star ran out of fuel 25km from the Bay of Whales, and they trekked eight days to reach it. Australia meanwhile, urged on by Douglas Mawson and John King Davis dispatched a 'rescue' attempt, although Wilkins and Wyatt Earp had already made detailed plans to pick up Ellsworth and Hollick-Kenyon at the Bay of whales after their flight The Australians met the explorers at Byrd's former base, Little Americas. where the explorers had been living comfortably for nearly a month. Heavy ice, meanwhile, slowed Wyatt Carp, which arrived four days later. After returning to a heroes' welcome in the US, Ellsworth made a final expedition to Antarctica with his faithful fnend Hubert Wilkins in 1938, then retired from exploration for good.\n\" Back to too\nThecontemporaryera\nWilkins' flight was one of the last large private expeditions made to Antarctica WVVII interrupted the plans of many explorers, although a secret Nazi expedition in 1938-39, led by Alfred Ritscher, was dispatched to Antarctica by Field Marshal Hermann Goring. Goring was interested both in claiming territory and in protecting Germanys growing whaling fleet. The expedition used seaplanes to overly vast sketches of the ice sheet, dropping unique 1.5m darts inscribed with swastikas to establish sovereignty —claims that were never recognized\nLater in the war, a German Hillskreuzer (auxiliary raider), an armed merchant ship disguised to look like an innocent vessel from another nation, succeeded in a daring Antarctic raid that capturednearlytheentireNorwegianwhalingfleet—allwithoutbloodshedorasingleshotfired.OnJanuary14,1941,at5r5.3°30'W,(betweentheSouthSandwichIslandsand Bouvetraya), Schiff 33 (also known as Penguin) stealthily approached and then captured one supply vessel, two factory ships and 11 whale-catchers —with a combined cargo of more than 18,000tonnesofvaluablewhaleoil.AllbutoneoftheshipsweresentasprizesbacktoOccupiedFrance Onewhale-catcherwasretainedandconvertedtoanotherauxiliaryraider.\nIn 1943 Britain began the permanent occupation of Antarctica, establishing Base A at Port Lockroy. After the war the cost of mounting a major expedition pushed nearly everyone but national governments out of the game.\n\" Back to too\nOperations Highjump & Windmill\nIn 1946 the US launched Operation Highjump, history's largest Antarctic expedition Officially called the US Navy Antarctic Developments Project, it was pnmanly a training exercise to give US forces experience in polar operations, which would have been valuable for Mein had the Cold War, then developing with the Soviet Union. flared into an all-out Arctic fight. Highjump sent 4700 men, 33 aircraft, 13 ships and 10 Caterpillar tractors to the continent. It used helicopters and icebreakers for the first time in the Antarctic Tens of thousands gf aerial photographs were taken along nearly three-quarters of the continents coast, although their usefulness for mapmaking was limited by a lack of ground surveys A smaller, follow-up expedition the next year (later nicknamed Operation Windmill for its extensive use of helicopters) surveyed major features sighted by Highjump.\n\" Sack to too\nAnare\nIn February 1954, Phillip Garth Law and the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) set up Mawson station in East Antarctica.

Yet even before they laid eyes on it, most early explorers were convinced a large, southern continent existed. They called it Terra Australis Incognita—the Unknown Southern Land.\nThe idea went back to the ancient Greeks, who had a fondness for symmetry and balance. There must be a great continent to the\nsouth, they postulated, to balance the great land masses in the northern hemisphere. Two thousand years later, the great age of exploration brought Europeans far enough south to test the hypothesis.\nIn 1520, after he had sailed through the Strait that now bears his name, Magellan speculated that the land to his south, Tierra del Fuego, might mark the northern edge of a great continent. Fifty-eight years later, in 1578, Sir\nFrancis Drake sailed his Golden Hind through Magellan's Strait. He encountered severe weather on the Pacific side and was blown to the south of Tierra del Fuego, then east around Cape Horn. It became obvious that Magellan's \"continent\" was merely a series of islands at the tip of South America. If there was indeed a southern continent, it had to be further south.\nIt seems ironic that the severe weather that makes the southern ocean so dangerous, particularly in the south Atlantic, was a\nkey factor in the discovery of Antarctica. Time and time again, sailors blown off course by a storm discovered new land. Often, this new land was further south than any previously known. While attempting to navigate around Cape Horn in 1619, the Spaniards Bartoleme and Gonzalo Garcia de Nodal were blown off course, only to discover the tiny islands they named Islas Diego Ramirez. This would be the most southerly recorded land for another 156 years.\nIn 1622, the Dutch pilot Dirck Gerritsz reported being driven south to 64°S, where he supposedly discovered a land with\nsnow-covered mountains, a land similar in appearance to Norway. The accuracy of his latitude calculation is suspect, but it is possible that he sighted the South Shetland Islands. In 1675, the British merchant Anthony de la Roch was blown far to the east and south of the Straits of Magellan, to a latitude of 55°S, where he found shelter in an unnamed bay. During his stay at what was almost certainly South Georgia Island, he also sighted what he thought to be the southern continent to the south and east. In fact, what he saw was most probably the Clerke Rocks, which lie 48 kilometers southeast of South Georgia. Their location corresponds to where the shore of Terra Australis Incognita was placed on the Dutch East India Company map of the time, which de la Roche had studied.\n\n For the first 200 years or so of European exploration, most voyages were concerned either with commerce or with the\ninvestigation of the newly discovered American continents. The first systematic search for a southern continent didn't come until nearly the beginning of the eighteenth century. In September of 1699, the scientist Edmond Halley left England aboard the Pink Paramour to establish the true longitude of ports in South America and Africa, measure magnetic variations, and search for the mysterious Terra Australis Incognita. By January, he had crossed the Antarctic Convergence and on February 1, 1700 at 52°24'S, Halley made the first recorded sighting of tabular icebergs, which he sketched into the ship's logbook. However, the cold, stormy weather, and the danger of collision with an iceberg in the fog drove him north again.\nDuring the 1700's, the French became active in exploring for new land to the south, and a possible southern continent was on their minds. Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier was searching for the fabled \"Gonneville's\nLand\" when he sighted land on January 1, 1739 at about 54°S latitude. He called it \"Cape Circumcision,\" but it was actually an island (now called Bouvetmya, or Bouvet Island). It is the most isolated island on Earth. (Because his estimate of longitude was so far off, the island was not sighted again until 1808, though many explorers looked for it.)\nYves-Joseph de Kergulen-Trmarec set sail with two ships in 1771, with specific instructions to find the southern continent. On\nFebruary 12, 1772, in the south Indian Ocean, he sighted a fog-shrouded land at 49°40'S but could not make a landing because of high seas and foul weather. A boat from his sister ship did manage a brief landfall to claim the island (Kergulen Island) for France. His firm belief in the existence of a fabled, hospitable, southern continent blinded him to the desolate reality of his find, though. He sailed back to France with wild tales of a populated, temperate paradise he called \"New South France.\" His stories convinced the French government to invest in another expensive expedition. In 1773, Kergulen returned to his island with three ships but still did not personally set foot on the island that bears his name. Even worse, he was forced to accept the truth about his find and returned to France in disgrace.\nIn 1767, Alexander Dalrymple published An Account of the Discoveries made in the South Pacific Ocean Previous to 1764. In it, he made a strong case for a giant, unknown southern continent. According to Dalrymple, this\ncontinent's northern shore lay in the Pacific Ocean, somewhere between 28°S and 40°S latitude. The English government listened. In 1768, Captain James Cook was sent to the South Pacific, first to observe the upcoming transit of Venus, and second, to proceed south in a search for this continent. He returned to England three years later with a wealth of new geographical, biological, and anthropological information--but no sign of a southern continent. Again, the shores had been pushed south from their presumed position.\n\n In July, 1772, Cook sailed from England again, and this time, according to both the British Admiralty and his own inclination, the\nsearch for the southern continent was his primary mission. He also intended to confirm the existence of Bouvet's \"Cape Circumcision\" and Kergulen's recently discovered \"New South France.\"\nIn early December, 1772, Cook crossed the convergence and came upon his first iceberg. After searching in vain for Bouvet's cape, Cook bore east and south. On January 17, 1773, at about 40°E longitude, he made the\nfirst crossing of the Antarctic Circle in history. At 67°15'S, the ice pack forced them north again, a mere 80 miles from the Antarctic coastline. In February, the Resolution and Adventure passed south of the position reported by Kergulen, making it clear to Cook that whatever the Frenchman had found was not part of any southern continent.\nAfter spending the austral winter exploring the Pacific's more temperate and tropical latitudes (and further disproving Dalrymple's theory of a southern land between 28°S and 40°S), Cook headed south again in late November\n1773. He crossed the Antarctic Circle for the second time in December, reaching 67°31'S. Once again, however, the pack ice forced him north. On January 26, 1774, Resolution crossed the Antarctic Circle for a third time, reaching 71°10'S at 106°54'W in the Amundsen Sea. This was further south than anyone had ever gone before.\nCook spent a second austral winter in the tropics before continuing his eastward circumnavigation of Antarctica. On January 14,\n1775, after passing through the Straits of Magellan, he sighted new land. By January 16, he had named Willis' and Bird Islands and, 100 years after de la Roche, had re-discovered and named South Georgia Island. After exploring its northern shore for a few days, Cook headed south to investigate the other land that de la Roche had seen (and that Alexander Dalrymple had thought to be part of a continent), the Clerke Rocks. Finally, on January 26, the Resolution came upon the southern end of what are now known as the South Sandwich Islands. At close to 60xS latitude, they were at that time the southernmost land ever sighted.\nNear the end of February, 1775, Cook crossed his track of 1772, completing the first circumnavigation of Antarctica and proving\nonce and for all that the southern continent, if one existed, was neither as large nor as habitable as once thought He did believe there was a southern land mass, but that it was of little use to anyone.\n\n James Cook's Antarctic circumnavigation stands as one of the greatest of all human voyages of exploration. His\nthorough investigation and reasoned dismissal of Antarctica's value was enough to dissuade governments from further expenditures. (In fact, except for one British and one Russian expedition, government funded exploration did enter a sixty year hiatus.) But Cook had not taken human greed into consideration. Ironically, it was Cook's own penchant for thoroughness that fueled the burst of activity that followed his voyage; he had noted in his log the large numbers of seals and whales he observed in the high latitudes. Before long, hunters were headed south.\nBetween 1784 and 1822, millions of seal skins were taken from South Georgia, the Falkland Islands, the Cape Horn region, the\nSouth Sandwich Islands, and the coast of Chile. As many as three million skins were taken from the Juan Fernandez Islands alone, driving the seal population there nearly to extinction. Sub- Antarctic islands, such as Kergulen, Crozet, Marion, Prince Edward, and Macquarie, were denuded as well, leaving the sealers hungry for new hunting grounds.\nWhalers came south, too, to hunt the southern right whale and to take advantage of the abundance of seals and the high profits of\nsealing. While many whalers joined the slaughter of fur seals, others hunted the southern elephant seal. Millions of elephant seals were butchered and rendered into oil as a substitute for whale oil.\nA new phase in Antarctic exploration, and exploitation, began in 1819. A merchant captain named William Smith was sailing around Cape Horn on his way to Valparaiso, Chile when he detoured to the south to\navoid unfavorable winds. On February 19, he sighted previously unknown land and the next day, after the weather had cleared a little, he fixed its position at 62°17'S and 60°12'W, further south even than Cook's South Sandwich Islands. Smith had discovered Livingston Island in the South Shetlands. More importantly, he had discovered more seals.\nSmith returned in October of the same year to take soundings and explore his find. On October 16, he made a landing on\nDesolation Island, planted a flag, and claimed the new land for Britain.\nThe seal hunters didn't waste any time. As soon as word of Smith's discovery got around the ports of Argentina and Chile,\nmerchantmen were scrambling to take advantage of the new hunting grounds. The first ship to arrive in the South Shetlands was an chartered Argentine vessel. The crew took 14,000 skins in five weeks. On December 25, 1819, British sealers landed on Rugged Island, claimed it for\n\n Britain, and set about their business. The American sealer Hersilia (with Nathaniel Palmer as second mate) sighted Smith Island on January 18, 1820 and arrived at Rugged Island to join the British a few days later. The extermination of South Shetland seals had begun.\nMeanwhile, the British Royal Navy had sent Edward Bransfield to determine if the new land was part of a continent or a string of islands. Bransfield was also ordered to chart harbors, collect natural science specimens, and\ntake weather and magnetic readings. On January 16, 1820, he sighted Livingston Island, and on January 22 made a landing on King George Island, claiming the land (yet again) for Britain. Sailing southwest, Bransfield discovered Deception Island, Tower Island, and the Bransfield Strait. On January 30, Bransfield (or a member of his crew) was the first to lay eyes on the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula, a place he called \"Trinity Land.\"\nBransfield continued his explorations until the middle of March, 1820, discovering Gibbs, O'Brien, Elephant, Seal, and Clarence\nIslands, and sailing into the Weddell Sea--the first person in history to do so.\nAt the same time that Bransfield was charting the South Shetlands, Captain Thaddeus von Bellingshausen was commanding\nRussia's first government-sponsored Antarctic expedition (and the last one until those of the International Geophysical Year, 135 years later). On January 15, 1820, Bellingshausen crossed the Antarctic Circle (just west of the Greenwich Meridian). His crew was only the second group of men in history to do so. The next day, Bellingshausen was prevented from going further south by a massive, continental ice shelf. This was the Finibul Ice Shelf, and the occasion marked the first sighting of the continent of Antarctica by human eyes. Bellingshausen had beat Bransfield by two weeks.\nDuring the course of the next three weeks, Bellingshausen crossed the Antarctic Circle twice more, each time sighting a barrier of\ncontinental ice. On January 27 he recorded his position as 69°21'S, 2°14'W and on February 5 as 69°07'S, 15°W. Both times he noted the existence of an enormous ice shelf to the south, stretching away to the east and west. Since he was only a few miles from the coast of Antarctica each time, the ice shelf was undoubtedly the one that rims the Princess Astrid Coast.\nBellingshausen continued his explorations for the next year, becoming the first explorer to circumnavigate Antarctica since\nJames Cook. On January 21, 1821, Bellingshausen reached 69°53'S and discovered the most southerly known land (Peter I Island). He saw the continent again on January 28 at 69°43'S and named it the Alexander Coast (now called Alexander Island). In the South Shetlands he encountered and spoke with Nathaniel Palmer, who by now was master of his own sealing ship, the Hero.\nThe sealers had been busy. During the 1820-21 summer season there were between 55 and 60 sealing vessels working the South\n\n Shetlands (accounts vary), with upwards of 1000 men. New sealing grounds were sought out and the seals dispatched with great alacrity. The slaughter was phenomenal. Perhaps a quarter of a million seals were eliminated in the space of three months. The carnage wasn't entirely one-sided, though; six vessels and an unknown number of men were lost to the hazards of the environment.\nIn his own search for virgin sealing grounds, Palmer explored to the south of the Shetlands, sailing a few miles west of Bransfield's\ntrack. On November 15, 1820 he observed the mountains of \"Trinity Land,\" the second known sighting of the Antarctic Peninsula. He also discovered McFarlane Strait and Yankee Harbor. Although it is possible that other sealers had seen the Peninsula before him, their logs are lost and there is no record other than Palmer's.\nThe first recorded landing on the Antarctic continent took place on February 7, 1821. Men from the American sealer Cecilia,\nunder Captain John Davis, landed at Hughes Bay (64°01'S) looking for seals. Though they were on shore for less than an hour, these men were the first humans to set foot on this new southern land. Davis correctly guessed that the land was a continent.\nAnother significant first took place in 1821. One officer and ten men from the British sealer Lord Melville were forced to spend the\nwinter on King George Island after their ship was driven offshore by a storm and didn't return. This was the first time men had endured the Antarctic winter. They were rescued the following summer.\nNinety-one sealing vessels were operating in the Shetlands during the 1820-21 season, and all remaining fur seals were\nsystematically exterminated. On December 7, 1821 George Powell, a sealer and amateur naturalist, joined with Nathaniel Palmer to search for new sealing grounds to the east of the Shetlands. Soon they had discovered the South Orkney Islands, but since there were no fur seals to be found there, Palmer left it to Powell to make an exploratory landing.\nTo their credit, these two sealers conducted science when time allowed. Powell took readings and samples, and Palmer on his final voyage had with him Dr. James Eights, the first real scientist to visit the Antarctic. During\nthe voyage, Eights discovered pycnogonids and collected the first Antarctic fossils.\nThe next sixteen years saw several attempts by sealers to locate new sealing grounds. Many of these voyages were underwritten\nby the British whaling firm Enderby Brothers (formerly Enderby & Sons), whose owners were as eager to have their captains make new geographical discoveries as they were to have them turn a profit. As a result, new islands were discovered and thousands of miles of new coastline were charted. The outlines of the new continent began to take shape.\n\n One of the first of these \"sealer- scientists,\" however, was not an Enderby man. He was James Weddell, captain of the brig\nJane. Weddell had taken part in the 1820-21 and 1821-22 sealing seasons in the South Shetlands and had made enough money to finance a third expedition. Like the Enderbys, Weddell was as interested in new discoveries as he was in filling his hold with fur seal skins. He was an avid explorer, naturalist, and geographer. He was also the first Antarctic conservationist, noting that with a little sensible management the South Shetland fur seal population could have provided a sustainable annual harvest of about 100,000 skins. Instead, greed had destroyed the breeding population.\nWeddell's first destination was the little-explored South Orkney Islands. On January 15, 1823 he collected six skins of a new\nspecies of seal, the one that would later bear his name (Leptonychotes weddelli). Finding few fur seals, Weddell carefully charted the islands, then began to search in uncharted waters. He headed south for a while, then scoured the sea between the South Orkneys and the South Sandwich Islands. Finally deciding that if there was any new land it must be to the south, he once again set course that way. By February 17, 1823 Weddell was deep into the Weddell Sea. On February 20, at longitude 34°16'45\"W, James Weddell fixed his position at 74°15'S, further south than anyone had ever gone before. It would be over 80 years before anyone could get that far south again in the Weddell Sea.\nIn 1830, the Enderby Brothers sent another captain, John Biscoe, south to look for seals and make new discoveries. Sailing in the\nsmall brig Tula and accompanied by the cutter Lively, Biscoe crossed the Antarctic Circle on January 22, 1831. On February 28, he sighted a headland he called Cape Ann (now Mount Biscoe) and the mountain tops of what he called Enderby Land. After wintering in Tasmania and nursing his crew back from scurvy, Biscoe headed south and east again. By the end of April, 1832, John Biscoe had become the third person to circumnavigate Antarctica. In the second year of the voyage he discovered Adelaide Island, the Pitts Islands, and the Biscoe Islands, and he had made the first landing on Anvers Island. He also made two other notable contributions to Antarctic geography and navigation: he informed the Hydrographer in London that the headlands he had seen were certainly those of a continent, and he advised all future voyagers that the prevailing winds in very high latitudes blow east to west.\nIn 1833, Peter Kemp, a sealer working for the rival firm of Bennett and Sons, was sent south to find seals, not make new\ndiscoveries. Nonetheless, on December 29 Kemp sighted a stretch of coast just east of Biscoe's discovery. (He didn't name it, but the area is now called Kemp Land.) Pack ice prevented him from landing, so he set a course to Kergulen Island and there hunted elephant seals for their oil.\nThe last of the great Enderby captains was John Balleny, who sailed from England in 1838 aboard the schooner Eliza Scott,\naccompanied by Thomas Freeman in the Sabrina. Like John Biscoe, Balleny's primary mission was to search for new land. On February 9, 1839, just south of the Antarctic Circle and sailing\n\n west as Biscoe had recommended, he sighted islands. It was two days before weather permitted a close approach and landing. Captain Freeman and a few men from the Sabrina rowed in and Freeman jumped out onto the beach long enough to grab a few stones. Brief as it was, this was the first landing below the Antarctic Circle. The islands are now called the Balleny Islands.\nOn March 2, at 64°58'S and 121°08'E, Balleny caught his one and only glimpse of the Antarctic continent, an area now\ncalled the Sabrina Coast. Perhaps the most important contribution to Antarctic exploration made by John Balleny was his observation that a possible passageway through the pack ice existed between 170°E and 180°E longitude. This would be the path followed by James Clark Ross, Carsten Borchgrevink, Robert Scott, Ernest Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen.\nOnly twenty years had passed between Smith's discovery of the South Shetlands and the end of Balleny's voyage. In that time\nthe rough outlines of the new continent had been sketched, and nearly all commercially valuable seals had been extirpated. Sealing activity had nearly ceased, but even as the sealers left governments once again became interested in the great land to the south.\nInspired by Weddell's deep foray into the Weddell Sea and by the tantalizing glimpses of land reported by the sealers, the\nFrench, British, and United States governments launched exploratory missions. All of them had two goals: discover new land and locate the south magnetic pole.\nThe first to sail was Jules-Sbastien- Csar Dumont d'Urville in the Astrolabe, with Charles Hector Jacquinot in the Zle as consort. During late February to early March 1838, d'Urville charted parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.\nAfter spending the austral winter sailing across the Pacific from Chile to Australia, d'Urville headed south to search for the magnetic pole. During this second southern excursion his ships got to within four miles of the continent. On January 21, 1839, several of his men landed on a small islet a few hundred meters offshore and claimed all the land they had seen for France. Dumont d'Urville named it Terre Adlie (Adlie Land) for his wife.\nThe American expedition was commanded by Lt. Charles Wilkes. His United States Exploring Expedition comprised six ships\n\n and 433 men, making it the largest expedition ever dispatched to explore the southern ocean. The fleet sailed in August 1838 with several naturalists and scientists. Wilkes' first foray to the south, in the Peninsula region, brought no new discoveries. On his second excursion, however, he charted several hundred miles of new coastline, starting with Cape Hudson in Terre Adlie on January 16, 1840 and ending with what is now called the Shackleton Ice Shelf on February 21. (There were several inaccuracies in Wilkes' positions, however, such that James Clark Ross later sailed over some areas where Wilkes had drawn land on his charts.) As with d'Urville, ice prevented Wilkes from reaching the magnetic pole, but much of the area he charted is now known as Wilkes Land.\nDumont d'Urville had been sent south largely to extend French influence in the southern ocean, and Wilkes had been instructed\nto chart the dangerous southern seas. Their searches for the magnetic pole had been secondary. James Clark Ross, on the other hand, was specifically tasked with finding the elusive pole. He had already found the north magnetic pole (in 1831), so it seemed fitting that he should search for the southern one.\nRoss left England in early October 1839, in command of two ships. Ross' flagship was the Erebus, and Commander Francis\nCrozier was in command of the Terror. The men spent the 1840 austral winter in Australia, where Ross read of d'Urville's and Wilkes' discoveries. Their experiences convinced him to sail further east before bearing south. It was a key decision. On January 9, 1841, Ross pushed through the pack ice and into the Ross Sea. Two days later he sighted the most southerly land yet, a range of mountains he named the Admiralty Range. On January 12 he landed on Possession Island and claimed the land, which he called Victoria Land, for England.\nBy January 22, Ross had beat Weddell's furthest south. Discoveries followed one after the other. On January 27 he landed on\nand claimed Franklin Island. The next day, he discovered and named Mounts Erebus and Terror on Ross Island. His ships' southerly advance was stopped finally by the Ross Ice Shelf (which Ross called the Victoria Barrier). James Ross had sailed as far south as it is possible to do. He had also discovered that the south magnetic pole lay inland, inaccessible by sea.\nHis next two excursions south brought no further discoveries. On the second, in the 1841-42 austral summer, the Erebus and\nTerror were nearly destroyed by collisions with icebergs and each other. On his third excursion, in March of 1843, Ross managed to reach 71°30'S in the Weddell Sea before the ice pack forced him north.\nAfter Ross' voyages there was, with a few notable exceptions, a fifty year hiatus in Antarctic exploration. The attentions of\ngovernments turned to the Arctic and the search for the Northwest Passage. However, commerce continued between Europe and the countries of the southern hemisphere. In one case, this resulted in a serendipitous discovery.\n\n American merchant captain John Heard was sailing a great circle course in the southern ocean on his way from Boston to\nMelbourne when, on November 25, 1853, he sighted land. It was an island not found on any chart, and it was soon to be named Heard Island. (On January 4, 1854 the British Captain William McDonald discovered the group of islands lying to the west of Heard Island; the McDonald Islands.) It didn't take long for the hunters to follow up on Heard's discovery. There was an abundance of elephant seals on the island and by 1855 whalers (turned sealer) had landed and begun harvesting the crop. By 1880 over four million gallons of elephant seal oil had been rendered and shipped from Heard Island.\nAnother notable exception was the scientific voyage of the HMS Challenger. During her around-the-world oceanographic cruise,\nshe became the first steamship to cross the Antarctic Circle (on February 16, 1874). In dredging the ocean bottom, her crew discovered continental rocks deposited by icebergs, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Antarctica was a continent.\nDuring the early part of the nineteenth century, whalers had ventured further south to look for additional stocks of the\nrapidly disappearing southern right whales. They found only fast swimming rorquals for which their rowboats were no match, so these men fell back on taking fur and elephant seals. By 1825, most of the seals had been wiped out. Beginning in 1850, petroleum oil began to compete with whale oil, and by 1872 the number of whaling ships had dropped from 400 to 72.\nThe need for baleen kept the industry going, however. The invention of steam engines and explosive harpoons soon cleared\nnorthern waters of whales, so whalers once again made a tentative probe to the south. Their search for prey brought new geographical discoveries.\nThe first reconnaissance mission arrived in the southern ocean in 1873. It was German, under the command of Captain E.\nDal!mann. His was the first steam whaler to work Antarctic waters, but it was still no match for the rorquals. Dal!mann managed to take a few fur and elephant seals (their populations were by now recovering somewhat from the depredations of earlier in the century) but no whales. During his time around the Peninsula in 1873 and 1874, Dal!mann discovered the Bismarck Strait and the Neumayer Channel.\n\n Dallmann's experience was sufficiently discouraging to keep other whalers away for another twenty years. Then, in 1892,\nthe Dundee Expedition headed south to search for the whales that Ross had reported seeing in the Weddell Sea. Again, no right whales were taken, but his four ships returned home with holds full of seal skins and oil. These whalers also discovered Dundee Island.\nDuring the same 1892-93 austral summer, a Norwegian whaling expedition under Captain Carl Anton Larsen was exploring the\nwaters and shores of Graham Land. Again, only seal skins and seal oil were taken but the owner of the ship, whaling magnate Christen Christensen, sent it south again in 1893-1894 to investigate the Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas. Captain Larsen explored coasts on both sides of the Peninsula, discovering Foyn Land and King Oscar II Land. He also discovered petrified wood on Seymour Island. As in the previous season, he found no right whales but did bring home more seal skins and oil.\nThese and other opportunistic hunts in the latter part of the nineteenth century once again reduced the barely recovered Antarctic\nseal fur populations to near zero. Deciding to seek right whales in the Ross Sea, Norwegian businessman Henryk Bull and whaler Svend Foyn financed the 1893-94 whaling expedition of the ship Antarctic, commanded by Captain L. Kristensen. Carsten Borchgrevink, a Norwegian immigrant, joined the ship in Australia. After taking seals in the sub- Antarctic islands, the crew of the Antarctic made for the Ross Sea. On January 16, 1895 they sighted Cape Adare but the ice kept them offshore. They landed on Possession Island and Borchgrevink discovered lichen on the rocks, the first time vegetation had been seen in the deep Antarctic. On January 24 they were able to land at Cape Adare, the first landing on the continent since Davis, and the first ever on the continental mainland. Several biological and geological specimens were collected before the crew headed back to Australia.\nThis landing, and the specimens collected, were to provide the fuel for the greatest upsurge in Antarctic exploration yet seen.\nIn July of 1895, participants in the Sixth International Geographical Congress called for further exploration of the Antarctic regions.\nScientists and explorers from Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, Scotland, Norway, Australia, and Japan soon heeded the call. Nearly all of the resulting expeditions were designed from the outset to conduct scientific investigations. The reasons for activity in the Antarctic had\n\n begun to shift away from profit and toward science (with a fair measure of national pride thrown in).\nThe Belgian Antarctic Expedition left Antwerp in August of 1897, under the command of Lt. Adrien Victor Joseph de Gerlache. Roald\nAmundsen, who fourteen years later would be the first person to reach the south pole, had signed on as the mate. By January 1898, the Belgica was off the west coast of the Peninsula (Graham Land). In the next two months, Gerlache discovered Gerlache Strait and Brabant, Lige, Anvers, and Wiencke Islands. He continued south into thickening pack ice, and by February 28, at 70°20'S, he was completely trapped.\nWhether Gerlache intended his expedition to winter in the Antarctic is unknown, but winter they did, and most of the crew were\nnot prepared for it. During the long, cold, winter night they suffered psychological problems, including depression and insanity. The situation may have been worse had not Dr. Frederick Cook, the ship's surgeon, taken charge of morale and devised ways to keep the mens' spirits up until the sun returned. Finally, on March 14, 1899, after drifting for 13 months across 17 degrees of longitude, the Belgica was freed from the ice to sail home.\nEvery other expedition of this period was initiated with the express intention of wintering all or part of the crew.\nOn December 19, 1898 Carsten Borchgrevink departed Hobart, Tasmania in the Southern Cross. He had raised the funds for\nand was in command of the first scientific expedition intending to spend a winter on the continent of Antarctica: the British Antarctic Expedition, 1898-1900. (It was so named because the wealthy British publisher Sir George Newnes had sponsored it. Only three of its members were actually British.) On February 18, 1899 Borchgrevink landed and established camp at Cape Adare.\nBorchgrevink, nine other men, and 75 dogs spent the winter carrying out survey trips and collecting samples and meteorological\ndata. The expedition zoologist, Hanson, died and was the first person to be buried on the Antarctic mainland. The Southern Cross returned in late January 1900 to pick up the remaining winter-overs. They proceeded south to make several landings--at Possession Island, Coulman Island, on the continent at the foot of Mount Melbourne, and on Ross Island. On February 16, Borchgrevink and two others climbed the Ross Ice Shelf and sledged south to 78°50'S. This was further south than anyone had ever gone, and it marked the beginning of humankind's penetration into the vast Antarctic interior.\nErich von Drygalski led a well provisioned, well prepared German expedition to Antarctica, arriving there in January of 1902.\nDrygalski planned to winter near the coast to carry out his scientific studies. However, on the same day he sighted and named Kaiser Wilhelm II Land, his ship, the Gauss, became trapped\n\n in the pack ice near 90?E, preventing him from getting any closer. This didn't prevent him from carrying out as much of his planned research as he could. In March, 1902, Drygalski made a balloon ascent. (It wasn't the first--Captain Robert Falcon Scott, on the other side of the continent, had beaten him by a few days.) During the winter, several sledging expeditions made it to the shore to carry out scientific studies. The next summer, fearful that they'd be trapped for another winter, Drygalski had his men lay a trail of garbage across the ice from the ship to open water, 600 meters away. The idea was to increase solar absorption and soften the ice so it would break up more readily. The scheme worked, and the Gauss was freed from the ice on February 8, 1903.\nFive days before the Gauss had sailed from Germany (in August 1901), Robert Scott's first Antarctic expedition, the National\nAntarctic Expedition, left England aboard the ship Discovery. This was the first British vessel built specifically for scientific exploration in high latitudes. One of the main goals of this expedition was to reach the geographic south pole.\nAfter investigating the Ross Ice Shelf and discovering King Edward VII Land, Scott decided on Ross Island as the place to set up his winter camp. Three huts were built on the shores of Hut Point, at the mouth of Winter Quarters\nBay. Discovery promptly became frozen in, and she stayed that way for the next two years. Scott and his men made good use of the time. Numerous exploratory sledge trips were made from camp, discovering, naming, and mapping out new territory and geographic landmarks. Three journeys were of note: In an attempt to reach the south pole, Scott, Edward Wilson, and Ernest Shackleton reached 82°16'S on December 30, 1902. Snowblindness, an inadequate diet, and slow progress finally forced them to turn around. On January 4, 1903 a sledge team led by Albert Armitage was the first to reach the top of the polar plateau. And in November 1903, Scott led a team into the interior of the continent along the path established by Armitage.\nGeologist Otto Nordenskjld's Swedish Expedition, with former whaling captain C.A. Larsen commanding the ship Antarctic, arrived in the South Shetlands on January 11, 1902. In February, Nordenskjld was put ashore\nwith five others on Snow Hill Island to spend the winter. The following year, while on its way to retrieve the Nordenskjld party, the Antarctic was beset and destroyed by pack ice. Nordenskjld and his companions, unaware of the fate that had befallen their vessel, resigned themselves to another winter when the ship failed to appear.\nLarsen had put three men ashore at Hope Bay to search for Nordenskjld, in case the ship was unable to penetrate the ice. When\nthey found their way to Snow Hill Island blocked by open water, they returned to Hope Bay to wait. The Antarctic never came back to pick them up, though, and they were forced to spend the winter of 1903 in dismal conditions. They built a makeshift stone and ice shelter and survived on meager supplies and penguin meat.\n\n Meanwhile, after the ship was lost, the rest of the crew laboriously made their way over broken sea ice to Paulet Island for the\nwinter. They too built a stone hut and survived on penguin and seal meat. On October 12, 1903, the Snow Hill and Hope Bay parties met near Vega Island, then both groups returned to Snow Hill Island. The Argentinean ship Uruguay rescued everyone in November of 1903.\nThe Scottish National Antarctic Expedition had landed on Saddle Island in the South Orkneys on February 3, 1903. After a brief\nforay into the Weddell Sea, the Scotia, under William Bruce, returned to the South Orkneys to set up a winter camp at Scotia Bay on Laurie Island. The Scotia became frozen into the bay and wasn't freed until November. During the winter, crew members built the first station for scientific research, a stone hut meteorological laboratory called Omond House. The following season, Bruce and the crew of the Scotia made another foray into the Weddell where they discovered Coats Land. The Scottish Expedition conducted more science and collected more unknown specimens than any previous expedition.\nThe French Expedition, under Jean- Baptiste Charcot, settled in for the austral winter of 1904 in a bay on the coast of Booth Island,\nnear 65°S on the western side of Graham Land. They conducted surveys and collected data and samples until their ship, the Francais, was freed in December. Exploring further south, the ship struck a submerged rock in January, 1905 and the expedition was cut short.\nErnest Shackleton's first expedition left New Zealand on New Year's Day, 1908 in the ship Nimrod. His primary goal was to attain\nthe geographic south pole. After settling on Cape Royds, Ross Island as a wintering spot, Shackleton landed on February 3 and set up camp. Douglas Mawson was part of this team. He, Edgeworth David, and four others made the first ascent of Mount Erebus. Two other notable accomplishments were made during the expedition. On January 9, 1909 Shackleton and his pole party made it to a furthest south of 88°23'S on the polar plateau, a mere 97 miles from the pole, before being forced to turn around. On a separate journey, Mawson, David, and Alistair Mackay were the first humans to reach the long-sought-after south magnetic pole, claiming that victory for Britain on January 15.\nMeanwhile, Charcot had organized a second French Expedition, which left Punta Arenas, Chile on December 16, 1908. On January\n1, 1909, as Shackleton was still trudging south on the other side of the continent, Charcot discovered a natural harbor at Petermann Island, which he named Port Circumcision (after Bouvet's famous Cape Circumcision). Soon afterwards his ship, the Pourquois-pas?, ran aground on a hidden reef. Repairs were made at Petermann Island and Charcot headed south to continue his work of charting the coast of Graham Land and all offshore islands (work he had begun on the first expedition). He discovered and named Marguerite Bay, then returned to Petermann Island to prepare for winter.\n\n The crew of the Pourquois-pas? built four huts for scientific work and spent the winter of 1909 gathering data. The following summer,\nCharcot headed south once more, discovering new land on the other side of Alexander Island. Charcot named it Charcot Land after his father, then turned his damaged ship north for good. In their three seasons in Antarctica, Charcot had surpassed everyone by a wide margin, even Bruce, in the volume and quality of his charts and scientific observations. In all, he had surveyed 1250 miles of coastline and new territory.\nThe final assault on the south pole began in January 1911 with the arrival of RoaId Amundsen and his ship, the Fram, at the Bay of Whales\nand Robert Scott in the Terra Nova at Cape Evans, Ross Island. Both built substantial camps and settled in for the winter. On October 20, Amundsen and four others set out with sledges and dog teams to make the pole. On November 11, he spotted and named the Queen Maud Range. He passed Shackleton's furthest south on December 8, and on December 14, 1911, Amundsen and his team reached the geographic south pole.\nWhere Amundsen's overriding goal was to make the pole, Scott had planned substantial scientific studies as well. He sent a\nwestern party out to explore the Dry Valleys and the Koettlitz Glacier. A northern party was deposited at Cape Adare in February 1911, where they repaired Borchgrevink's two huts and built a third winter hut of their own. They spent the winter making exploratory surveys of the Victoria Land coast.\nEdward Wilson, Birdy Bowers, and Apsley Cherry-Garrard embarked on a winter overland trip from Cape Evans to Cape Crozier to\ncollect emperor penguin eggs. It was to be a journey forever labeled as \"The Worst Journey in the World.\" The men endured temperatures below -50°C (one time as low as -61°C) for days on end and were battered relentlessly by vicious storms. But they survived to bring eggs back to Cape Evans.\n\n n November 1, 1911 Robert Scott and his party left for the south pole. Where Amundsen had used sled dogs, Scott's party manhauled their\nsledges over rough snow and treacherous glaciers. The going was slow and difficult. On January 9, 1912, they reached Shackleton's furthest south. Finally, on January 17, they reached the pole, only to find Amundsen's tent and a Norwegian flag waiting for them. The sight destroyed their morale. Short of food and pinned in their tent several times by storms, all five of the pole party members died on the return trip.\nIn the meantime, on January 3, the northern party had been retrieved by the Terra Nova and dropped off for a brief survey at Terra\nNova Bay. However, the ship couldn't get through the ice in February to pick them up and the six men were forced to spend a second winter, one for which they were not at all prepared. They lived in an ice cave on Inexpressible Island, under the most grueling conditions imaginable. They survived on seal meat and stayed warm by burning seal blubber. On September 30, 1912, coated with blubber grease and with their clothes in tatters, they made a break for Cape Evans. They arrived intact after a 40 day march.\nOn the other side of the continent, the second German Antarctic Expedition was steaming south in the Deutschland, under the\ncommand of Wilhelm Filchner. Filchner's plan was to make the first overland traverse to determine if a channel connected the Weddell and Ross Seas. On January 30, 1912, he sighted new land at almost 78°S in the Weddell Sea. It had taken 89 years, but someone had finally bested Weddell's furthest south on that side of the continent.\nThe land he discovered is now called the Luitpold Coast, and the previously unseen ice shelf where Filchner started to set up camp is named the Filchner Ice Shelf. However, the ice shelf broke up under them and ruined\nFilchner's plans. Their nearly finished camp hut was suddenly on a drifting iceberg and had to be quickly dismantled. The Deutschland ended up trapped in the pack ice and spent the winter drifting in the Weddell Sea. The Germans at least were able to collect some scientific data during their nine month imprisonment.\n\n Between 1910 and 1912, a Japanese Expedition under Lt. Nobu Shirase surveyed parts of the Ross Sea, reaching\nCoulman Island in 1911 and the Ross Ice Shelf on January 16, 1912, just one day before Scott reached the pole. This expedition was ill prepared and ill supported and accomplished little of consequence except to establish a brief Japanese presence in the new land.\nIn early January 1912, Douglas Mawson, leading the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, discovered and named Commonwealth\nBay. On January 8, he established a camp on a rocky promontory he called Cape Denison. By the time he realized he had selected the most relentlessly windy place on Earth, it was too late. Once the Cape Denison camp was under construction, the ship left to deposit the eight-man \"western party\" at the Shackleton Ice Shelf, where another camp was established. During the course of the next year, the western party mapped large areas of Queen Mary Land and discovered new penguin rookeries.\nMawson's group at Commonwealth Bay surveyed and mapped sections of George V Land and attempted to reach the south\nmagnetic pole. On one sledging trip, Mawson lost both of his partners (one in a crevasse and the other to vitamin A poisoning) and very nearly perished himself. On one occasion he fell into a crevasse and had to extricate himself. Because he didn't return to Cape Denison in time to be picked up by his ship, he and several others were forced to spend a second winter. They were finally rescued on December 24, 1913.\nMawson's expedition is notable for several firsts. He established the first flagged road over the otherwise trackless snow. He\ndiscovered the first meteorite in Antarctica. Most notably, as a harbinger of what was to come, Mawson brought the first airplane to Antarctica (even though it never flew) and was the first to use a radio. In February 1913, two-way radio communication was established between Cape Denison and Macquarie Island. The airplane and radio would soon transform Antarctic exploration.\nThe final major expedition of the heroic era began when Ernest Shackleton left England in the ship Endurance on August 8,\n1914. Shackleton's plan was to make the Weddell Sea-Ross Sea traverse that Filchner had envisioned but failed to accomplish. However, like Filchner, Shackleton became trapped in the Weddell Sea pack ice and drifted through the winter. Ultimately, the Endurance was crushed by the ice and sank on November 21, 1915. There followed the most incredible survival story in Antarctic history.\nShackleton and his men dragged and rowed their lifeboats over the ice and through the occasional lead until they made it to\nElephant Island. From there, Shackleton and five others set out in the largest of the boats, the 6-meter James Caird, to cross 800 miles of the stormiest seas in the world. After fifteen grueling days, they arrived at the southern shore of South Georgia Island. Rough seas delayed their\n\n landing for two days. Shackleton and two others then climbed across the island (with no food, water, or shelter) to reach the whaling station at Stromness Bay.\nMeanwhile, the twenty-two men left on Elephant Island survived by using upturned boats as shelters. Food was meager; at times\nthey were reduced to eating stewed seal bones and seaweed. Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts, Shackleton returned to rescue them in the Chilean trawler Yelcho, 105 days after they had arrived.\nShackleton also had a party in the Ross Sea whose job it was to lay depots for the traverse team. These men became stranded\nwhen their ship blew away in a blizzard and were forced to winter at Cape Evans and Hut Point on supplies left over by Robert Scott. The men trapped at Hut Point (after laying depots for the now-nonexistent traverse) had it particularly bad. One died of scurvy and two others were lost in a blizzard. The remaining men were finally rescued in January of 1917.\nBetween 1920 and 1922 there were two other expeditions, but they accomplished little of consequence. One was the British Imperial\nExpedition, under John Cope, and the other was Ernest Shackleton's final expedition, led by Frank Wild after Shackleton died on South Georgia.\nIn the 27 years since Carsten Borchgrevink first set foot on Cape Adare, Antarctica had seen seventeen expeditions from\neight countries.\nEven though Norway's late nineteenth century whaling expeditions to the Antarctic had not been successful, declining\nwhale stocks in northern waters forced that country's whaling firms to take yet another look at the southern ocean. Whaling technology had improved by the early twentieth century; the advent of faster catcher boats and explosive harpoons finally permitted the taking of rorquals. The industry was re-established in Antarctic waters in 1904, when the first shore station was built at Grytviken on South Georgia Island by Captain C.A. Larsen. The first whale, a humpback, was taken by a steam powered catcher on December 22, 1904. Between December 1904 and February 1906, 236 whales were killed and processed at Grytviken.\nIn 1906, whaling magnate Christen Christensen sent the first factory ship to the South Shetlands. Soon other shore stations had\n\n been set up, including one at Deception Island. By 1912, there were six shore stations, 21 factory ships, and 62 catchers in Antarctica. That year, 10,760 whales were killed. The early factory ships had a limited range and were little more than floating oil cookeries. Whales were tied alongside for flensing, so relatively calm waters were required. In 1926, though, a new kind of factory ship entered Antarctic waters, one equipped with a chute for hauling whole whales on board. With this, Antarctic whaling entered a new phase.\nAccompanied by their catchers, these ships could roam widely to seek out and exploit new hunting grounds. This freedom, in\nturn, permitted the whalers to engage in exploration. Though their primary business was the capture of whales, whalers (most of them Norwegian) began to spend considerable time exploring and mapping the coast and waters of Antarctica. Lars Christensen, the son of Christen Christensen and heir to the whaling company his father founded, was particularly interested in making geographical discoveries and gave his captains wide latitude to do so. Between 1927 and 1937, Christensen's men discovered and surveyed substantial new land on the Queen Maud Land and Mac- Robertson Land coasts. On February 20, 1935 Captain Klarius Mikkelsen discovered the ice-free Vestfold Hills. His wife, Caroline, accompanied him as he stepped ashore and became the first woman to set foot in Antarctica.\nAlarmed by the diminishing stock of whales, the British government established the Discovery Committee in 1923. The committee's\njob was to conduct research on whale behavior, biology, and distribution. Members of the committee, using Robert Scott's ship Discovery, began work on South Georgia in early 1925. Thus began the first major scientific study in Antarctica. To complement their work on whales, Discovery scientists also conducted extensive hydrographic and biological work in the southern ocean. A second ship, the William Scoresby, was enlisted for whale marking and mid-water trawling. The Discovery II was built to replace the aging original, and between the years 1931- 1933 became the fourth ship to circumnavigate the continent, 100 years after John Biscoe's Tula.\nThe Discovery Committee's work ultimately led to whale conservation recommendations and regulations. In 1931, 26 countries\nagreed to a regulatory convention which entered into force in 1936. In 1937, nine countries agreed to minimum size restrictions. Nonetheless, during the 1937-1938 season, over 46,000 whales were killed, 9000 of them immature. By 1965, the industry was in decline, having committed the same error and suffered the same fate as the sealing industry before it.\n\n The advent of more powerful engines, steel hulled ships, airplanes, and radios considerably enhanced the whalers' ability to\nhunt successfully in Antarctica. At the same time, these technological improvements greatly advanced the cause and execution of Antarctic exploration. The radio was particularly important; for the first time, Antarctic explorers were not completely isolated from the rest of the world.\nOne of the first to use the new aeronautical technology was Sir Hubert Wilkins. In an expedition supported by publisher\nRandolph Hearst and the American Geographical Society, Wilkins made the first Antarctic flight on November 16, 1928. On December 20, from a base at Deception Island, Wilkins flew over Graham Land and became the first Antarctic explorer to discover new land by air. He was also the first to use aerial photography for mapping.\nRichard Byrd's first Antarctic expedition reached the Ross Ice Shelf on December 25, 1928. He had with him three airplanes,\n95 dogs, and over 50 men. His goal was to fly over the south pole. After establishing his Little America camp at the Bay of Whales, Byrd made his first flight on January 15, 1929. On a flight two weeks later, he discovered the Rockefeller Mountains. Several other reconnaissance flights were made, then the planes were stored and the men settled in for the winter.\nThe next austral summer, on November 28, 1929, Byrd and three others took off in their Ford Tr -motor and headed south.\nAfter a harrowing climb over the Transantarctic Mountains, Byrd and his crew became the first to fly over the south pole, at 1:14 in the morning on November 29, 1929.\nAt the same time, Douglas Mawson was back in the Antarctic, leading the British-Australian-New Zealand Antarctic Research\nExpedition (BANZARE). Their goal was to conduct air explorations of the Mac-Robertson, Princess Elizabeth, Wilhelm II, Queen Mary, Wilkes, Adlie, George V, and Oates Land Coasts. On January 14, 1930, Mawson crossed paths with Captain Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, who was surveying the coast and waters of Dronning Maud Land. The Norwegian expedition had been organized by whaler and ship owner Lars Christensen, who had directed Riiser-Larsen to circumnavigate the continent, make surveys (some by air), and take scientific samples. The two men mutually agreed to limit their respective explorations to either side of the 45th eastern meridian. (Informal as it was, this was the first international Antarctic territorial agreement.)\nRichard Byrd returned to Antarctica with another expedition on January 17, 1934, this time with scientific research as his primary\ngoal. After re-occupying Little America for the winter, he and his team set about their work, which included more survey and mapping flights, ground-based geology, meteorology, biology, and atmospheric studies. Richard Byrd spent most of the winter alone at an inland camp, the Bolling Advance Weather Station, where he nearly perished from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n This expedition could boast two notable accomplishments; Byrd proved once and for all that Antarctica was a single continent\nand that there was no channel between the Weddell and Ross Seas. This was also the first expedition to successfully use motorized transport on the ice (three Citron tractors).\nThe next year, John Rymill led the British Graham Land Expedition in a two-year aerial and sledge mapping effort on the\nPeninsula. The first winter (1935) was spent on a base in the Argentine Islands and the following winter (1936) in the Debenham Islands. Rymill discovered more fossils and, notably, put to rest the notion that there were ice-filled channels connecting the east and west sides of the Peninsula.\nWhile Rymill was conducting his surveys on the west side of the Peninsula, the wealthy American Lincoln Ellsworth was at\nDundee Island at the tip of the Peninsula, preparing to fly across the continent to the Ross Sea. This was to be his third attempt. The first, in January 1934, had been aborted when the plane was damaged and the second, in January 1935, had been canceled because of poor weather conditions. On November 23, 1935 Ellsworth and his pilot, Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, took to the air and headed south for what they anticipated would be a 14 hour flight. Twenty-two days later they trudged into Byrd's abandoned Little America camp, having had to finish the last 16 miles of the journey on foot when they ran out of fuel. Though they had been forced down by weather several times, they had nonetheless succeeded in being the first people to fly across the continent. They had also been the first to land and take off in unknown territory. During the journey, they had discovered the Ellsworth Mountains.\nLincoln Ellsworth returned to Antarctica in 1938-39 to make inland flights and claim land for America, claims that the U.S.\ngovernment never pursued.\nIn 1938, Hermann Gring dispatched an expedition to map and claim vast areas of Dronning Maud Land for the Third Reich. (At the\ntime of the Germans' departure, the area had not been formally claimed.) Flights penetrated 370 miles inland to take aerial photographs, but the resulting maps were useless because they lacked ground measurement controls. The Germans also dropped hundreds of aluminum darts inscribed with swastikas in an attempt to demonstrate occupancy of the land.\nThroughout the history of Antarctic exploration, most expeditions had been privately funded. This pattern was particularly prevalent\n\n during the heroic era and up until the late 1930s (though in many cases a little government backing was thrown in). Most of these expeditions also owed their existence to their strongly self-motivated and often charismatic leaders. This pattern began to end as competition for whale stocks heated up, and as more and more government officials began to realize the potential strategic, economic, and scientific importance of the last continent. Governments began to lay claim to vast tracts of land, basing their claims on the prior discoveries of their countrymen or, in two cases, on the 1498 papal proclamation dividing the world between Portugal and Spain.\nThe oldest continuously occupied station is the weather station on Laurie Island in the South Orkneys, turned over to Argentina by\nW.S. Bruce in 1904. This history of occupancy forms a key element of the Argentinean claim to the Peninsula, but the first formal claim over Antarctic territory was made by Britain in 1908. In 1923 Britain handed over part of their claim, the Ross Dependencies, to New Zealand. In 1924, France laid claim to Terre Adlie. Australia claimed a large chunk of territory in 1933. In January 1939, Norway formalized its claim to Dronning Maud Land (largely to protect its whaling interests and preempt the anticipated claims of the German Schwabenland Expedition). Finally, in 1940, Chile became the third country to claim sovereignty over the Antarctic Peninsula (after Britain and Argentina).\nAlthough the United States pursued no claims of its own, the flurry of international land grabbing may have encouraged the U.S.\nCongress to establish the U.S. Antarctic Service in 1939. From that moment on, the U.S. government assumed almost complete control of American Antarctic exploration. Other countries were soon to follow suit.\nThe U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition, commanded by Richard Byrd, arrived at the Bay of Whales in November of 1939.\nUnlike his first two expeditions, most of the personnel this time were military and the entire mission was funded by and under the auspices of the U.S. government. Two bases were established: West Base at the Bay of Whales and East Base at Marguerite Bay on the Peninsula. After hunkering in for the winter of 1940, scientific parties were sent out during the summer of 1940-41 for what amounted to a major research effort. War threatened, however, and both bases were closed and evacuated by March, 1941.\nWorld War II interrupted any further research efforts in Antarctica, but the continent was not immune to wartime activity. On the night\nof January 13, 1941, German commandos boarded and captured two Norwegian factory ships in the sea north of Dronning Maud Land. By the end of the next day, the Germans had taken possession of three factory ships and eleven catchers. The German Navy subsequently used the waters of the Peninsula and the sub- Antarctic islands as a haven from which they could venture forth to attack allied shipping. Their main base was an obscure harbor on Kergulen Island. Mines laid by this German Antarctic fleet around the ports of Australia sank the first American vessel lost to enemy action.\n\n In response to this activity, the British set up secret bases on Deception and Wiencke Islands and at Hope Bay. The Hope Bay\nbase was destroyed by fire and evacuated in November of 1948. (When the British returned to re-establish the camp in 1952, an Argentine military party tried to prevent them from doing so by firing shots over the British heads. These may have been the first shots fired between competing claimants in Antarctica. Subsequently, Argentina and Britain went to war over the Falkland Islands and South Georgia in 1982.)\nAlmost immediately after the Second World War, modem, high-profile, government Antarctic activities began in earnest. In 1946 the\nUnited States launched the U.S. Navy's Antarctic Developments Project (also known as Operation Highjump). It was an exercise with a largely threefold purpose: provide cold environment training for the Navy, investigate potential Antarctic base sites, and establish a major U.S. presence in the Antarctic. All the new technology developed during the war would be brought to bear in the cause of scientific exploration. The Highjump expedition, still the largest single Antarctic expedition ever launched, entered the Ross Sea ice pack on December 31, 1946 with thirteen ships, 23 aircraft, and over 4700 men.\nThe task force was split into three groups, each with its own area to map and explore. Little America IV was established on the\nRoss Ice Shelf and mapping survey flights began. Over the next two months three major mountain ranges were discovered, the snow-free Bunger Hills were discovered, a weather station was set up at the Rockefeller Mountains, helicopters were used for the first time in Antarctica, hundreds of miles of new coastline were seen, and Admiral Richard Byrd flew over the south pole for the second time. In all, Highjump pilots flew a total of nearly 23,000 miles exploring the continent. Highjump also marked the first time an icebreaker was used in Antarctica. By March, 1947 the entire task force was heading home.\nThe next season (1948-1949) the Navy returned with the less ambitious Second Antarctic Developments Project (Operation\nWindmill) to take ground sightings. These sightings were used to construct maps from the many aerial photos taken during Operation Highjump.\nAt the same time Operation Highjump was winding down, what would be the last privately organized expedition to Antarctica\nfor many years was sailing into the waters of the Peninsula. It was called the Ronne Expedition, under the command of Finn Ronne, a former member of Byrd's Antarctic Service Expedition. Ronne arrived at Stonington Island on March 12, 1947. His plan was to map previously uncharted territory at the southern ends of the Antarctic Peninsula and in the southwestern Weddell Sea. Like most other expedition organizers before him, Ronne had planned on spending the winter. Before leaving Antarctica in February of 1948 (after its ship was freed by the icebreakers of Operation Windmill), the Ronne Expedition had achieved its major objectives,\n\n and it bore the distinction of being the first expedition in history to have women as winter-over members.\nBetween February 1950 and January 1952, a Swedish-British- Norwegian international scientific expedition conducted\nglaciological and geological research from a temporary base (Maudheim) in Dronning Maud Land. The team occupied the base continuously for two winters and two summers. The main purpose of the expedition was to investigate and verify some of the findings of the German Schwabenland expedition, particularly in terms of the condition and depth of the ice sheet. However, the scientists also discovered unusual lichens, a moss, and two tiny mites, the continent's largest land animals.\nBy the late 1940s Antarctic exploration had entered a new phase, and one not just due to increased government\ninvolvement. For the first time in history, permanent bases were established. The British had been the first when they erected their secret bases in the closing days of the war. Once their existence was known, however, the scramble to occupy the continent was on. On January 29, 1947 Argentina established a base at Gamma Island. A week later, a Chilean expedition set up a base on Greenwich Island in the South Shetlands. After that, base building escalated for the three nations laying claim to the Antarctic Peninsula. By the end of 1955, Argentina, Chile, and Britain had created twenty-one stations in the Peninsula region.\nIn January of 1950, France established a small, temporary station in Terre Adlie, near where Dumont d'Urville had made his\nfirst landfall. (This base was later re-occupied for the International Geophysical Year.) And in 1954, Australia constructed its first base in East Antarctica. Mawson Station was the first large, permanent base built specifically for scientific research.\nIn addition to the desire to give legitimacy to territorial claims by establishing occupancy, some of the base construction was in\nanticipation of the upcoming International Geophysical Year (IGY). The IGY had been conceived in 1950 as a continuation of the spirit and work of the International Polar Years of 1882- 1883 and 1932-1933. Most of the polar research effort of those previous international scientific cooperations had been in the Arctic. The IGY, scheduled for 1957-1958, would focus on the Antarctic, and most of the major nations on Earth were expected to participate.\n\n In January 1955 the U.S. Navy sent the U.S.S. Atka to Antarctica to look for potential base sites. The men of the Atka surveyed the\nRoss Ice Shelf, searched for Highjump's Little America IV camp, then spent time scouting the southern shore of the Weddell Sea and the Dronning Maud Land coast.\nBy December of 1955, preparations for the IGY were well underway. Thirteen ships were en route to Antarctica, bearing personnel\nfor seven separate expeditions. The largest of these was the United States Operation Deepfreeze I, which was responsible for setting up three stations: Little America V, Byrd Station, and the McMurdo Sound Air Operating Facility. (Byrd Station was not actually established until Deepfreeze II, in 1956-57.) The McMurdo Sound facility was to provide air support for the other bases and serve as the logistics center for establishing a base at south pole the following season. As winter 1956 closed in, there were twenty-nine separate parties in Antarctica from seven countries: British, Chilean, and Argentine outposts on the Peninsula, and French, American, Australian, Soviet, and British stations on the continent proper. In all, 508 people were wintering over.\nPreparations continued during the 1956-57 austral summer season. Thirteen more stations were established, bringing the total on\nthe continent to 42, representing 12 countries (Belgium, Norway, New Zealand, Japan, and South Africa had joined the effort). An additional 21 stations were established on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands.\nOn October 31, 1956, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral George Dufek stepped out of an airplane to become the eleventh person in history\nto set foot at the south pole, and the first since Robert Scott's pole party left there in 1912. The U.S. then mounted a massive air operation from the McMurdo Sound air base to transport 760 tons of supplies to the south pole for construction of South Pole Station. The station was complete by March 1957 and occupied for the IGY winter by eighteen men, under the leadership of Dr. Paul Siple. This would be the first time anyone had ever spent the winter at the southernmost point on Earth. (The Soviets had wintered in the interior of the continent the previous year, at Pionerskaya Station, 230 miles inland from Mirny Station.)\nTwo other large projects were undertaken at the same time. The Soviets were setting up two inland bases, one at Vostok near the Geomagnetic Pole and the other, called Sovietskaya, at the Pole of Inaccessibility. Although\nnot as massive as the south pole effort, each required a traverse over unknown territory. The other large project, timed to coincide with the IGY, was the British Commonwealth Trans- Antarctic Expedition. This joint British-New Zealand project, led by Sir Vivian Fuchs and Sir Edmund Hillary, intended to make the first over land crossing of Antarctica. In early 1957, Hillary established Scott Base on Ross Island to serve as a logistics center for the effort.\n\n On November 24, 1957, Fuchs left Shackleton Base at Vahsel Bay in the Weddell Sea and headed south. On January 18, 1958 he\nreached the south pole and was greeted by Hillary, who had traversed south from Ross Island to meet him. They headed north together and on March 2 the two traverse teams rolled successfully into Scott Base.\nBy this time the IGY was well underway. During the summer of 1956-57,42 bases and supporting ships accommodated 6,167\npeople in Antarctica, more than at any other time in history. In 1957-58 there were 44 continental bases, 21 island bases, and 5,362 people involved in the largest multinational scientific research effort in history.\nThe IGY was originally scheduled to last from June 1957 through December 1958. It was so successful, however, that all\nparticipating nations soon formed permanent research programs to continue their presence and activities in Antarctica. The International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), which had proposed the IGY, formed the Special Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) to coordinate the continued scientific cooperation between treaty nations. The success of the effort, and the need to defuse competing territorial claims also led to the signing of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. In essence, this treaty (ratified by all parties in 1961) set the continent of Antarctica aside for peaceful, scientific purposes and placed all territorial claims on hold.\nSince the IGY, scientific research in the Antarctic has continued at a steady pace. Though the number of Antarctic research stations\ndropped to 33 by 1960 and reached a low of 30 in 1964, there has been a slow increase ever since. In 1994 there were 37 active, year-round stations operated by 17 nations. At least five other stations are active during the austral summer, and there are nine stations on sub-Antarctic islands. This level of activity approaches that of the IGY.\nThere is a big difference, though, between the IGY and the present, and that difference is in the number of nations represented.\nEver since the signing of the Antarctic Treaty by the 12 original members, other nations have either signed on as consultative members (those engaging in active research) or accedent members (those without active research but whose government agrees to abide by the treaty). As of 1996, there were 26 consultative nations and 16 accedent nations, for a total of 42 countries involved in Antarctic affairs.\n\n Mirroring the decline in the number of stations following the IGY, both the summer and winter populations dropped. In the summer\nof 1958-1959 there were only 3,887 people in Antarctica. By 1960-1961 the population had dropped slightly, to 3,796. Since then, the number of people in Antarctica has grown steadily. By 1970-1971 the number had risen to 4,411, by 1980-81 to 6,481, and during the 1989-1990 summer season there were 8,340 scientists and support personnel working in Antarctica.\nThe wintering population pattern is slightly different. From a high of 893 in 1958, it dropped to 651 in 1961, grew to 846 by 1972,\nthen dropped again to 743 in 1976. After that the growth was steady. By 1990 the number of people spending the winter in Antarctica had risen to 1,145.\nBesides fostering international cooperation and furthering knowledge about Antarctica, the IGY had the unintended\nconsequence of increasing public awareness and curiosity about the southern continent. As a result, tourism came to Antarctica. The level of tourist activity has fluctuated considerably, however. Chile began tourism flights in 1956 with 74 participants (66 passengers and 8 crew). During the IGY, 414 people paid to be taken to Antarctica by ship, and 47 more flew over it. Shipborne tourist traffic increased to 4,929 in 1974-1975, then dropped to a low of 830 in 1983- 1984. Airplane sightseers increased to 5,051 in 1978-1979, until the Air New Zealand crash on Mount Erebus in 1979 put a halt to overflights from New Zealand and Australia. (There is now talk of resuming them.)\nCruise ship passenger levels have increased more or less steadily since 1986 (when only 995 tourists were carried to Antarctica).\nThe greatest increase has come just in the last few years. While 3,730 tourists visited Antarctica on cruise ships in 1989-1990, during the 1995-1996 summer season there were 113 cruises carrying 9,212 passengers, a nearly 300% increase in traffic in only six years. In all, there are now 21 companies offering tour packages to Antarctica.\nIf tourists are added to scientific and support personnel, nearly 20,000 people went to Antarctica in 1995-1996. Only 54 years ago\nthat number was 75.\nWherever humans go they have an impact on the environment, and Antarctica is no exception. Until recently, our record of\nstewardship has not been good. Within the last few years, though, government agencies\n\n involved in Antarctic research have become increasingly aware of the need to protect that continent's uniquely pristine status. Consequently, formerly polluted bases have been cleaned up, and new protocols have been approved by the Antarctic Treaty nations to limit pollution and other forms of environmental damage. It will never be possible to completely eliminate human impact, though, as long as people continue to travel and work in Antarctica.\nThe impact of human activity on the Antarctic environment can be roughly divided into three broad categories: exploitation, pollution,\nand disturbance.\nTo date, all human exploitation of Antarctica has been for biological resources. This may be due in no small part to the difficulty,\neven impossibility, of mineral and oil extraction in that environment. That situation may change as new technologies develop, though the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty prohibits mining activity until at least the year 2041.\nMost of Antarctica's biological resources are now protected to some degree. That was not the case in the early years of\nhuman activity. Captain Cook's 1775 report of plentiful seals and whales in Antarctic waters brought hunters in great numbers to the southern ocean. The fur trade with China was beginning to open up and there were large amounts of money to be made. British sealers began harvesting at South Georgia as early as 1778. In 1792, American sealers began operations at South Georgia and Kergulen Island.\nHarvesting methods were brutal and efficient, and there was no regard to sustaining the breeding stock. Between 1790 and 1822 over 1,200,000 skins were taken from South Georgia alone, virtually exterminating the seals\nthere. James Weddell noted that more than 100,000 South Shetland fur seal pups died of starvation during 1821-1822, after their mothers were killed and skinned. With a little prudent regulation, those islands might have provided a yearly harvest almost indefinitely. Instead, the population was rendered economically extinct.\nBy 1825, six species of fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella, A. forsteri, A. tropicalis, A. australis, A. phillipii, and A. pusillus) had\nbeen hunted to near extinction around the coasts of Chile and Argentina, and on most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic islands.\nBy the 1870s, after fifty years of being left alone, seal populations had begun to recover slightly. However, a brief resumption of \"scorched earth\" policies decimated them again. By the late nineteenth century, commercial fur\nseal hunting had effectively ended, and it has not been resumed.\n\n The hunting of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) for their oil continued at varying levels up until the early 1960s. At\ntimes when elephant seals were scarce, the sealers would turn to penguins. Throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century, thousands of these birds were killed and rendered for their meager amount of oil. Penguin populations, however, were never decimated to the same degree as seals.\nIn addition to the organized slaughter of seals and penguins for profit, both were occasionally killed for scientific reasons.\nAlso, most early Antarctic expeditions augmented their food supplies with penguin eggs and penguin and seal meat. (The Astrolabe sailors, hungry for fresh meat, compared penguin favorably to chicken. Bellingshausen's men found it to be more palatable after it had been soaked in vinegar for a few days. Adrien de Gerlache considered it inedible.) Fresh meat was considered an effective means of preventing or curing scurvy, a disease which haunted nearly all early explorers.\nOn occasions when an expedition's ship was unexpectedly beset or crushed by pack ice, the crew depended on seal and penguin\nmeat for survival. The men in Nordenskjld's Antarctic expedition killed as many as 2000 penguins for food in 1903. Scott's northern party subsisted almost entirely on penguin and seal meat in 1912. They also depended on seal blubber to keep them warm, as did the men of Shackleton's marooned Ross Sea party in 1916. Because the species exploited for sustenance were usually different than those slaughtered for commercial purposes, the long term effect of these depredations was probably slight.\nBy the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, whales had become the target for exploitation. Whaling technology had\nadvanced enough such that whalers were finally able to hunt the fast-swimming rorquals that populated Antarctic waters in such abundance. Several whaling stations were set up, including ones on South Georgia and Deception Island, and hunting began in earnest. The ocean-going factory ship made its appearance in 1923, accompanied by fast, steam powered catcher boats, and the industry grew rapidly. Species after species was hunted until it became difficult to find, then the hunt was transferred to another animal. After the prized southern right whale, blue and humpback whales were hunted preferentially. Then the hunt shifted to fin whales, then sei whales. Sperm whales were also taken. During the 1937-1938 season, 33 whaling expeditions killed 46,000 whales. Between 1956 and 1965, 631,518 whales were killed.\nUp until 1935, England and Norway was responsible for about 90% of the catch. After 1937, Japan began to dominate the southern\nwhaling industry, with the Soviet Union entering the scene in 1951. By the early-19605, it became clear that whales had been overhunted. Catches per unit effort were declining dramatically (even though 41,000 whales were killed in Antarctic waters during the 1960-61 season). England ceased Antarctic whaling in 1963, and Norway followed suit in 1968. By then,\n\n though, many whale stocks had been reduced to small fractions of their estimated original populations; blue whales to 5%, fin and sei whales to 20%, right and humpback whales to 3%.\nCurrently there is a moratorium on Antarctic factory ship whaling, though a certain level of \"scientific\" whaling is permitted. Japan\ntakes advantage of that loophole to kill about 300 minke whales per year. Nonetheless, the level of exploitation has been reduced to near zero.\nThe effect of the whale slaughter on the Antarctic ecosystem is still under study. Penguins that consume krill are abundant. Fur seals\nthat use the same food source have not only recovered from the brink of extinction, but may in fact be more numerous than before they were hunted. In some areas they are overrunning breeding beaches and degrading the surrounding foliage, which in turn is destroying the breeding habitat of some sea birds. Whales take much longer to reproduce than seals and penguins, and it may be that the absence of these large predators from the ecosystem has provided extra food for their pinniped and avian competitors. This may be slowing the whales' recovery, since they are faced with increased competition for food. The equation is further complicated by human harvesting of krill. It is unknown how long it may take for the Antarctic ecosystem to return to its pre- exploitation equilibrium, if indeed it ever will.\nThe first negative effect visited on Antarctica by human presence was pollution; early expeditions simply tossed all of their garbage\nand sewage overboard. However, the small quantities of these pollutants generated by the expeditions of Kergulen and James Cook had a negligible impact. Later sailing expeditions also discarded their refuse into the environment, but the number of people involved and amount garbage generated was still relatively small.\nIn addition, the garbage discarded or lost to storm damage was natural in origin (foodstuffs, feces, wood, fabric, metal) and so could be expected to degrade at some level (albeit slowly). Natural items in relatively small amounts\nare also unlikely to adversely affect indigenous biology. Even the photochemicals discarded by early photographers like Herbert Ponting and Frank Hurley were biodegradable.\nAt times the level of refuse was higher than others. When a vessel was beset and crushed by the pack ice, such as the Antarctic\nin 1903 and the Endurance in 1915, a comparatively large amount of anthropogenic debris was deposited into the environment. In the early nineteenth century, sealers left large amounts of debris and garbage on numerous Antarctic and sub- Antarctic islands, including building materials, personal goods, food containers, and rusting, metal try pots. Whalers were even more prodigious in the amount of garbage they left behind. Whole whaling stations, like those at Grytviken and Leith Harbor on South Georgia, lie abandoned and crumbling. On the shore, huge oil storage tanks disintegrate into rust and numerous buildings fall into disrepair, while\n\n catcher boats wallow in the harbor. On some islands huge piles of bleached whale bones attest to the former slaughter.\nDespite the prodigious mess in some places, the level of historical pollution is still quite low when measured against the\nvastness of Antarctica.\nThe twentieth century brought three notable changes in Antarctic pollution. First, technology began to produce materials which had\nnever existed in nature. The advent of airplanes, diesel powered vessels, and motorized vehicles meant the introduction of gasoline and other refined fossil fuels to Antarctica. These and other manufactured chemicals have a notably deleterious effect on the environment when they are spilled, as they often were. (The aviation fuel requirement for America's IGY effort alone was over a million gallons, of which 140,000 was spilled into McMurdo Sound in 1956 when a fuel barge was crushed between ice floes.) The wreck of the Bahia Paraiso in 1989 provided a recent and dramatic example of the kinds of damage possible from fuel spills; several breeding bird populations were severely impacted. Also, until recently hazardous chemical wastes (solvents, laboratory chemicals, and the like) were poured directly into the environment, with unknown consequences.\nThe modern era also brought with it other manufactured and synthetic products, like plastics, for which no biological breakdown\nsystem exists. In the cold and dry Antarctic environment, where unpainted wood can last for centuries, these synthetic products can be expected to persist essentially forever. Before they were banned as packing material, styrofoam peanuts were frequently shipped to McMurdo Station, where the persistent winds would blow them across the landscape. If one were to look hard enough, one could probably find bits of styrofoam along the entire length and breadth of the Ross Sea.\nSecond, the level of human activity increased dramatically. The 1946-1947 U.S. Navy Antarctic Developments Project was the\nlargest expedition ever launched. While no records exist, it is reasonable to presume that the quantity of garbage discarded into the environment that summer season was commensurate with the large number of people involved. (Until very recently, all shipboard garbage was tossed into the sea, worldwide.) As human activity in the Antarctic continued to increase, through the IGY and beyond, so too did the amount of trash, sewage, and hazardous chemicals introduced to the environment.\nIn recent years, however, there have been some positive changes. The U.S. Antarctic Program, for instance, no longer dumps or\nburns garbage but removes all waste (except sewage) from the continent. Even better, most of this material is recycled.\n\n Third, a dramatic change in the pattern of garbage dumping and accumulation came with the establishment of permanent\nstations. Until that time, waste was spread out as ships and ground-based expeditions dumped their refuse wherever they happened to be. Minor accumulations, two to four years worth perhaps, built up around the campsites of the heroic era expeditions of Robert Scott, Ernest Shackleton, and others. (Many of these areas are now considered historical monuments, garbage and all.) Once stations became permanently inhabited, waste began to accumulate in one spot over a period of many years. Storms and high winds would spread some of the trash across a wider area, but most of it remained (or remains) localized. Before long many stations began to look like garbage dumps--and many of them still do. The impact of this waste concentration on the immediate environment has not been extensively studied.\nIn some cases, the waste was dumped into the sea, from where it is extremely difficult to remove. For many years the U.S.\nprogram piled unwanted metal waste on the sea ice and waited for it to melt through or be carried away. Piles of debris are now scattered widely on the sea floor of McMurdo Sound and it is unlikely the area will ever be completely cleaned up. Trash was also bulldozed into the sea near McMurdo Station and Scott Base. The sea floor in Winter Quarters Bay, around Hut Point, and at Pram Point on Ross Island is littered with large amounts of debris. It is likely that this pattern has been repeated at other stations around the continent and on the Antarctic and sub- Antarctic islands.\nWhile it is obvious that the slaughter of animals and pollution of the environment clearly constitute a disturbance, the term is used\nhere to refer to activities that do not fall specifically into either of those categories. For instance, the movement of ships through the pack and fast ice will displace (and may sometimes kill) seals and penguins. Helicopters and airplanes flying overhead will also disturb animals on the ice, causing them at times to scramble toward the water. As more and more vessels and aircraft operate in the Antarctic, this level of disturbance will increase.\nConstruction activities have been known to disturb indigenous animal populations. The most egregious example of this was the\nFrench Antarctic Program's construction of a gravel runway at Dumont d'Urville Station, which involved dynamiting parts of a penguin rookery. The runway was subsequently destroyed by a storm and is not operational.\nIn the course of their studies, scientists must often disturb animals and their environment. Researchers often capture and\nrestrain seals and penguins to draw blood samples or attach depth recorders and satellite tracking devices. Long term population studies necessarily disturb the same animal groups for many years, and this may ultimately alter the animals' behavior toward humans. Recent penguin studies that used stomach lavage to study food preferences resulted in breeding failure and\n\n chick mortality. Other scientists have collected fish and invertebrate samples from the water column and sea floor, and these collections constitute a disturbance of the local ecology. How great is the disturbance caused by these activities is not known, but where collections have occurred for many years in the same place, it is conceivable that the local ecology has been altered.\nFinally, the mere presence of human establishments and the constant levels of human activity in a previously unoccupied\nenvironment constitutes a disturbance of that environment. Currently, this type of disturbance is highly localized, occurring primarily at the permanent stations and the frequently visited tourist destinations. Animal behavior, and the growth and distribution patterns of both vertebrates and invertebrates, may be altered. Once again, the level of alteration and its ultimate effects have not been extensively studied and are not well known.\nAntarctica: Great Stories From the Reader's Digest Books, Sydney,\nAntarctic Treaty System: An\nAssessment.

      "text": "Akhenaten (pronounced ), also spelled Echnaton, Akhenaton, (Ancient Egyptian: ꜣḫ-n-jtn ʾŪḫə-nə-yātəy, pronounced , meaning \"Effective for the Aten\"), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh reigning c. 1353–1336 or 1351–1334 BC, the tenth ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Before the fifth year of his reign, he was known as Amenhotep IV (Ancient Egyptian: jmn-ḥtp, meaning \"Amun is satisfied\", Hellenized as Amenophis IV). As a pharaoh, Akhenaten is noted for abandoning Egypt's traditional polytheism and introducing Atenism, or worship centered around Aten. The views of Egyptologists differ as to whether the religious policy was absolutely monotheistic, or whether it was monolatry, syncretistic, or henotheistic. This culture shift away from traditional religion was reversed after his death. Akhenaten's monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name excluded from lists of rulers compiled by later pharaohs. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor Tutankhamun, who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his reign. When some dozen years later, rulers without clear rights of succession from the Eighteenth Dynasty founded a new dynasty, they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors and referred to Akhenaten as \"the enemy\" or \"that criminal\" in archival records.Akhenaten was all but lost to history until the late-19th-century discovery of Amarna, or Akhetaten, the new capital city he built for the worship of Aten. Furthermore, in 1907, a mummy that could be Akhenaten's was unearthed from the tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings by Edward R. Ayrton. Genetic testing has determined that the man buried in KV55 was Tutankhamun's father, but its identification as Akhenaten has since been questioned.Akhenaten's rediscovery and Flinders Petrie's early excavations at Amarna sparked great public interest in the pharaoh and his queen Nefertiti. He has been described as \"enigmatic\", \"mysterious\", \"revolutionary\", \"the greatest idealist of the world\", and \"the first individual in history\", but also as a \"heretic\", \"fanatic\", \"possibly insane\", and \"mad\". Public and scholarly fascination with Akhenaten comes from his connection with Tutankhamun, the unique style and high quality of the pictorial arts he patronized, and the religion he attempted to establish, foreshadowing monotheism. == Family == The future Akhenaten was born Amenhotep, a younger son of pharaoh Amenhotep III and his principal wife Tiye. Akhenaten had an elder brother, crown prince Thutmose, who was recognized as Amenhotep III's heir. Akhenaten also had four or five sisters: Sitamun, Henuttaneb, Iset, Nebetah, and possibly Beketaten. Thutmose's early death, perhaps around Amenhotep III's thirtieth regnal year, meant that Akhenaten was next in line for Egypt's throne.Akhenaten was married to Nefertiti, his Great Royal Wife. The exact timing of their marriage is unknown, but inscriptions from the pharaoh's building projects suggest that they married either shortly before or after Akhenaten took the throne. For example, Egyptologist Dimitri Laboury suggests that the marriage took place in Akhenaten's fourth regnal year. A secondary wife of Akhenaten named Kiya is also known from inscriptions. Some Egyptologists theorize that she gained her importance as the mother of Tutankhamun. William Murnane proposes that Kiya is the colloquial name of the Mitanni princess Tadukhipa, daughter of the Mitanni king Tushratta who had married Amenhotep III before becoming the wife of Akhenaten. Akhenaten's other attested consorts are the daughter of the Enišasi ruler Šatiya and another daughter of the Babylonian king Burna-Buriash II. Akhenaten could have had seven or eight children based on inscriptions. Egyptologists are fairly certain about his six daughters, who are well attested in contemporary depictions. Among his six daughters, Meritaten was born in regnal year one or five; Meketaten in year four or six; Ankhesenpaaten, later queen of Tutankhamun, before year five or eight; Neferneferuaten Tasherit in year eight or nine; Neferneferure in year nine or ten; and Setepenre in year ten or eleven. Tutankhamun, born Tutankhaten, was most likely Akhenaten's son, with Nefertiti or another wife. There is less certainty around Akhenaten's relationship with Smenkhkare, Akhenaten's coregent or successor and husband to his daughter Meritaten; he could have been Akhenaten's eldest son with an unknown wife or Akhenaten's younger brother.Some historians, such as Edward Wente and James Allen, have proposed that Akhenaten took some of his daughters as wives or sexual consorts to father a male heir. While this is debated, some historical parallels exist: Akhenaten's father Amenhotep III married his daughter Sitamun, while Ramesses II married two or more of his daughters, even though their marriages might simply have been ceremonial. In Akhenaten's case, his oldest daughter Meritaten is recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare but is also listed on a box from Tutankhamun's tomb alongside pharaohs Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife. Additionally, letters written to Akhenaten from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as \"mistress of the house.\" Egyptologists in the early 20th century also believed that Akhenaten could have fathered a child with his second oldest daughter Meketaten. Meketaten's death, at perhaps age ten to twelve, is recorded in the royal tombs at Akhetaten from around regnal years thirteen or fourteen. Early Egyptologists attribute her death to childbirth, because of the depiction of an infant in her tomb. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption had been that Akhenaten was the father. Aidan Dodson believes this to be unlikely, as no Egyptian tomb has been found that mentions or alludes to the cause of death of the tomb owner. Further, Jacobus van Dijk proposes that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten's soul. Finally, various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten's daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten. The revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit (\"junior\") and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. According to some, this indicates that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally portraying Kiya's child. == Early life == Egyptologists know very little about Akhenaten's life as prince Amenhotep. Donald B. Redford dates his birth before his father Amenhotep III's 25th regnal year, c. 1363–1361 BC, based on the birth of Akhenaten's first daughter, who was likely born fairly early in his own reign. The only mention of his name, as \"the King's Son Amenhotep,\" was found on a wine docket at Amenhotep III's Malkata palace, where some historians suggested Akhenaten was born. Others contend that he was born at Memphis, where growing up he was influenced by the worship of the sun god Ra practiced at nearby Heliopolis. Redford and James K. Hoffmeier state, however, that Ra's cult was so widespread and established throughout Egypt that Akhenaten could have been influenced by solar worship even if he did not grow up around Heliopolis.Some historians have tried to determine who was Akhenaten's tutor during his youth, and have proposed scribes Heqareshu or Meryre II, the royal tutor Amenemotep, or the vizier Aperel. The only person we know for certain served the prince was Parennefer, whose tomb mentions this fact.Egyptologist Cyril Aldred suggests that prince Amenhotep might have been a High Priest of Ptah in Memphis, although no evidence supporting this had been found. It is known that Amenhotep's brother, crown prince Thutmose, served in this role before he died. If Amenhotep inherited all his brother's roles in preparation for his accession to the throne, he might have become a high priest in Thutmose's stead. Aldred proposes that Akhenaten's unusual artistic inclinations might have been formed during his time serving Ptah, the patron god of craftsmen, whose high priest were sometimes referred to as \"The Greatest of the Directors of Craftsmanship.\" == Reign == === Coregency with Amenhotep III === There is much controversy around whether Amenhotep IV ascended to Egypt's throne on the death of his father Amenhotep III or whether there was a coregency, lasting perhaps as long as 12 years. Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, Peter Dorman, and other scholars argue strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favor of either no coregency or one lasting at most two years. Donald B. Redford, William J. Murnane, Alan Gardiner, and Lawrence Berman contest the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.Most recently, in 2014, archaeologists found both pharaohs' names inscribed on the wall of the Luxor tomb of vizier Amenhotep-Huy. The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities called this \"conclusive evidence\" that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least eight years, based on the dating of the tomb. However, this conclusion has since been called into question by other Egyptologists, according to whom the inscription only means that construction on Amenhotep-Huy's tomb started during Amenhotep III's reign and ended under Akhenaten's, and Amenhotep-Huy thus simply wanted to pay his respects to both rulers. === Early reign as Amenhotep lV === Akhenaten took Egypt's throne as Amenhotep IV, most likely in 1353 or 1351 BC. It is unknown how old Amenhotep IV was when he did this; estimates range from 10 to 23. He was most likely crowned in Thebes, or less likely at Memphis or Armant.The beginning of Amenhotep IV's reign followed established pharaonic traditions. He did not immediately start redirecting worship toward the Aten and distancing himself from other gods. Egyptologist Donald B. Redford believes this implied that Amenhotep IV's eventual religious policies were not conceived of before his reign, and he did not follow a pre-established plan or program. Redford points to three pieces of evidence to support this. First, surviving inscriptions show Amenhotep IV worshipping several different gods, including Atum, Osiris, Anubis, Nekhbet, Hathor, and the Eye of Ra, and texts from this era refer to \"the gods\" and \"every god and every goddess.\" The High Priest of Amun was also still active in the fourth year of Amenhotep IV's reign. Second, even though he later moved his capital from Thebes to Akhetaten, his initial royal titulary honored Thebes—his nomen was \"Amenhotep, god-ruler of Thebes\"—and recognizing its importance, he called the city \"Southern Heliopolis, the first great (seat) of Re (or) the Disc.\" Third, Amenhotep IV did not yet destroy temples to the other gods and he even continued his father's construction projects at Karnak's Precinct of Amun-Re. He decorated the walls of the precinct's Third Pylon with images of himself worshipping Ra-Horakhty, portrayed in the god's traditional form of a falcon-headed man.Artistic depictions continued unchanged early in Amenhotep IV's reign. Tombs built or completed in the first few years after he took the throne, such as those of Kheruef, Ramose, and Parennefer, show the pharaoh in the traditional artistic style. In Ramose's tomb, Amenhotep IV appears on the west wall, seated on a throne, with Ramose appearing before the pharaoh. On the other side of the doorway, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are shown in the window of appearances, with the Aten depicted as the sun disc. In Parennefer's tomb, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are seated on a throne with the sun disc depicted over the pharaoh and his queen.While continuing the worship of other gods, Amenhotep IV's initial building program sought to build new places of worship to the Aten. He ordered the construction of temples or shrines to the Aten in several cities across the country, such as Bubastis, Tell el-Borg, Heliopolis, Memphis, Nekhen, Kawa, and Kerma. He also ordered the construction of a large temple complex dedicated to the Aten at Karnak in Thebes, northeast of the parts of the Karnak complex dedicated to Amun. The Aten temple complex, collectively known as the Per Aten (\"House of the Aten\"), consisted of several temples whose names survive: the Gempaaten (\"The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten\"), the Hwt Benben (\"House or Temple of the Benben\"), the Rud-Menu (\"Enduring of monuments for Aten forever\"), the Teni-Menu (\"Exalted are the monuments of the Aten forever\"), and the Sekhen Aten (\"booth of Aten\").Around regnal year two or three, Amenhotep IV organized a Sed festival. Sed festivals were ritual rejuvenations of an aging pharaoh, which usually took place for the first time around the thirtieth year of a pharaoh's reign and every three or so years thereafter. Egyptologists only speculate as to why Amenhotep IV organized a Sed festival when he was likely still in his early twenties. Some historians see it as evidence for Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV's coregency, and believed that Amenhotep IV's Sed festival coincided with one of his father's celebrations. Others speculate that Amenhotep IV chose to hold his festival three years after his father's death, aiming to proclaim his rule a continuation of his father's reign. Yet others believe that the festival was held to honor the Aten on whose behalf the pharaoh ruled Egypt, or, as Amenhotep III was considered to have become one with the Aten following his death, the Sed festival honored both the pharaoh and the god at the same time. It is also possible that the purpose of the ceremony was to figuratively fill Amenhotep IV with strength before his great enterprise: the introduction of the Aten cult and the founding of the new capital Akhetaten. Regardless of the celebration's aim, Egyptologists believe that during the festivities Amenhotep IV only made offerings to the Aten rather than the many gods and goddesses, as was customary. === Name change === Among the last documents that refer to Akhenaten as Amenhotep IV are two copies of a letter to the pharaoh from Ipy, the high steward of Memphis. These letters, found in Gurob and informing the pharaoh that the royal estates in Memphis are \"in good order\" and the temple of Ptah is \"prosperous and flourishing,\" are dated to regnal year five, day nineteen of the growing season's third month. About a month later, day thirteen of the growing season's fourth month, one of the boundary stela at Akhetaten already had the name Akhenaten carved on it, implying that the pharaoh changed his name between the two inscriptions.Amenhotep IV changed his royal titulary to show his devotion to the Aten. No longer would he be known as Amenhotep IV and be associated with the god Amun, but rather he would completely shift his focus to the Aten. Egyptologists debate the exact meaning of Akhenaten, his new personal name. The word \"akh\" (Ancient Egyptian: ꜣḫ) could have different translations, such as \"satisfied,\" \"effective spirit,\" or \"serviceable to,\" and thus Akhenaten's name could be translated to mean \"Aten is satisfied,\" \"Effective spirit of the Aten,\" or \"Serviceable to the Aten,\" respectively. Gertie Englund and Florence Friedman arrive at the translation \"Effective for the Aten\" by analyzing contemporary texts and inscriptions, in which Akhenaten often described himself as being \"effective for\" the sun disc. Englund and Friedman conclude that the frequency with which Akhenaten used this term likely means that his own name meant \"Effective for the Aten.\"Some historians, such as William F. Albright, Edel Elmar, and Gerhard Fecht, propose that Akhenaten's name is misspelled and mispronounced. These historians believe \"Aten\" should rather be \"Jāti,\" thus rendering the pharaoh's name Akhenjāti or Aḫanjāti (pronounced ), as it could have been pronounced in Ancient Egypt. === Founding Amarna === Around the same time he changed his royal titulary, on the thirteenth day of the growing season's fourth month, Akhenaten decreed that a new capital city be built: Akhetaten (Ancient Egyptian: ꜣḫt-jtn, meaning \"Horizon of the Aten\"), better known today as Amarna. The event Egyptologists know the most about during Akhenaten's life are connected with founding Akhetaten, as several so-called boundary stelae were found around the city to mark its boundary. The pharaoh chose a site about halfway between Thebes, the capital at the time, and Memphis, on the east bank of the Nile, where a wadi and a natural dip in the surrounding cliffs form a silhouette similar to the \"horizon\" hieroglyph. Additionally, the site had previously been uninhabited. According to inscriptions on one boundary stela, the site was appropriate for Aten's city for \"not being the property of a god, nor being the property of a goddess, nor being the property of a ruler, nor being the property of a female ruler, nor being the property of any people able to lay claim to it.\"Historians do not know for certain why Akhenaten established a new capital and left Thebes, the old capital. The boundary stelae detailing Akhetaten's founding is damaged where it likely explained the pharaoh's motives for the move. Surviving parts claim what happened to Akhenaten was \"worse than those that I heard\" previously in his reign and worse than those \"heard by any kings who assumed the White Crown,\" and alludes to \"offensive\" speech against the Aten. Egyptologists believe that Akhenaten could be referring to conflict with the priesthood and followers of Amun, the patron god of Thebes. The great temples of Amun, such as Karnak, were all located in Thebes and the priests there achieved significant power earlier in the Eighteenth Dynasty, especially under Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, thanks to pharaohs offering large amounts of Egypt's growing wealth to the cult of Amun; historians, such as Donald B. Redford, therefore posited that by moving to a new capital, Akhenaten may have been trying to break with Amun's priests and the god. Akhetaten was a planned city with the Great Temple of the Aten, Small Aten Temple, royal residences, records office, and government buildings in the city center. Some of these buildings, such as the Aten temples, were ordered to be built by Akhenaten on the boundary stela decreeing the city's founding.The city was built quickly, thanks to a new construction method that used substantially smaller building blocks than under previous pharaohs. These blocks, called talatats, measured 1⁄2 by 1⁄2 by 1 ancient Egyptian cubits (c. 27 by 27 by 54 cm), and because of the smaller weight and standardized size, using them during constructions was more efficient than using heavy building blocks of varying sizes. By regnal year eight, Akhetaten reached a state where it could be occupied by the royal family. Only his most loyal subjects followed Akhenaten and his family to the new city. While the city continued to be built, in years five through eight, construction work began to stop in Thebes. The Theban Aten temples that had begun were abandoned, and a village of those working on Valley of the Kings tombs was relocated to the workers' village at Akhetaten. However, construction work continued in the rest of the country, as larger cult centers, such as Heliopolis and Memphis, also had temples built for Aten. === International relations === The Amarna letters have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. The letters are a cache of 382 diplomatic texts and literary and educational materials discovered between 1887 and 1979, and named after Amarna, the modern name for Akhenaten's capital Akhetaten. The diplomatic correspondence comprises clay tablet messages between Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun, various subjects through Egyptian military outposts, rulers of vassal states, and the foreign rulers of Babylonia, Assyria, Syria, Canaan, Alashiya, Arzawa, Mitanni, and the Hittites.The Amarna letters portray the international situation in the Eastern Mediterranean that Akhenaten inherited from his predecessors. In the 200 years preceding Akhenaten's reign, following the expulsion of the Hyksos from Lower Egypt at the end of the Second Intermediate Period, the kingdom's influence and military might increased greatly. Egypt's power reached new heights under Thutmose III, who ruled approximately 100 years before Akhenaten and led several successful military campaigns into Nubia and Syria. Egypt's expansion led to confrontation with the Mitanni, but this rivalry ended with the two nations becoming allies. Slowly, however, Egypt's power started to wane. Amenhotep III aimed to maintain the balance of power through marriages—such as his marriage to Tadukhipa, daughter of the Mitanni king Tushratta—and vassal states. Under Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, Egypt was unable or unwilling to oppose the rise of the Hittites around Syria. The pharaohs seemed to eschew military confrontation at a time when the balance of power between Egypt's neighbors and rivals was shifting, and the Hittites, a confrontational state, overtook the Mitanni in influence.Early in his reign, Akhenaten was evidently concerned about the expanding power of the Hittite Empire under Šuppiluliuma I. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in Canaan, particularly in a struggle for power between Labaya of Shechem and Abdi-Heba of Jerusalem, which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching Medjay troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal Rib-Hadda of Byblos—whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of Amurru under Abdi-Ashirta and later Aziru, son of Abdi-Ashirta—despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: \"You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors\" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124. What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire. Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother Ilirabih is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.In a view discounted by the 21st century, several Egyptologists in the late 19th and 20th centuries interpreted the Amarna letters to mean that Akhenaten was a pacifist who neglected foreign policy and Egypt's foreign territories in favor of his internal reforms. For example, Henry Hall believed Akhenaten \"succeeded by his obstinate doctrinaire love of peace in causing far more misery in his world than half a dozen elderly militarists could have done,\" while James Henry Breasted said Akhenaten \"was not fit to cope with a situation demanding an aggressive man of affairs and a skilled military leader.\" Others noted that the Amarna letters counter the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. For instance, Norman de Garis Davies praised Akhenaten's emphasis on diplomacy over war, while James Baikie said that the fact \"that there is no evidence of revolt within the borders of Egypt itself during the whole reign is surely ample proof that there was no such abandonment of his royal duties on the part of Akhenaten as has been assumed.\" Indeed, several letters from Egyptian vassals notified the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions, implying that the pharaoh sent such instructions. The Amarna letters also show that vassal states were told repeatedly to expect the arrival of the Egyptian military on their lands, and provide evidence that these troops were dispatched and arrived at their destination. Dozens of letters detail that Akhenaten—and Amenhotep III—sent Egyptian and Nubian troops, armies, archers, chariots, horses, and ships.Only one military campaign is known for certain under Akhenaten's reign. In his second or twelfth year, Akhenaten ordered his Viceroy of Kush Tuthmose to lead a military expedition to quell a rebellion and raids on settlements on the Nile by Nubian nomadic tribes. The victory was commemorated on two stelae, one discovered at Amada and another at Buhen. Egyptologists differ on the size of the campaign: Wolfgang Helck considered it a small-scale police operation, while Alan Schulman considered it a \"war of major proportions.\"Other Egyptologists suggested that Akhenaten could have waged war in Syria or the Levant, possibly against the Hittites. Cyril Aldred, based on Amarna letters describing Egyptian troop movements, proposed that Akhenaten launched an unsuccessful war around the city of Gezer, while Marc Gabolde argued for an unsuccessful campaign around Kadesh. Either of these could be the campaign referred to on Tutankhamun's Restoration Stela: \"if an army was sent to Djahy to broaden the boundaries of Egypt, no success of their cause came to pass.\" John Coleman Darnell and Colleen Manassa also argued that Akhenaten fought with the Hittites for control of Kadesh, but was unsuccessful; the city was not recaptured until 60–70 years later, under Seti I.Overall, archeological evidence suggests that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of Egyptian vassals in Canaan and Syria, though primarily not through letters such as those found at Amarna but through reports from government officials and agents. Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt's control over the core of its Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful and aggressive Hittite Empire of Šuppiluliuma I, which overtook the Mitanni as the dominant power in the northern part of the region. Only the Egyptian border province of Amurru in Syria around the Orontes River was lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites; ordered by Akhenaten to come to Egypt, Aziru was released after promising to stay loyal to the pharaoh, nonetheless turning to the Hittites soon after his release. === Later years === Egyptologists know little about the last five years of Akhenaten's reign, beginning in c. 1341 or 1339 BC. These years are poorly attested and only a few pieces of contemporary evidence survive; the lack of clarity makes reconstructing the latter part of the pharaoh's reign \"a daunting task\" and a controversial and contested topic of discussion among Egyptologists. Among the newest pieces of evidence is an inscription discovered in 2012 at a limestone quarry in Deir el-Bersha, just north of Akhetaten, from the pharaoh's sixteenth regnal year. The text refers to a building project in Amarna and establishes that Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still a royal couple just a year before Akhenaten's death. The inscription is dated to Year 16, month 3 of Akhet, day 15 of the reign of Akhenaten.Before the 2012 discovery of the Deir el-Bersha inscription, the last known fixed-date event in Akhenaten's reign was a royal reception in regnal year twelve, in which the pharaoh and the royal family received tributes and offerings from allied countries and vassal states at Akhetaten. Inscriptions show tributes from Nubia, the Land of Punt, Syria, the Kingdom of Hattusa, the islands in the Mediterranean Sea, and Libya. Egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson, consider this year twelve celebration to be the zenith of Akhenaten's reign. Thanks to reliefs in the tomb of courtier Meryre II, historians know that the royal family, Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their six daughters, were present at the royal reception in full. However, historians are uncertain about the reasons for the reception. Possibilities include the celebration of the marriage of future pharaoh Ay to Tey, celebration of Akhenaten's twelve years on the throne, the summons of king Aziru of Amurru to Egypt, a military victory at Sumur in the Levant, a successful military campaign in Nubia, Nefertiti's ascendancy to the throne as coregent, or the completion of the new capital city Akhetaten.Following year twelve, Donald B. Redford and other Egyptologists proposed that Egypt was struck by an epidemic, most likely a plague. Contemporary evidence suggests that a plague ravaged through the Middle East around this time, and ambassadors and delegations arriving to Akhenaten's year twelve reception might have brought the disease to Egypt. Alternatively, letters from the Hattians might suggest that the epidemic originated in Egypt and was carried throughout the Middle East by Egyptian prisoners of war. Regardless of its origin, the epidemic might account for several deaths in the royal family that occurred in the last five years of Akhenaten's reign, including those of his daughters Meketaten, Neferneferure, and Setepenre. === Coregency with Smenkhkare or Nefertiti === Akhenaten could have ruled together with Smenkhkare and Nefertiti for several years before his death. Based on depictions and artifacts from the tombs of Meryre II and Tutankhamun, Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten's coregent by regnal year thirteen or fourteen, but died a year or two later. Nefertiti might not have assumed the role of coregent until after year sixteen, when a stela still mentions her as Akhenaten's Great Royal Wife. While Nefertiti's familial relationship with Akhenaten is known, whether Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were related by blood is unclear. Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten's son or brother, as the son of Amenhotep III with Tiye or Sitamun. Archaeological evidence makes it clear, however, that Smenkhkare was married to Meritaten, Akhenaten's eldest daughter. For another, the so-called Coregency Stela, found in a tomb at Akhetaten, might show queen Nefertiti as Akhenaten's coregent, but this is uncertain as the stela was recarved to show the names of Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten. Egyptologist Aidan Dodson proposed that both Smenkhkare and Neferiti were Akhenaten's coregents to ensure the Amarna family's continued rule when Egypt was confronted with an epidemic. Dodson suggested that the two were chosen to rule as Tutankhaten's coregent in case Akhenaten died and Tutankhaten took the throne at a young age, or rule in Tutankhaten's stead if the prince also died in the epidemic. === Death and burial === Akhenaten died after seventeen years of rule and was initially buried in a tomb in the Royal Wadi east of Akhetaten. The order to construct the tomb and to bury the pharaoh there was commemorated on one of the boundary stela delineating the capital's borders: \"Let a tomb be made for me in the eastern mountain . Let my burial be made in it, in the millions of jubilees which the Aten, my father, decreed for me.\" In the years following the burial, Akhenaten's sarcophagus was destroyed and left in the Akhetaten necropolis; reconstructed in the 20th century, it is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo as of 2019. Despite leaving the sarcophagus behind, Akhenaten's mummy was removed from the royal tombs after Tutankhamun abandoned Akhetaten and returned to Thebes. It was most likely moved to tomb KV55 in Valley of the Kings near Thebes. This tomb was later desecrated, likely during the Ramesside period.Whether Smenkhkare also enjoyed a brief independent reign after Akhenaten is unclear. If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole pharaoh, he likely ruled Egypt for less than a year. The next successor was Nefertiti or Meritaten ruling as Neferneferuaten, reigning in Egypt for about two years. She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten, with the country being administered by the vizier and future pharaoh Ay. While Akhenaten—along with Smenkhkare—was most likely reburied in tomb KV55, the identification of the mummy found in that tomb as Akhenaten remains controversial to this day. The mummy has repeatedly been examined since its discovery in 1907. Most recently, Egyptologist Zahi Hawass led a team of researchers to examine the mummy using medical and DNA analysis, with the results published in 2010. In releasing their test results, Hawass's team identified the mummy as the father of Tutankhamun and thus \"most probably\" Akhenaten. However, the study's validity has since been called into question. For instance, the discussion of the study results does not discuss that Tutankhamun's father and the father's siblings would share some genetic markers; if Tutankhamun's father was Akhenaten, the DNA results could indicate that the mummy is a brother of Akhenaten, possibly Smenkhkare. === Legacy === With Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded fell out of favor: at first gradually, and then with decisive finality. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign (c. 1332 BC) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten. Their successors then attempted to erase Akhenaten and his family from the historical record. During the reign of Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the first pharaoh after Akhenaten who was not related to Akhenaten's family, Egyptians started to destroy temples to the Aten and reuse the building blocks in new construction projects, including in temples for the newly restored god Amun. Horemheb's successor continued in this effort. Seti I restored monuments to Amun and had the god's name re-carved on inscriptions where it was removed by Akhenaten. Seti I also ordered that Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay be excised from official lists of pharaohs to make it appear that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. Under the Ramessides, who succeeded Seti I, Akhetaten was gradually destroyed and the building material reused across the country, such as in constructions at Hermopolis. The negative attitudes toward Akhenaten were illustrated by, for example, inscriptions in the tomb of scribe Mose (or Mes), where Akhenaten's reign is referred to as \"the time of the enemy of Akhet-Aten.\"Some Egyptologists, such as Jacobus van Dijk and Jan Assmann, believe that Akhenaten's reign and the Amarna period started a gradual decline in the Egyptian government's power and the pharaoh's standing in Egyptian's society and religious life. Akhenaten's religious reforms subverted the relationship ordinary Egyptians had with their gods and their pharaoh, as well as the role the pharaoh played in the relationship between the people and the gods. Before the Amarna period, the pharaoh was the representative of the gods on Earth, the son of the god Ra, and the living incarnation of the god Horus, and maintained the divine order through rituals and offerings and by sustaining the temples of the gods. Additionally, even though the pharaoh oversaw all religious activity, Egyptians could access their gods through regular public holidays, festivals, and processions. This led to a seemingly close connection between people and the gods, especially the patron deity of their respective towns and cities. Akhenaten, however, banned the worship of gods beside the Aten, including through festivals. He also declared himself to be the only one who could worship the Aten, and required that all religious devotion previously exhibited toward the gods be directed toward himself. After the Amarna period, during the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties—c. 270 years following Akhenaten's death—the relationship between the people, the pharaoh, and the gods did not simply revert to pre-Amarna practices and beliefs. The worship of all gods returned, but the relationship between the gods and the worshipers became more direct and personal, circumventing the pharaoh. Rather than acting through the pharaoh, Egyptians started to believe that the gods intervened directly in their lives, protecting the pious and punishing criminals. The gods replaced the pharaoh as their own representatives on Earth. The god Amun once again became king among all gods. According to van Dijk, \"the king was no longer a god, but god himself had become king. Once Amun had been recognized as the true king, the political power of the earthly rulers could be reduced to a minimum.\" Consequently, the influence and power of the Amun priesthood continued to grow until the Twenty-first Dynasty, c. 1077 BC, by which time the High Priests of Amun effectively became rulers over parts of Egypt.Akhenaten's reforms also had a longer-term impact on Ancient Egyptian language and hastened the spread of the spoken Late Egyptian language in official writings and speeches. Spoken and written Egyptian diverged early on in Egyptian history and stayed different over time. During the Amarna period, however, royal and religious texts and inscriptions, including the boundary stelae at Akhetaten or the Amarna letters, started to regularly include more vernacular linguistic elements, such as the definite article or a new possessive form. Even though they continued to diverge, these changes brought the spoken and written language closer to one another more systematically than under previous pharaohs of the New Kingdom. While Akhenaten's successors attempted to erase his religious, artistic, and even linguistic changes from history, the new linguistic elements remained a more common part of official texts following the Amarna years, starting with the Nineteenth Dynasty. Akhenaten is also recognized as a Prophet in the Druze faith. == Atenism == Egyptians worshipped a sun god under several names, and solar worship had been growing in popularity even before Akhenaten, especially during the Eighteenth Dynasty and the reign of Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father. During the New Kingdom, the pharaoh started to be associated with the sun disc; for example, one inscription called the pharaoh Hatshepsut the \"female Re shining like the Disc,\" while Amenhotep III was described as \"he who rises over every foreign land, Nebmare, the dazzling disc.\" During the Eighteenth Dynasty, a religious hymn to the sun also appeared and became popular among Egyptians. However, Egyptologists question whether there is a causal relationship between the cult of the sun disc before Akhenaten and Akhenaten's religious policies. === Implementation and development === The implementation of Atenism can be traced through gradual changes in the Aten's iconography, and Egyptologist Donald B. Redford divided its development into three stages—earliest, intermediate, and final—in his studies of Akhenaten and Atenism. The earliest stage was associated with a growing number of depictions of the sun disc, though the disc is still seen resting on the head of the falcon-headed sun god Ra-Horakhty, as the god was traditionally represented. The god was only \"unique but not exclusive.\" The intermediate stage was marked by the elevation of the Aten above other gods and the appearance of cartouches around his inscribed name—cartouches traditionally indicating that the enclosed text is a royal name. The final stage had the Aten represented as a sun disc with sunrays like long arms terminating in human hands and the introduction of a new epithet for the god: \"the great living Disc which is in jubilee, lord of heaven and earth.\"In the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV lived at Thebes, the old capital city, and permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue. However, some signs already pointed to the growing importance of the Aten. For example, inscriptions in the Theban tomb of Parennefer from the early rule of Amenhotep IV state that \"one measures the payments to every (other) god with a level measure, but for the Aten one measures so that it overflows,\" indicating a more favorable attitude to the cult of Aten than the other gods. Additionally, near the Temple of Karnak, Amun-Ra's great cult center, Amenhotep IV erected several massive buildings including temples to the Aten. The new Aten temples had no roof and the god was thus worshipped in the sunlight, under the open sky, rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. The Theban buildings were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aten building here were revealed that preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.One of the most important turning points in the early reign of Amenhotep IV is a speech given by the pharaoh at the beginning of his second regnal year. A copy of the speech survives on one of the pylons at the Karnak Temple Complex near Thebes. Speaking to the royal court, scribes or the people, Amenhotep IV said that the gods were ineffective and had ceased their movements, and that their temples had collapsed. The pharaoh contrasted this with the only remaining god, the sun disc Aten, who continued to move and exist forever. Some Egyptologists, such as Donald B. Redford, compared this speech to a proclamation or manifesto, which foreshadowed and explained the pharaoh's later religious reforms centered around the Aten. In his speech, Akhenaten said: The temples of the gods fallen to ruin, their bodies do not endure. Since the time of the ancestors, it is the wise man that knows these things. Behold, I, the king, am speaking so that I might inform you concerning the appearances of the gods. I know their temples, and I am versed in the writings, specficially, the inventory of their primeval bodies. And I have watched as they have ceased their appearances, one after the other. All of them have stopped, except the god who gave birth to himself. And no one knows the mystery of how he performs his tasks. This god goes where he pleases and no one else knows his going. I approach him, the things which he has made. How exalted they are. In Year Five of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt. The pharaoh \"disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods ... and diverted the income from these cults to support the Aten.\" To emphasize his complete allegiance to the Aten, the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten (Ancient Egyptian: ꜣḫ-n-jtn, meaning \"Effective for the Aten\"). Meanwhile, the Aten was becoming a king itself. Artists started to depict him with the trappings of pharaohs, placing his name in cartouches—a rare, but not unique occurrence, as the names of Ra-Horakhty and Amun-Ra had also been found enclosed in cartouches—and wearing a uraeus, a symbol of kingship. The Aten may also have been the subject of Akhenaten's royal Sed festival early in the pharaoh's reign. With Aten becoming a sole deity, Akhenaten started to proclaim himself as the only intermediary between Aten and his people, and the subject of their personal worship and attention—a feature not unheard of in Egyptian history, with Fifth Dynasty pharaohs such as Nyuserre Ini proclaiming to be sole intermediaries between the people and the gods Osiris and Ra. By Year Nine of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed. This emphasized the changes encouraged by the new regime, which included a ban on images, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. All life on Earth depended on the Aten and the visible sunlight. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation. Aten's name was also written differently starting as early as Year Eight or as late as Year Fourteen, according to some historians. From \"Living Re-Horakhty, who rejoices in the horizon in his name Shu-Re who is in Aten,\" the god's name changed to \"Living Re, ruler of the horizon, who rejoices in his name of Re the father who has returned as Aten,\" removing the Aten's connection to Re-Horakhty and Shu, two other solar deities. The Aten thus became an amalgamation that incorporated the attributes and beliefs around Re-Horakhty, universal sun god, and Shu, god of the sky and manifestation of the sunlight. Akhenaten's Atenist beliefs are best distilled in the Great Hymn to the Aten. The hymn was discovered in the tomb of Ay, one of Akhenaten's successors, though Egyptologists believe that it could have been composed by Akhenaten himself. The hymn celebrates the sun and daylight and recounts the dangers that abound when the sun sets. It tells of the Aten as a sole god and the creator of all life, who recreates life every day at sunrise, and on whom everything on Earth depends, including the natural world, people's lives, and even trade and commerce. In one passage, the hymn declares: \"O Sole God beside whom there is none! You made the earth as you wished, you alone.\" The hymn also states that Akhenaten is the only intermediary between the god and Egyptians, and the only one who can understand the Aten: \"You are in my heart, and there is none who knows you except your son.\" === Atenism and other gods === Some debate has focused on the extent to which Akhenaten forced his religious reforms on his people. Certainly, as time drew on, he revised the names of the Aten, and other religious language, to increasingly exclude references to other gods; at some point, also, he embarked on the wide-scale erasure of traditional gods' names, especially those of Amun. Some of his court changed their names to remove them from the patronage of other gods and place them under that of Aten (or Ra, with whom Akhenaten equated the Aten). Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose (\"child of the moon god\", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous Nefertiti Bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called Thutmose (\"child of Thoth\"). An overwhelmingly large number of faience amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the National Museum of Scotland) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.Archaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep. === After Akhenaten === Following Akhenaten's death, Egypt gradually returned to its traditional polytheistic religion, partly because of how closely associated the Aten became with Akhenaten. Atenism likely stayed dominant through the reigns of Akhenaten's immediate successors, Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten, as well as early in the reign of Tutankhaten. For some years the worship of Aten and a resurgent worship of Amun coexisted.Over time, however, Akhenaten's successors, starting with Tutankhaten, took steps to distance themselves from Atenism. Tutankhaten and his wife Ankhesenpaaten dropped the Aten from their names and changed them to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun, respectively. Amun was restored as the supreme deity. Tutankhamun reestablished the temples of the other gods, as the pharaoh propagated on his Restoration Stela: \"He reorganized this land, restoring its customs to those of the time of Re. ... He renewed the gods' mansions and fashioned all their images. ... He raised up their temples and created their statues. ... When he had sought out the gods' precincts which were in ruins in this land, he refounded them just as they had been since the time of the first primeval age.\" Additionally, Tutankhamun's building projects at Thebes and Karnak used talatat's from Akhenaten's buildings, which implies that Tutankhamun might have started to demolish temples dedicated to the Aten. Aten temples continued to be torn down under Ay and Horemheb, Tutankhamun's successors and the last pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Horemheb might also have ordered the demolition of Akhetaten, Akhenaten's capital city. Further underlining the break with Aten worship, Horemheb claimed to have been chosen to rule by the god Horus. Finally, Seti I, the second pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty, ordered the name of Amun to be restored on inscriptions where it had been removed or replaced by Aten. == Artistic depictions == Styles of art that flourished during the reigns of Akhenaten and his immediate successors, known as Amarna art, are markedly different from the traditional art of ancient Egypt. Representations are more realistic, expressionistic, and naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals, plants and people, and convey more action and movement for both non-royal and royal individuals than the traditionally static representations. In traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility.The portrayals of Akhenaten himself greatly differ from the depictions of other pharaohs. Traditionally, the portrayal of pharaohs—and the Egyptian ruling class—was idealized, and they were shown in \"stereotypically 'beautiful' fashion\" as youthful and athletic. However, Akhenaten's portrayals are unconventional and \"unflattering\" with a sagging stomach; broad hips; thin legs; thick thighs; large, \"almost feminine breasts;\" a thin, \"exaggeratedly long face;\" and thick lips.Based on Akhenaten's and his family's unusual artistic representations, including potential depictions of gynecomastia and androgyny, some have argued that the pharaoh and his family have either suffered from aromatase excess syndrome and sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome, or Antley–Bixler syndrome. In 2010, results published from genetic studies on Akhenaten's purported mummy did not find signs of gynecomastia or Antley-Bixler syndrome, although these results have since been questioned.Arguing instead for a symbolic interpretation, Dominic Montserrat in Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt states that \"there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten's physical portrayal... are not to be read literally\". Because the god Aten was referred to as \"the mother and father of all humankind,\" Montserrat and others suggest that Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten. This required \"a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself\", which will \"display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions\". Akhenaten claimed the title \"The Unique One of Re\", and he may have directed his artists to contrast him with the common people through a radical departure from the idealized traditional pharaoh image.Depictions of other members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are also exaggerated, stylized, and overall different from traditional art. Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, the pharaoh's family life is depicted: the royal family is shown mid-action in relaxed, casual, and intimate situations, taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, such as holding hands and kissing. Nefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone, or with her daughters, in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, such as \"smiting the enemy,\" a traditional depiction of male pharaohs. This suggests that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism. == Speculative theories == Akhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much speculation, ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic fringe theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten monolatry, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but the Aten. === Akhenaten and monotheism in Abrahamic religions === The idea that Akhenaten was the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. One of the first to mention this was Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, in his book Moses and Monotheism. Basing his arguments on his belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that Moses had been an Atenist priest who was forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve. Following the publication of his book, the concept entered popular consciousness and serious research.Freud commented on the connection between Adonai, the Egyptian Aten and the Syrian divine name of Adonis as stemming from a common root; in this he was following the argument of Egyptologist Arthur Weigall. Jan Assmann's opinion is that 'Aten' and 'Adonai' are not linguistically related.There are strong similarities between Akhenaten's Great Hymn to the Aten and the Biblical Psalm 104, but there is debate as to relationship implied by this similarity.Others have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, between Jesus Christ and God, particularly interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than a henotheistic one. Donald B. Redford has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. \"After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'.\" James Henry Breasted likened him to Jesus, Arthur Weigall saw him as a failed precursor of Christ and Thomas Mann saw him \"as right on the way and yet not the right one for the way\".Although scholars like Brian Fagan (2015) and Robert Alter (2018) have re-opened the debate, in 1997, Redford concluded: Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development—one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death. === Possible illness === The unconventional portrayals of Akhenaten—different from the traditional athletic norm in the portrayal of pharaohs—have led Egyptologists in the 19th and 20th centuries to suppose that Akhenaten suffered some kind of genetic abnormality. Various illnesses have been put forward, with Frölich's syndrome or Marfan syndrome being mentioned most commonly.Cyril Aldred, following up earlier arguments of Grafton Elliot Smith and James Strachey, suggested that Akhenaten may have suffered from Frölich's syndrome on the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance. However, this is unlikely, because this disorder results in sterility and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. His children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence.Burridge suggested that Akhenaten may have suffered from Marfan syndrome, which, unlike Frölich's, does not result in mental impairment or sterility. Marfan sufferers tend towards tallness, with a long, thin face, elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves, symptoms that appear in some depictions of Akhenaten. Marfan syndrome is a dominant characteristic, which means sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010 proved negative for Marfan syndrome.By the early 21st century, most Egyptologists argued that Akhenaten's portrayals are not the results of a genetic or medical condition, but rather should be interpreted as stylized portrayals influenced by Atenism. Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten. == Cultural depictions == Akhenaten's life, accomplishments, and legacy have been preserved and depicted in many ways, and he has figured in works of both high and popular culture since his rediscovery in the 19th century AD. Akhenaten—alongside Cleopatra and Alexander the Great—is among the most often popularized and fictionalized ancient historical figures.On page, Amarna novels most often take one of two forms. They are either a Bildungsroman, focusing on Akhenaten's psychological and moral growth as it relates to establishing Atenism and Akhetaten, as well as his struggles against the Theban Amun cult. Alternatively, his literary depictions focus on the aftermath of his reign and religion. A dividing line also exists between depictions of Akhenaten from before the 1920s and since, when more and more archeological discoveries started to provide artists with material evidence about his life and times. Thus, before the 1920s, Akhenaten had appeared as \"a ghost, a spectral figure\" in art, while since he has become realistic, \"material and tangible.\" Examples of the former include the romance novels In the Tombs of the Kings (1910) by Lilian Bagnall—the first appearance by Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti in fiction—and A Wife Out of Egypt (1913) and There Was a King in Egypt (1918) by Norma Lorimer. Examples of the latter include Akhnaton King of Egypt (1924) by Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Joseph and His Brothers (1933–1943) by Thomas Mann, Akhnaton (1973) by Agatha Christie, and Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth (1985) by Naguib Mahfouz. Akhenaten also appears in The Egyptian (1945) by Mika Waltari, which was adapted into the movie The Egyptian (1953). In this movie, Akhenaten, portrayed by Michael Wilding, appears to represent Jesus Christ and his followers proto-Christians.A sexualized image of Akhenaten, building on early Western interest in the pharaoh's androgynous depictions, perceived potential homosexuality, and identification with Oedipal storytelling, also influenced works of art characterized as camp. The two most notable portrayals are Akenaten (1975), an unfilmed screenplay by Derek Jarman, and Akhnaten (1984), an opera by Philip Glass. Both were influenced by the unproven and scientifically unsupported theories of Immanuel Velikovsky, who equated Oedipus with Akhenaten.In the 21st century, Akhenaten appeared as an antagonist in comic books and video games. For example, he is the major antagonist in limited comic-book series Marvel: The End (2003). In this series, Akhenaten is abducted by an alien order in the 14th century BC and reappears on modern Earth seeking to restore his kingdom. He is opposed by essentially all of the other superheroes and supervillains in the Marvel comic book universe and is eventually defeated by Thanos. Additionally, Akhenaten appears as the enemy in the Assassin's Creed Origins The Curse of the Pharaohs downloadable content (2017), and must be defeated to remove his curse on Thebes. His afterlife takes the form of 'Aten', a location that draws heavily on the architecture of the city of Amarna.American death metal band Nile depicted Akhenaten's judgement, punishment, and erasure from history at the hands of the pantheon that he replaced with Aten, in the song Cast Down the Heretic, from their 2005 album Annihilation of the Wicked. == Ancestry == == See also == Pharaoh of the Exodus Osarseph == Notes and references == === Notes === === Bibliography === === Further reading === Aldred, Cyril (1973).

The events covered by this journal are the discovery of the tomb stairway (November 4th 1922), the uncovering of the first sealed doorway (November 5th 1922), Carter's captivating account of peering into the Antechamber of Tutankhamun's tomb for the first time (November 26th 1922), and the death of Carter's patron Lord Carnarvon (April 5th 1923). \nThe journal is housed within its original black ring-binder, stamped \"Walker's Loose-Leaf Book, Cover Number 138\" on the inside front cover, it measures 33 by 21.5 by 1 cm. and contains 148 loose-leaf, graph-lined pages.

I began\nby continuing the former excavation where it had stopped at\nthe N.E. corner of the entrance to the tomb of Ramses VI,\ntrenching southwards. At this point there were ancient\nstone huts of the Necropolis workmen, built rather less\nthan a metre above the bed-rock, which had partly been\nexposed in our former work x (see plan L.M. 15 and 16). As\nwe uncovered them they were found to continue under the\nand in front of the entrance of Ramses VI tomb in a southerly\ndirection and connected up with other similar huts on the\nopposite side of the valley bed discovered by Davis during\nprevious work. These ancient huts were soon cleared of\nthe rubbish covering them. I planned them, and removed\nthem for investigation below, which undertaking took until\nthe fourth of Nov.\nNote x \nThese huts were\nbuilt upon the\nnatural detritus,\nand were covered by \n4 Nov. \nAt about 10am I discovered beneath almost the first hut\nattacked the first traces of the entrance of the tomb (Tût.ankh.\nAmen) This comprised the first step of the N.E. corner\n(of the sunken-staircase). Quite a short time sufficed\nto show that it was the beginning of a steep excavation cut\nin the bed rock, about four metres below the entrance of Ramses\nVI's tomb, and a similar depth below the natural Present\nleve level of the valley. And, that it was of the nature of a\nsunken staircase entrance to a tomb of the type of the XVIIIth\nDyn., but further than that nothing could be told until\nthe heavy rubbish at the foot above was cleared away. \n5 Nov. \nIt took the whole of the preceding day and most of this day\nto free this excavation before the upper margins of the\nstaircase could be demarcated on its four sides. As first\nconjectured it proved to be an opening (about 4 ms x 1.60 ms)\nexcavated in the bed-rock, with its W. side end abutting against\nthe rock slope of the small hillock in which Ramses VI\nhad excavated his tomb. As the work proceeded we found that\nthe western end of the cutting receded under the slope of the\nrock, and thus was partly roofed over by the overhanging rock. \nTowards sunset we had cleared down to the level of the 12th\nstep, which was sufficient to expose a large part of the upper\nportion of a plastered and sealed doorway. Here before us\nwas sufficient evidence to show that it really was an entrance\nto a tomb, and by the seals, to all outward appearances that\nit was intact. \nI examined this exposed portion of the sealed doorway and\nnoticed that the only decipherable impressions of the seals were those\nof the well-known Royal Necropolis seal, i.e., Anubis (symbolizing\na king) over nine foes. \nWith the evidence of these seals, and the fact that the workmen's\nhuts, which in all probabilities dated from the time of the construction\nof Rameses VI's tomb, were built over the mouth of the entrance of\nthis newly discovered tomb without apparently disturbing it, it was\nclear that its content would be undisturbed at least since\nthe XXth Dyn. \nThe seal-impressions suggested that it belonged to somebody of\nhigh standing but at that time I had not found any\nindications as to whom. \nI noticed at the top of the doorway, where some of the cement-\nlike plaster had fallen away, a heavy wooden lintel. To\nassure myself of the method in which the doorway was blocked,\nI made a small hole under this wooden lintel - the R. hand\ncorner, about 35 x 15 cms in size. By this hole I was\nable to perceive with the aid of an electrical torch that the a\npassage beyond was completely filled with stones and rubble\nup to its ceiling, which was again evidence of something that\nhad required careful closing. It was a thrilling moment\nfor an excavator, quite alone save his native staff of workmen,\nto suddenly find himself, after so many years of toilsome work,\non the verge of what looked like a magnificent discovery -\nan untouched tomb. With certain reluctance I reclosed the\nsmall hole that I had made, and returned to another careful\nsearch among the seals to see if I could not find some indication\nthat would point to the identity of the owner, but it was of no\navail for the small space bared by my excavation did not\nexpose any impression sufficiently clear to be made out, other\nthan that of the Royal Necropolis seal already mentioned. \nThough I was satisfied that I was on the verge of perhaps\na magnificent find, probably one of the missing tombs that\nI had been seeking for many years, I was much puzzled\nby the smallness of the opening in comparison with those\nof other royal tombs in the valley. Its design was certainly\nof the XVIIIth Dyn. Could it be the tomb of a noble, buried\nthere by royal consent? Or was it a royal cache? As\nfar as my investigations had gone there was absolutely nothing\nto tell me. Had I known that by digging a few inches deeper I\nwould have exposed seal impressions showing Tût.ankh.Amen's\ninsignia distinctly I should would have fervently worked on and set\nmy mind at rest, but as it was, it was getting late, the night\nhad fast set in, the full moon had risen high in the eastern\nheavens, I refilled the excavation for protection, and with my men\nselected for the occasion - they like myself delighted beyond all\nexpectation - I returned home and cabled to Ld. C. (then in England) the\nfollowing message:- \n\"At last have made wonderful discovery in Valley a\nmagnificent tomb with seals intact recovered same for\nyour arrival congratulations\" \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.25) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.25)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.25) \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.27) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 27 (TAA i.2.1.27)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 27 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.27) \n6 Nov. \nThe men worked feverishly today covering and making safe the\ndiscovery until the time came for fully re-opening. On the top\nof which great stones, that formed the sides of the ancient huts, were rolled. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (TAA i.2.1.29) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (TAA i.2.1.29)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.29) \n7 Nov. \nThe news of the discovery spread fast all over the country, and\nand inquisitive enquiries mingled with congratulations from this\nmoment became the daily programme. \nWe continued clearing the bed-rock of the valley towards the\nsouth where many more huts were exposed and on turning the\ncorner towards the west we opened up, at a higher?higher level than the\nhuts a sort of stone enclosure for mortar - these like the others\nwere evidently part of the camp for Ramses VI tomb. This\ninvestigation continued until the end of the working week - Monday,\nthe 13th Nov. Here, as I found in most other cases, the excavations\nof former explorers, in this case Davis, had only skimmed the\ntop surface and had not even laid bare the huts of the ancient\nworkmen. \n8 Nov. \nReceived wireless from Lord C. \"… possibly come soon …\"\nA little later another wire from Ld. C. \"propose arrive Alexandria\ntwentieth …\" \n9 Nov. \nWired for Callender. \n10 Nov. \nCallender arrived.\nDuring the interim to following date made various preparations\nfor opening the tomb. \n18 Nov. \nLeft for Cairo. \n20 Nov. \nLord C. and Lady E. arrived Cairo.\nMade various purchases in Cairo. \n21 Nov. \nArrived Returned to Luxor \n22 Nov. \nArrived Luxor-Gurna\nLd C. left Cairo for Luxor. \n23 Nov. \nLord C. arrived Luxor, came over to Gurna and put up\nat my house. \nCallender re-started uncovering tomb. \n24 Nov. \nLady E. arrived. \nCallender reached as far as the first doorway. There proved\nto be sixteen steps. \nNow that the whole of the sealed doorway was\nlaid bare various seal impressions bearing the cartouche of\nIn-line image from the manuscript of Tût-ankh-Amen were discernible, more in particular\nin the lower portion of the plastering of the doorway where the\nimpressions were clearest. \nIn the upper part of this sealed doorway traces of two distinct\nre-openings and successive re-closings disclosed were apparent,\nand that the sealed seal-impressions first noticed, Nov. 5, of\nthe Royal Necropolis - i.e., 'Anubis over Nine Foes', had been\nused for the re-closing . Here was evidence of at least the\nreign of the discov tomb, but its true significance was still a\npuzzle, for in the lower rubbish that filled the stair-case\nentrance we found masses of broken potsherds, broken boxes,\nthe latter bearing the names and protocol of Akhenaten, Smenkh-\nKa-Ra, and Tut-ankh-Amen, and with what was even more\nupsetting a scarab of Tehutimes III, as well as a fragment\nbearing the cartouche of Amenhetep III. These conflicting data\nled us for a time to believe that we were about to open a\nroyal cache of the El Amarna branch of the XVIIIth Dyn. Monarchs,\nand that {the} from the evidence mentioned above it had been\nprobably opened and used more than once. \nEngelbach, the Chief Inspector Antiquities Dept., came and witnessed\nthe freeing of rubbish from the first doorway. With him came several\nof his friends, among others Brunton. \nSlept the night in the valley. Carpenters commenced upon making\na temporary wooden grill for fixing over first doorway. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (TAA i.2.1.31) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (TAA i.2.1.31)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.31) \n25 Nov. \nNoted seals. Made photographic records, which were not,\nas they afterwards proved, very successful. Opened the\nfirst doorway; which comprised rough stones built up from the\nthreshold to the lintel, plastered over on the outside face, and\ncovered with numerous impressions from various seals of Tut-ankh-\nAmen and the Royal Necropolis seal. The removal of this\nblocking exposed the commencement of a completely blocked\ndescending passage, the same width as the entrance staircase\nand rather more than 2 metres high. It was filled with its\nlocal stone and rubble, probably from its own excavation, but\nlike the doorway it showed distinct traces of more than one filling;\nthe mass of the filling being of clean white stone chips mingled with\ndust, while in the upper left hand corner a large irregular\nhole had been pierced through it which had been refilled with\ndark flint and chert stones. This coincided with reopenings and\nsuccessive re-closings found on the sealed doorway. \nAs we cleared the passage we found mixed with the rubble\nbroken potsherds, jar seals, and numerous fragments of small\nobjects; water skins lying on the floor together with alabaster jars,\nwhole and broken, and coloured pottery vases; all pertaining to some\ndisturbed burial, but telling us nothing to whom they belonged\nfurther than by their type which was of the late XVIIIth Dyn.\nThese were disturbing elements as they pointed towards plundering. \n26 Nov. \nAfter clearing 9 metres of the descending passage, in about\nthe middle of the afternoon, we came upon a second sealed\ndoorway, which was almost the exact replica of the first. It\nbore similar seal impressions and had similar traces of\nsuccessive re-openings and re-closings in the plastering.\nThe seal impressions were of Tût-ankh-Amen and of the Royal\nNecropolis, but not in any way so clear as those on the\nfirst doorway. The entrance and passage both in plan and in\nstyle resembled almost to measurement the tomb containing\nthe cache of Akhenaten discovered by Davis in the very near\nvicinity; which seemed to substantiate our first conjecture\nthat we had found a cache. \nFeverishly we cleared away the remaining last scraps\nof rubbish on the floor of the passage before the doorway, until\nwe had only the clean sealed doorway before us. In which,\nafter making preliminary notes, we made a tiny breach in the top\nleft hand corner to see what was beyond. Darkness and the iron testing\nrod told us that there was empty space. Perhaps another descending\nstaircase, in accordance to the ordinary royal Theban tomb plan?\nOr may be a chamber? Candles were procured - the all\nimportant Tell-Tale for foul gases when opening when opening\nan ancient subterranean excavation - I widened the breach\nand by means of the candle looked in, while Ld. C., Lady E,\nand Callender with the Reises waited in anxious expectation. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (TAA i.2.1.33) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (TAA i.2.1.33)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.33) \nIt was sometime before one could see, the hot air escaping\ncaused the candle to flicker, but as soon as one's eyes became\naccustomed to the glimmer of light the interior of the chamber\ngradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful\nmedley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one\nanother. There was naturally short suspense for those\npresent who could not see, when Lord Carnarvon said to\nme 'Can you see anything'. I replied to him Yes, it\nis wonderful. I then with precaution made the hole\nsufficiently large for both of us to see. With the light of an\nelectric torch as well as an additional candle we looked\nin. Our sensations and astonishment are difficult to\ndescribe as the better light revealed to us the marvellous\ncollection of treasures: two strange ebony-black effigies\nof a King, gold sandalled, bearing staff and mace, loomed\nout from the cloak of darkness; gilded couches in strange\nforms, lion-headed, Hathor-headed, and beast infernal;\nexquisitely painted, inlaid, and ornamental caskets;\nflowers; alabaster vases, some beautifully executed of lotus\nand papyrus device; strange black shrines with a gilded\nmonster snake appearing from within; quite ordinary looking white\nchests; finely carved chairs; a golden inlaid throne;\na heap of large curious white oviform boxes; beneath\nour very eyes, on the threshold, a lovely lotiform wishing\n-cup in translucent alabaster; stools of all shapes\nand design, of both common and rare materials; and,\nlastly a confusion of overturned parts of chariots glinting with\ngold, peering from amongst which was a mannikin.\nthe furniture The first im\nimpression of which suggested the property-room of an\nopera-house of a vanished civilization. Our sensations were bewildering and full\nof strange emotion. We questioned one another as to the\nmeaning of it all. Was it a tomb or merely a cache?\nA sealed-doorway between the two sentinel statues proved\nthere was more beyond, and with the numerous cartouches\nbearing the name of Tut-ankh-Amen on most of the\nobjects before us, there was little doubt that there behind\nwas the grave of that Pharaoh. \nWe closed the hole, locked the wooden-grill which\nhad been placed upon the first doorway, we mounted\nour donkeys and return home contemplating what we\nhad seen. \nAdvised the Chief Inspector of the Antiquities Department,\nwho was with us at the commencement of the opening of the\nfirst doorway, and asked him to come as soon as possible,\npreferably the following afternoon to enable us to prepare an\nelectrical installation for careful inspection of this extraordinary\nand pleasing discovery. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (TAA i.2.1.33) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (TAA i.2.1.35)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.35) \n27 Nov. \nCallender prepared the electrical installation for lighting the\ntomb. This was ready by noon, when Lord C., Lady E., Callender\nand self entered and made a careful inspection of this first\nchamber (afterwards called the Ante-chamber). \nIn the course of the afternoon the local Inspector, Ibrahîm\nEffendi, of the Department of Antiquities at Luxor, came in the\nplace of the Chief Inspector - he being absent on a visit to\nKena. \nIt soon became obvious that we were but on the threshold\nof the discovery. The sight that met us was beyond anything\none could conceive. This heterogeneous mass of material\ncrowded into the chamber without particular order, so crowded\nthat you were obliged to move with anxious caution, for time\nhad wrought certain havoc with many of the objects, was\nvery bewildering. Everywhere we found traces of disorder caused\nby some early intruder, objects over-turned, broken fragments\nlying upon the floor, all added to the confusion, and the\nunfamiliar plan of tomb repeatedly caused us to ask ourselves\nin our perplexity whether it was really a tomb or a Royal\nCache? As the better light fell upon the objects we endeavoured\nto take them in. It was impossible. They were so many. Beneath\none of the couches, the Thoueris couch in the S.W. corner, we\nperceived an aperture in the rock-wall which proved to be\nnothing less than another sealed-doorway broken open as by\nsome predatory hand. With care Ld. C. and I crept under\nthis strange gilded couch, and we peered into the opening. There\nwe saw that it led into yet another chamber (afterwards\ncalled the Annexe) of smaller dimensions than the Ante-chamber\nand of a lower level. Even greater confusion prevailed here, the\nvery stones that blocked the entrance, forced in when the breach\nwas made, were lying helter-skelter upon the objects on the floor\ncrushed by their weight. It was full of one mass of furniture.\nAn utter confusion of beds, chairs, boxes, alabaster and faience\nvases, statuettes, cases of peculiar form, and every sort of thing\noverturned and searched for valuables. The remaining portions\nof the plaster covering the blocking of this doorway bore similar\nseal-impressions as on the other doorways. \nIn neither of these two chambers could we see any traces\nof a mummy or mummies - the one pious reason for making\na cache. With such evidence, as well as the sealed doorway\nbetween the two guardian statues of the King, the mystery\ngradually dawned upon us. We were but in the anterior portion\nof a tomb. Behind that closed doorway was the tomb-chamber,\nand that Tût-ankh-Amen probably lay there in all his magnificent\npanoply of death - we had found that monarch's burial place\nintact save certain metal-robbing, and not his cache. \nWe then examined the plaster and seal-impressions upon the\nclosed doorway. They were of many types of seals, all bearing the\ninsignia of the King. We also discovered that in the bottom part\nof the blocking a small breach had once been made, large\nenough to allow of a small man to pass through, but it had been\ncarefully reclosed, plastered and sealed. Evidently the tomb beyond\nhad been entered - by Thieves! Who knows? But sufficient\nevidence to tell that someone had made ingress. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (TAA i.2.1.37) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (TAA i.2.1.37)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.35) \nThe results of our investigations were, (1) it was clear the place\nwas Pharaoh's tomb and not a mere cache; (2) that we had only\nentered the anterior chambers of the tomb, filled with magnificent\nequipment equal only to the wealth and splendour of the New Empire;\n(3) that we had found a royal burial little disturbed save\nhurried plundering at the hands of ancient tomb robbers. \nIt was a sight surpassing all precedent, and one we\nnever dreamed of seeing. We were astonished by the beauty\nand refinement of the art displayed by the objects surpassing\nall we could have imagined - the impression was overwhelming. \n28 Nov. \nMost of this day was spent in preparing for an official opening\nof the tomb to take place on the morrow - the 29th. Engelbach, the\nChief Inspector, returned from Kena by the midday train, came over\nto the Valley on his motor-cycle in the afternoon and inspected\nthe discovery. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (TAA i.2.1.39) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (TAA i.2.1.39)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.39) \n29 Nov. \nToday we had a sort of official opening to which the following\nguests were invited: Lady Allenby and AdC; H.E. Abdel Aziz Bey Yehia,\nthe Mudir of Kena; the Maamur of Luxor; Mr and Mrs Maudsley; Mr and Mrs K. Boyde;\nMr and Mrs de Garis Davies; Mr and Mrs Engelbach; Lady Downes and daughter;\nAbdel Razik Bey of the Mus. Of Agriculture; Mr and Mrs Merton of the Times; Mr and Mrs Brunton;\nThe Irrigation Insp. Of Kena district; Wise Bey of the Police; the Commandant of the Kena\nPolice; Ibreheem Effendi, Insp. Of Luxor; and others. Lunch was given 12.30 at\nthe head of the valley - near tomb No. 15, when afterwards Lady Allenby and H.E.\nthe Mudir of Kena with Ld. C. and self opened the tomb. A special report\nto The Times was sent to Luxor by special runner - about 3pm. \n30 Nov. \nA number of Egyptian notables of Luxor came early in the\nmorning and requested to be allowed to see the interior of the tomb.\nWe were totally unprepared for such a large quantity of visitors,\nand in view of the preservation of the antiquities they being very\ncrowded and in poor preservation, we were obliged to refuse\nadmission until some preparation was made to safeguard the\nobjects. \nLacau and Tottenham, who were unable to be present\nat the official opening yesterday, arrived today, about 11am,\nand made their official inspection. Both were very pleased\nand I might say astonished at the discovery - Lacau particularly\nso and very enthusiastic. They remained to lunch and\ntalked over various matters in connection with the find. Tottenham\nspoke very appreciatively of our achievement, and went so far\nto say that he would endeavour to see that Ld C. should be fully\nrecompensed for his good work and enterprise, and that he\nthought it the duty of the Eg.

I began\nby continuing the former excavation where it had stopped at\nthe N.E. corner of the entrance to the tomb of Ramses VI,\ntrenching southwards. At this point there were ancient\nstone huts of the Necropolis workmen, built rather less\nthan a metre above the bed-rock, which had partly been\nexposed in our former work x (see plan L.M. 15 and 16). As\nwe uncovered them they were found to continue under the\nand in front of the entrance of Ramses VI tomb in a southerly\ndirection and connected up with other similar huts on the\nopposite side of the valley bed discovered by Davis during\nprevious work. These ancient huts were soon cleared of\nthe rubbish covering them. I planned them, and removed\nthem for investigation below, which undertaking took until\nthe fourth of Nov.\nNote x \nThese huts were\nbuilt upon the\nnatural detritus,\nand were covered by \n4 Nov. \nAt about 10am I discovered beneath almost the first hut\nattacked the first traces of the entrance of the tomb (Tût.ankh.\nAmen) This comprised the first step of the N.E. corner\n(of the sunken-staircase). Quite a short time sufficed\nto show that it was the beginning of a steep excavation cut\nin the bed rock, about four metres below the entrance of Ramses\nVI's tomb, and a similar depth below the natural Present\nleve level of the valley. And, that it was of the nature of a\nsunken staircase entrance to a tomb of the type of the XVIIIth\nDyn., but further than that nothing could be told until\nthe heavy rubbish at the foot above was cleared away. \n5 Nov. \nIt took the whole of the preceding day and most of this day\nto free this excavation before the upper margins of the\nstaircase could be demarcated on its four sides. As first\nconjectured it proved to be an opening (about 4 ms x 1.60 ms)\nexcavated in the bed-rock, with its W. side end abutting against\nthe rock slope of the small hillock in which Ramses VI\nhad excavated his tomb. As the work proceeded we found that\nthe western end of the cutting receded under the slope of the\nrock, and thus was partly roofed over by the overhanging rock. \nTowards sunset we had cleared down to the level of the 12th\nstep, which was sufficient to expose a large part of the upper\nportion of a plastered and sealed doorway. Here before us\nwas sufficient evidence to show that it really was an entrance\nto a tomb, and by the seals, to all outward appearances that\nit was intact. \nI examined this exposed portion of the sealed doorway and\nnoticed that the only decipherable impressions of the seals were those\nof the well-known Royal Necropolis seal, i.e., Anubis (symbolizing\na king) over nine foes. \nWith the evidence of these seals, and the fact that the workmen's\nhuts, which in all probabilities dated from the time of the construction\nof Rameses VI's tomb, were built over the mouth of the entrance of\nthis newly discovered tomb without apparently disturbing it, it was\nclear that its content would be undisturbed at least since\nthe XXth Dyn. \nThe seal-impressions suggested that it belonged to somebody of\nhigh standing but at that time I had not found any\nindications as to whom. \nI noticed at the top of the doorway, where some of the cement-\nlike plaster had fallen away, a heavy wooden lintel. To\nassure myself of the method in which the doorway was blocked,\nI made a small hole under this wooden lintel - the R. hand\ncorner, about 35 x 15 cms in size. By this hole I was\nable to perceive with the aid of an electrical torch that the a\npassage beyond was completely filled with stones and rubble\nup to its ceiling, which was again evidence of something that\nhad required careful closing. It was a thrilling moment\nfor an excavator, quite alone save his native staff of workmen,\nto suddenly find himself, after so many years of toilsome work,\non the verge of what looked like a magnificent discovery -\nan untouched tomb. With certain reluctance I reclosed the\nsmall hole that I had made, and returned to another careful\nsearch among the seals to see if I could not find some indication\nthat would point to the identity of the owner, but it was of no\navail for the small space bared by my excavation did not\nexpose any impression sufficiently clear to be made out, other\nthan that of the Royal Necropolis seal already mentioned. \nThough I was satisfied that I was on the verge of perhaps\na magnificent find, probably one of the missing tombs that\nI had been seeking for many years, I was much puzzled\nby the smallness of the opening in comparison with those\nof other royal tombs in the valley. Its design was certainly\nof the XVIIIth Dyn. Could it be the tomb of a noble, buried\nthere by royal consent? Or was it a royal cache? As\nfar as my investigations had gone there was absolutely nothing\nto tell me. Had I known that by digging a few inches deeper I\nwould have exposed seal impressions showing Tût.ankh.Amen's\ninsignia distinctly I should would have fervently worked on and set\nmy mind at rest, but as it was, it was getting late, the night\nhad fast set in, the full moon had risen high in the eastern\nheavens, I refilled the excavation for protection, and with my men\nselected for the occasion - they like myself delighted beyond all\nexpectation - I returned home and cabled to Ld. C. (then in England) the\nfollowing message:- \n\"At last have made wonderful discovery in Valley a\nmagnificent tomb with seals intact recovered same for\nyour arrival congratulations\" \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.25) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.25)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.25) \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 25 (TAA i.2.1.27) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 27 (TAA i.2.1.27)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 27 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.27) \n6 Nov. \nThe men worked feverishly today covering and making safe the\ndiscovery until the time came for fully re-opening. On the top\nof which great stones, that formed the sides of the ancient huts, were rolled. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (TAA i.2.1.29) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (TAA i.2.1.29)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 29 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.29) \n7 Nov. \nThe news of the discovery spread fast all over the country, and\nand inquisitive enquiries mingled with congratulations from this\nmoment became the daily programme. \nWe continued clearing the bed-rock of the valley towards the\nsouth where many more huts were exposed and on turning the\ncorner towards the west we opened up, at a higher?higher level than the\nhuts a sort of stone enclosure for mortar - these like the others\nwere evidently part of the camp for Ramses VI tomb. This\ninvestigation continued until the end of the working week - Monday,\nthe 13th Nov. Here, as I found in most other cases, the excavations\nof former explorers, in this case Davis, had only skimmed the\ntop surface and had not even laid bare the huts of the ancient\nworkmen. \n8 Nov. \nReceived wireless from Lord C. \"… possibly come soon …\"\nA little later another wire from Ld. C. \"propose arrive Alexandria\ntwentieth …\" \n9 Nov. \nWired for Callender. \n10 Nov. \nCallender arrived.\nDuring the interim to following date made various preparations\nfor opening the tomb. \n18 Nov. \nLeft for Cairo. \n20 Nov. \nLord C. and Lady E. arrived Cairo.\nMade various purchases in Cairo. \n21 Nov. \nArrived Returned to Luxor \n22 Nov. \nArrived Luxor-Gurna\nLd C. left Cairo for Luxor. \n23 Nov. \nLord C. arrived Luxor, came over to Gurna and put up\nat my house. \nCallender re-started uncovering tomb. \n24 Nov. \nLady E. arrived. \nCallender reached as far as the first doorway. There proved\nto be sixteen steps. \nNow that the whole of the sealed doorway was\nlaid bare various seal impressions bearing the cartouche of\nIn-line image from the manuscript of Tût-ankh-Amen were discernible, more in particular\nin the lower portion of the plastering of the doorway where the\nimpressions were clearest. \nIn the upper part of this sealed doorway traces of two distinct\nre-openings and successive re-closings disclosed were apparent,\nand that the sealed seal-impressions first noticed, Nov. 5, of\nthe Royal Necropolis - i.e., 'Anubis over Nine Foes', had been\nused for the re-closing . Here was evidence of at least the\nreign of the discov tomb, but its true significance was still a\npuzzle, for in the lower rubbish that filled the stair-case\nentrance we found masses of broken potsherds, broken boxes,\nthe latter bearing the names and protocol of Akhenaten, Smenkh-\nKa-Ra, and Tut-ankh-Amen, and with what was even more\nupsetting a scarab of Tehutimes III, as well as a fragment\nbearing the cartouche of Amenhetep III. These conflicting data\nled us for a time to believe that we were about to open a\nroyal cache of the El Amarna branch of the XVIIIth Dyn. Monarchs,\nand that {the} from the evidence mentioned above it had been\nprobably opened and used more than once. \nEngelbach, the Chief Inspector Antiquities Dept., came and witnessed\nthe freeing of rubbish from the first doorway. With him came several\nof his friends, among others Brunton. \nSlept the night in the valley. Carpenters commenced upon making\na temporary wooden grill for fixing over first doorway. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (TAA i.2.1.31) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (TAA i.2.1.31)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 31 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.31) \n25 Nov. \nNoted seals. Made photographic records, which were not,\nas they afterwards proved, very successful. Opened the\nfirst doorway; which comprised rough stones built up from the\nthreshold to the lintel, plastered over on the outside face, and\ncovered with numerous impressions from various seals of Tut-ankh-\nAmen and the Royal Necropolis seal. The removal of this\nblocking exposed the commencement of a completely blocked\ndescending passage, the same width as the entrance staircase\nand rather more than 2 metres high. It was filled with its\nlocal stone and rubble, probably from its own excavation, but\nlike the doorway it showed distinct traces of more than one filling;\nthe mass of the filling being of clean white stone chips mingled with\ndust, while in the upper left hand corner a large irregular\nhole had been pierced through it which had been refilled with\ndark flint and chert stones. This coincided with reopenings and\nsuccessive re-closings found on the sealed doorway. \nAs we cleared the passage we found mixed with the rubble\nbroken potsherds, jar seals, and numerous fragments of small\nobjects; water skins lying on the floor together with alabaster jars,\nwhole and broken, and coloured pottery vases; all pertaining to some\ndisturbed burial, but telling us nothing to whom they belonged\nfurther than by their type which was of the late XVIIIth Dyn.\nThese were disturbing elements as they pointed towards plundering. \n26 Nov. \nAfter clearing 9 metres of the descending passage, in about\nthe middle of the afternoon, we came upon a second sealed\ndoorway, which was almost the exact replica of the first. It\nbore similar seal impressions and had similar traces of\nsuccessive re-openings and re-closings in the plastering.\nThe seal impressions were of Tût-ankh-Amen and of the Royal\nNecropolis, but not in any way so clear as those on the\nfirst doorway. The entrance and passage both in plan and in\nstyle resembled almost to measurement the tomb containing\nthe cache of Akhenaten discovered by Davis in the very near\nvicinity; which seemed to substantiate our first conjecture\nthat we had found a cache. \nFeverishly we cleared away the remaining last scraps\nof rubbish on the floor of the passage before the doorway, until\nwe had only the clean sealed doorway before us. In which,\nafter making preliminary notes, we made a tiny breach in the top\nleft hand corner to see what was beyond. Darkness and the iron testing\nrod told us that there was empty space. Perhaps another descending\nstaircase, in accordance to the ordinary royal Theban tomb plan?\nOr may be a chamber? Candles were procured - the all\nimportant Tell-Tale for foul gases when opening when opening\nan ancient subterranean excavation - I widened the breach\nand by means of the candle looked in, while Ld. C., Lady E,\nand Callender with the Reises waited in anxious expectation. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (TAA i.2.1.33) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (TAA i.2.1.33)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 33 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.33) \nIt was sometime before one could see, the hot air escaping\ncaused the candle to flicker, but as soon as one's eyes became\naccustomed to the glimmer of light the interior of the chamber\ngradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful\nmedley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one\nanother. There was naturally short suspense for those\npresent who could not see, when Lord Carnarvon said to\nme 'Can you see anything'. I replied to him Yes, it\nis wonderful. I then with precaution made the hole\nsufficiently large for both of us to see. With the light of an\nelectric torch as well as an additional candle we looked\nin. Our sensations and astonishment are difficult to\ndescribe as the better light revealed to us the marvellous\ncollection of treasures: two strange ebony-black effigies\nof a King, gold sandalled, bearing staff and mace, loomed\nout from the cloak of darkness; gilded couches in strange\nforms, lion-headed, Hathor-headed, and beast infernal;\nexquisitely painted, inlaid, and ornamental caskets;\nflowers; alabaster vases, some beautifully executed of lotus\nand papyrus device; strange black shrines with a gilded\nmonster snake appearing from within; quite ordinary looking white\nchests; finely carved chairs; a golden inlaid throne;\na heap of large curious white oviform boxes; beneath\nour very eyes, on the threshold, a lovely lotiform wishing\n-cup in translucent alabaster; stools of all shapes\nand design, of both common and rare materials; and,\nlastly a confusion of overturned parts of chariots glinting with\ngold, peering from amongst which was a mannikin.\nthe furniture The first im\nimpression of which suggested the property-room of an\nopera-house of a vanished civilization. Our sensations were bewildering and full\nof strange emotion. We questioned one another as to the\nmeaning of it all. Was it a tomb or merely a cache?\nA sealed-doorway between the two sentinel statues proved\nthere was more beyond, and with the numerous cartouches\nbearing the name of Tut-ankh-Amen on most of the\nobjects before us, there was little doubt that there behind\nwas the grave of that Pharaoh. \nWe closed the hole, locked the wooden-grill which\nhad been placed upon the first doorway, we mounted\nour donkeys and return home contemplating what we\nhad seen. \nAdvised the Chief Inspector of the Antiquities Department,\nwho was with us at the commencement of the opening of the\nfirst doorway, and asked him to come as soon as possible,\npreferably the following afternoon to enable us to prepare an\nelectrical installation for careful inspection of this extraordinary\nand pleasing discovery. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (TAA i.2.1.33) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (TAA i.2.1.35)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 35 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.35) \n27 Nov. \nCallender prepared the electrical installation for lighting the\ntomb. This was ready by noon, when Lord C., Lady E., Callender\nand self entered and made a careful inspection of this first\nchamber (afterwards called the Ante-chamber). \nIn the course of the afternoon the local Inspector, Ibrahîm\nEffendi, of the Department of Antiquities at Luxor, came in the\nplace of the Chief Inspector - he being absent on a visit to\nKena. \nIt soon became obvious that we were but on the threshold\nof the discovery. The sight that met us was beyond anything\none could conceive. This heterogeneous mass of material\ncrowded into the chamber without particular order, so crowded\nthat you were obliged to move with anxious caution, for time\nhad wrought certain havoc with many of the objects, was\nvery bewildering. Everywhere we found traces of disorder caused\nby some early intruder, objects over-turned, broken fragments\nlying upon the floor, all added to the confusion, and the\nunfamiliar plan of tomb repeatedly caused us to ask ourselves\nin our perplexity whether it was really a tomb or a Royal\nCache? As the better light fell upon the objects we endeavoured\nto take them in. It was impossible. They were so many. Beneath\none of the couches, the Thoueris couch in the S.W. corner, we\nperceived an aperture in the rock-wall which proved to be\nnothing less than another sealed-doorway broken open as by\nsome predatory hand. With care Ld. C. and I crept under\nthis strange gilded couch, and we peered into the opening. There\nwe saw that it led into yet another chamber (afterwards\ncalled the Annexe) of smaller dimensions than the Ante-chamber\nand of a lower level. Even greater confusion prevailed here, the\nvery stones that blocked the entrance, forced in when the breach\nwas made, were lying helter-skelter upon the objects on the floor\ncrushed by their weight. It was full of one mass of furniture.\nAn utter confusion of beds, chairs, boxes, alabaster and faience\nvases, statuettes, cases of peculiar form, and every sort of thing\noverturned and searched for valuables. The remaining portions\nof the plaster covering the blocking of this doorway bore similar\nseal-impressions as on the other doorways. \nIn neither of these two chambers could we see any traces\nof a mummy or mummies - the one pious reason for making\na cache. With such evidence, as well as the sealed doorway\nbetween the two guardian statues of the King, the mystery\ngradually dawned upon us. We were but in the anterior portion\nof a tomb. Behind that closed doorway was the tomb-chamber,\nand that Tût-ankh-Amen probably lay there in all his magnificent\npanoply of death - we had found that monarch's burial place\nintact save certain metal-robbing, and not his cache. \nWe then examined the plaster and seal-impressions upon the\nclosed doorway. They were of many types of seals, all bearing the\ninsignia of the King. We also discovered that in the bottom part\nof the blocking a small breach had once been made, large\nenough to allow of a small man to pass through, but it had been\ncarefully reclosed, plastered and sealed. Evidently the tomb beyond\nhad been entered - by Thieves! Who knows? But sufficient\nevidence to tell that someone had made ingress. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (TAA i.2.1.37) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (TAA i.2.1.37)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 37 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.35) \nThe results of our investigations were, (1) it was clear the place\nwas Pharaoh's tomb and not a mere cache; (2) that we had only\nentered the anterior chambers of the tomb, filled with magnificent\nequipment equal only to the wealth and splendour of the New Empire;\n(3) that we had found a royal burial little disturbed save\nhurried plundering at the hands of ancient tomb robbers. \nIt was a sight surpassing all precedent, and one we\nnever dreamed of seeing. We were astonished by the beauty\nand refinement of the art displayed by the objects surpassing\nall we could have imagined - the impression was overwhelming. \n28 Nov. \nMost of this day was spent in preparing for an official opening\nof the tomb to take place on the morrow - the 29th. Engelbach, the\nChief Inspector, returned from Kena by the midday train, came over\nto the Valley on his motor-cycle in the afternoon and inspected\nthe discovery. \nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (TAA i.2.1.39) Howard Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (TAA i.2.1.39)\nHoward Carter's Journal for 1922, p. 39 (© Griffith Institute, TAA i.2.1.39) \n29 Nov. \nToday we had a sort of official opening to which the following\nguests were invited: Lady Allenby and AdC; H.E.

A special report\nto The Times was sent to Luxor by special runner - about 3pm. \n30 Nov. \nA number of Egyptian notables of Luxor came early in the\nmorning and requested to be allowed to see the interior of the tomb.\nWe were totally unprepared for such a large quantity of visitors,\nand in view of the preservation of the antiquities they being very\ncrowded and in poor preservation, we were obliged to refuse\nadmission until some preparation was made to safeguard the\nobjects. \nLacau and Tottenham, who were unable to be present\nat the official opening yesterday, arrived today, about 11am,\nand made their official inspection. Both were very pleased\nand I might say astonished at the discovery - Lacau particularly\nso and very enthusiastic. They remained to lunch and\ntalked over various matters in connection with the find. Tottenham\nspoke very appreciatively of our achievement, and went so far\nto say that he would endeavour to see that Ld C. should be fully\nrecompensed for his good work and enterprise, and that he\nthought it the duty of the Eg.

      "text": "Biography\nEarly life\n\nMace was born on 17 July 1874 in Glenorchy, near Hobart in Tasmania, to Reverend John Cruttenden Mace and Mary Ellen (née Bromby). With his father abroad, much of youth was spent with clergy relatives in East London. He attended St Edward's School, Oxford, and Keble College, Oxford, taking his degree in 1895. His family had close ties with the high church Oxford Movement, and the Church was seen as his likely career. He decided instead to work for his cousin Flinders Petrie, a prominent Egyptologist and pioneer of systematic excavations.\nAfter leaving Oxford, Mace joined Flinders Petrie in Egypt, beginning his archaeological career with the Egypt Exploration Fund, digging at Dendera 1897–98, Hiw 1898–99 and Abydos 1899–1901. From 1901 he worked with George Reisner who was excavating at Giza and Naga el-Deir, before studying at the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1902–03 and then returning to Egypt. In 1906 Mace joined the Metropolitan Museum of Art team at Lisht, northern Egypt, and in 1909 was appointed assistant curator of the Museum in New York, where he helped arrange the Museum's Egyptian Department. Moving back to Egypt in 1912, he worked on the Amenemhat pyramid and the tomb of Senebtisi at Lisht.\n\nIn 1915 Mace returned to England, enlisting in the Artists’ Rifles Regiment. In February 1917 he was commissioned in the Army Service Corps as a 2nd Lieutenant, serving in the UK and in Genoa, Italy.\n\nAfter leaving the Army in 1919, Mace went to New York to work on the restoration of Ancient Egyptian artifacts for the Metropolitan Museum, before returning to lead the excavations at Lisht in 1920. He was still working there when, in December 1922, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to loan him to the archaeologist Howard Carter to support the clearance of Tutankhamun's tomb.\nTomb of Tutankhamun\n\nIn November 1922 Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, its contents largely intact. Given the size and scope of the task in cataloguing and clearing the tomb, Carter sought help from Albert Lythgoe of the Metropolitan Museum's Egyptian excavation team, who readily agreed to the loan of a number of his staff, including Mace.\n\nArriving on 25 December 1922, Mace was a part of a small team of experienced archaeologists and experts, led by Carter and including Alfred Lucas, Arthur Callender and photographer Harry Burton.\n\nMace had become an expert in the preservation of fragile materials, and his principal role, together with Alfred Lucas, was to treat each of the objects found, some of them quite fragile, including cleaning and preliminary repairs before shipment to the Cairo Museum. To undertake this work, they established a makeshift laboratory in the empty tomb of Seti II located close to Tutankhamen's tomb. Conditions in the tomb were cramped and extremely hot, with Mace and Lucas working long hours to keep pace with the items removed from Tutankhamun's tomb.\n\nIn addition to his conservation work, Mace gave the excavation broader support. He was one of Carter's closer companions and confidants, co-writing with Carter the first volume of the popular account of the excavation, The tomb of Tut Ankh Amen. When required he assisted in the work within Tutankhamun's tomb, including helping Carter remove the shroud from Tutankhamen's body. He also played an important role in reporting and advising during Carter's legal dispute with the Egyptian authorities, that led to the temporary closure of the tomb in 1924.\n\nDue to the heat, work was undertaken each winter. Mace worked on the clearance for two winter seasons, before leaving both Carter's team, and Egypt, for health reasons in the spring of 1924.\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1907 Mace married Winifred Blyth, they had two daughters, Margaret and Anne. During the Tutankhamun excavation they lived with Mace near the site, Winifred arriving with her grand piano strapped on the back of a camel.\n\nDuring his final years in Egypt, Mace had suffered from pleurisy, which led to pneumonia. He was unable to continue his Egyptological work, and left the excavation team in 1924. Spending the next four winters in England and the French Riviera, Mace died on 6 April 1928 at a nursing home in Haywards Heath, Sussex. Winifred and her daughter Margaret kept in touch with Howard Carter, visiting him in his Kensington flat during the 1930s. In 1937 Margaret married organist and composer Robin Orr. ",

      "text": "Alfred Lucas OBE (27 August 1867 – 9 December 1945) was an Egyptian-based English analytical chemist and archaeologist. He is best known for being part of Howard Carter's team at the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb, analysing and conserving many of the finds, but he was also a pioneer in the wider fields of artifact preservation and forensic science. \n\nEarly life\n\nLucas was born in Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Manchester, England, to commercial travelers Joshua Peter Lucas and Sarah (née Thomas). He studied chemistry in London at the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science, before working for eight years as an assistant chemist at the Government Laboratory in London.[1]\nCareer in Egypt\n\nDiagnosed with tuberculosis in 1897, Lucas moved to Egypt a year later where he made a complete recovery.[2] Serving as a chemist with the Egyptian civil service, he worked in Egypt for the rest of his career. After starting in the Salt Department,[1] he was employed in a series of chemical laboratory posts, including with the Geological Survey Department, which introduced him to Egypt's ancient monuments,[2] Chief Chemist of the Surveys Department[3] and then Director and Principal Chemist of the Government Analytical Laboratory.[4] In 1923 he planned to retire to pursue his interest in archaeology. He however accepted the position of Consulting Chemist to the Antiquities Service, and later of honorary consulting chemist, which he held until his death in 1945.[1][5]\n\nLucas also undertook much forensic science work, developing considerable expertise as a ballistics and handwriting expert. He often gave expert evidence in court, and advised British court-martials on forensic matters during both world wars. His writings on forensic science were well received and considered ground-breaking,[5] with the English language Egyptian Gazette referring to him as \"Egypt's Sherlock Holmes\".[6]\nThe tomb of Tutankhamun\n\nDuring his time in Egypt, Lucas developed an expertise in the analysis and preservation of objects recovered from excavated ancient Egyptian sites.[1] When in November 1922 the archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun with its contents largely intact, the Egyptian authorities agreed to loan Lucas to the excavation.[7] He commenced work in December 1922,[8] a part of a small team of experienced archaeologists and experts, led by Howard Carter and including Arthur Mace, Arthur Callender and photographer Harry Burton.[9] Lucas played a key role in this team, being responsible for the conservation, restoration and preparation for shipping of the thousands of objects found, some of them quite fragile.[1] To enable him to undertake this work, a makeshift laboratory was set up in the nearby empty tomb of Seti II,[10] with Lucas, assisted by Arthur Mace, assessing, cleaning and – if necessary – repairing each object to ensure safe transport to the Cairo Museum.[11]\n\nLucas's descriptions of the conservation process were published in several newspapers, including a 1923 article in The Times, where he described the difficulties encountered when preserving objects from the tomb:\n\n    Many of the objects are in such a condition that before they are photographed, recorded, packed, or transported to Cairo they must be cleaned, strengthened and repaired. Any error in treatment might ruin them. ... The first thing to do is to remove superficial dust, which may usually be done by means of a small pair of bellows or by gentle brushing with an artist's small, soft, dry bristle. A duster cannot be used, as this might catch in any loose gold and cause damage.\n\n    ... The nature and properties of all these materials must be analysed. ... What is the best cementing material for refastening loose gold or loose inlay, since a material employed by the Ancient Egyptians in the dry climate of Upper Egypt is not necessarily suitable for the damper climate of museums?\n\n    Very little chemical work has been done on many of the problems faced, and of that little a considerable proportion of the results are so scattered in scientific journals that they cannot easily be traced.[12]\n\nGiven the heat of the tomb, work was undertaken over the winter, with Lucas spending much of the remainder of his time in Cairo performing chemical analysis and preparing objects for exhibition.[5] Working closely with Howard Carter, Lucas proved to be one of the excavation's most committed supporters,[13] finally spending nine seasons until 1930 working in his on-site laboratory.[14]\nLater years and achievements\n\nAfter his involvement with Tutankhamun's tomb, Lucas supported a number of other excavations,[7] including serving on a commission to consider the restoration of the neglected Theban tombs.[5]\n\nDuring the Second World War, he helped in the work to safeguard the objects in the Cairo Museum,[1] and gave lectures and published information booklets for British forces in Egypt.[5] He died, aged 78, at Luxor Hospital on 9 December 1945, during a visit to Luxor, having suffered heart failure.[15] A bachelor, the bulk of his estate was left to his brother and sister and their children.[5]\n\nLucas published numerous books, papers and articles on his research findings, including subjects relating to the Egypt of his time and the preservation of ancient Egyptian materials, drawing on his work in Tutankhamen's tomb. His books on both artifact conservation and forensic chemistry proved influential and helped develop these fields as professions, some remaining in print many years after his death.[5]\n\nLucas received a number of honours for his service with the Egyptian government, including the Ottoman Order of Osmanieh fourth class in 1906,[3] appointment as an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1920[4] and the Egyptian Order of the Nile third class in 1921.[16]\n",

Rocco Petrone, who became the Marshall director in 1973, said that Webb felt the group \n\nneeded to be more tightly controlled. \n\nOn January 4 th , 1945, U.S. General George S. Patton wrote a remarkable thing in his war diary: “We can still lose this war.” It \nwas a remarkable statement, especially since the last large German offensive of World War Two, the Battle of the Bulge, was all but \nfinished, and the victorious Allied armies, like their Soviet counterparts in the East, were then poised to deal the final death blows to \nHitler’s crumbling Third Reich. Optimism prevailed at the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). For some \nreason, however, General “Blood and Guts” Patton, despite his well known public image of bravado and optimism, had serious \nprivate fears and reservations. The question is: \n\nWhy? \n\nWhy indeed, since on any conventional military appraisal, the German Reich was finished. It was only a matter of... time. \n\nBut even with the ill-fated German Ardennes offensive - the Battle of the Bulge - there is more than meets the eye when one adds \nin the thesis of my previous book, Reich of the Black Sun, that the Nazis may have won the race for the atom bomb well ahead of the \nManhattan Project. The objective of the German offensive was, according to the standard explanation, to break through thinly held \nAmerican lines in the Ardennes, drive behind the Allied lines in Holland, seize the port of Antwerp, and thus not only drive a wedge \nbetween American and British forces, but also to cut the supply lines to British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Faw Montgomery’s \narmies in the Netherlands. But the standard explanation fails simply for the reason that the Allies would have been capable of using \nDutch ports to supply the “trapped” armies. Thus, the end of the war presents, behind the “obvious” and “well known ‘facets,’” yet \nanother mystery. What really was the Nazi leadership trying to do, and why would it have caused such concern to General Patton to \ncause him to remark about it in his diary? British author Geoffrey Brooks pinpoints the hidden military and political reasoning that \nlay behind the Nazi offensive by raising precisely this question: \n\nHitler’s Fuftwaffe ADC von Below remarked in his 1982 memoirs that even he could not understand why Hitler wanted to go \nto Antwerp - “a place that led nowhere.”- \n\nBut the answer may lie in a curious order placed in German shipyards in the period leading up to the surprise German offensive, for \nan order for twenty-four “500-ton submersible barges able to transport and launch V-2 rockets” was placed at yards in Stettin and \nElbing.- And Fondon was just within range of the V-2 from Antwerp. \n\nB ut the mystery does not yet end, for an offensive merely to resume the V-2 bombardment of England does not yet make sense. \nAccording to Brooks, one only begins to see the logic behind the German offensive by seeing it connected to a resumption of V-2 \nattacks, for “the V-2 campaign had been a failure. Hitler knew that. There had to be something extra to make all this worthwhile.”- \nWhat that “something extra” was, was hinted at by none other than the Deputy Commanding General for the US Army Air Force’s \nIntelligence, Fieutenant General Donal Putt, shortly after the war in 1946. Brooks’ comments are worth citing extensively: \n\n(Ft. General Putt) told the Society of Aeronautical Engineers: “The Germans were preparing rocket surprises for the whole \nworld in general and England in particular which would have, it is believed, changed the course of the war if the invasion had \nbeen postponed for so short a time as half a year.” Putt was also quoted in an aside as having stated that “the Germans had V-2s \nwith atomic explosive warheads.” A surprise is a surprise and hitherto ordinary rocket warfare had proved unproductive. The \n\n\nrange of the V-2 was 200 miles. The crucial success of the Allied progress by December 1944 had therefore been to drive the \nGerman forces in Europe beyond this limit. The objective of the Ardennes campaign was the Belgian port of Antwerp, 200 \nmiles from London .- \n\nIn other words, once again, the Nazi atom bomb is the hidden logic at work in the operational plans of both sides late in the war, and \nis very likely the hidden operational logic behind the otherwise militarily indefensible German offensive in the Ardennes. Small \nwonder then, that Patton would remark “We can still lose this war,” even at such a late date. Similarly, if this scenario is the basis of \nhis remarks, then it also serves to indicate that America’s most celebrated field commander was also privy to some very sensitive \ninformation. \n\nAs was seen in my previous book, Reich of the Black Sun, a number of articles appeared in the post-war Western press to \ncorroborate the notion that the war was won, not against a tottering Reich, but just in the nick of time. The articles usually \naccompanied these evaluations with revelations of Nazi secret weapons, most of them on the “fantastic” end of the spectrum. \nPerhaps this was a ploy to convince the Western public that the Nazi leaders were quite insane - as if any convincing needed to be \ndone by that point - and that their hopes were so wildly bizarre and unrealistic that indeed the Third Reich’s military state in late \n1944 and early 1945 was all but hopeless. \n\n\nA. “We Can Still Lose This War” \n\n\nB ut psychological operations or not, even the American aerospace firm Convair (Consolidated Vultee) got in on the act, with a \ntwo page advertisement in Life magazine in its August 27, 1945 edition with an “article” entitled “...by the Skin of our Teeth.” \n\nSEVERAL TIMES during the European phase of this war, victory was almost within Germany’s grasp...on land, on \nthe sea, or in the air. \n\nAbove all, knowing the vital importance of air supremacy, the Nazis tried time and again to wrest it back from the Allies. \n\nAnd they almost succeeded. \n\n\nTime Ran Out \n\nEspecially in the last months of the war, our margin of safety was slimmer than most of us suspected. \n\nJust how slim it was is known best to certain American military experts who have since inspected some of Germany’s \nunderground research laboratories and war plants. \n\nHere they saw secret weapons in various stages of development.. . weapons which might conceivably have turned the \ntrick for the Nazis if they could have used them boldly in a last desperate gamble. \n\nSome of these things can be revealed. Others cannot - vet. \n\nIn one plant, the U.S. Army officers found partially assembled jet fighter planes of radical new design. There were planes \npotentially better than anything the Allies had in combat at that time. \n\nIF time hadn’t run out on the Germans, quantities of these jet planes might have changed the balance of air power in \ntheir favor. \n\nIn a V rocket plant, burrowed 800 feet deep in limestone rock, our technicians found blueprints for a fearful V bomb with an \nestimated range of 3000 miles. \n\n“We planned to destroy New York and other American cities starting in November,” said a German rocket engineer. \n\nTarget: U.S.A. \n\nIn a converted salt mine, our ordnance officers examined nearly completed jet-propelled heavy bombers... bombers claimed \nby the Germans to be capable of crashing high explosives into the industrial cities of the eastern United States and \nflying back again across the Atlantic. \n\nGoering himself said the planes had been successfully test-flown and would have been in operation if Germany could have \nheld out three months longer. \n\nBut those catastrophes, and others, never quite came to pass on the German timetable of war. We managed, right to the \nend, to maintain the air supremacy we had achieved...sometimes just by the skin of our teeth !- \n\n\nConsolidated Vultee Article \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n...by the Skin of ourTeeth \n\n\nI \n\n\n\nConsolidated Vultee Article \n\n\n\nCONSOUMTEDMTEJE AIRCRAFT CORPORATION \n\n\n\nThis disquieting state of affairs suggests that there was more to German rocketry at the end of the war than merely lobbing short- \nranged V-ls and V-2s on London and other western European cities. Indeed, if blueprints for a rocket with a 3,000 mile range were \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfound in an underground factory at the end of the war, this strongly suggests that the rumored intercontinental Amerikaraket was \nnearing production, and that implies that some long range prototype may have already been tested. \n\nMoreover, this “we won in the nick of time” attitude is corroborated by two very unlikely sources. Project Mercury and Gemini \nastronaut Gorden Cooper revealed that at the war’s end America was only one week from catastrophe.- But even more sensational \ncorroboration of General Patton’s gloomy assessment comes from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt himself. After receiving \ninformation via Turkey that the Germans were working on a “V-3” that could strike the east coast of the U.S., President Roosevelt \nrevealed in a letter to his cousin Daisy on December 6, 1944, the real reason for his concern: not the rocket itself, but the fact that the \nGermans possessed ”a weapon named V-3, that could destroy anything within a circumference of a kilometer with a single blow.\" \nThe dating here is significant, for it would place Roosevelt’s letter after both the German fuel-air bomb tests and, more importantly, \nafter the alleged a-bomb test on the island of Riigen ca. Oct 10-11, 1944.— \n\nPresident Roosevelt and General Patton were not the only senior Allied officials to express private reservations about the future \ncourse of the war at that late date. Indeed, behind the Allied superiority in all conventional arms, there lurked a disquieting fact, a fact \nmade clear by the following secret memorandum: \n\n\nSECRET \n\nHEADQUARTERS \n\nUNITED STATES STRATEGIC AIR FORCES IN EUROPE (REAR) \nOffice of the Director of Intelligence \n\n\nAAF Sta 390 \nAPO 633, U.S. Army \n5 January 1945 \n\nMEMORANDUM: \n\nTo: Brigadier General George C. McDonald, D. of I., Hq., USSTAF. \n\n1. You will recollect that the SHAEF forecast, arrived at after D-day in 1944, placed the capitulation of Germany at the \nend of December of that year. It is believed that this SHAEF forecast strongly influenced the planning in Washington \nand in this theater. Predicated upon this date, questions of type U.S. Air Force equipment, weapons, tactics, training and \nsupplies were decided. \n\n2. Hitler’s Germany did not place the termination date of this war at the end of 1944. Hitler’s Germany has indicated with \ndetermination and virility that it expects this war to continue for a long and indefinite period of time, and that it is \nstruggling to gain supremacy in weapons as well as generalship. \n\n3. With the exception of a few modifications and improvements in the U.S. Air Forces in this theater are fighting with \nsubstantially the same weapons as they used in 1942. From 1942 through 1944 the aircraft and equipment of the U.S. \nArmy Air Forces were superior in practically every detail to anything the enemy had in this theater. Indeed, weapons \nand equipment in general, whether belonging to the Ground Troops or to the Air, enjoyed for the U.S. superiority \nduring this first period. This period ended December 31, 1944 with Germany still fighting, but Germany is not fighting \nwith the weapons of 1942. She is leading the world in tested jet propelled airplanes, long range missiles, new type \nsubmarines and, in certain classes, better tanks. A large part of her manufacturing facilities have gone underground and \nshe is bending every sinew for the last stand on the Vaterland frontiers. \n\n4. Our Ground Armies, despite superiority in manpower and quantity of equipment, are presently engaged more in \ndefensive than offensive fighting and, unless this state of affairs is quickly changed or the Russians actually drive \nthrough to Berlin and victory, we must face the grim expectation of fighting Germany and her new capabilities through \ngreater 1945. \n\n5. The new submarine threat is mounting and we may expect that the Admiralty and our Navy will soon bring pressure to \nbear on the United States Strategic Air Forces to go after submarine yards, pens and components manufacture. The tank \nand armored vehicle industry is proving a fresh and considerable menace in the present Western campaigns, so pressure \nmight be expected from the Ground Armies to devote a part of our bombardment weight to these production centers. A \nspecial report had been prepared by Lt. Col. Haines dealing with the growing menace of jet aircraft... \n\n\nIf this somber assessment did not succeed in warning General McDonald of the true nature of the situation, it was spelled out in no \nuncertain terms in the conclusions at the end of the document: \n\n6. CONCLUSION: \n\n\na. The war has not terminated in accordance with SHAEF plans. \n\nb. SHAEF timing has dominated the development of equipment, training programs and establishment of manpower and \nsupply for this theater. \n\nc. The first cycle and period of the war has ended without the capitulation of Germany and with Germany leading in the \ndevelopment of principal new weapons and methods, which will be included in her capabilities during 1945.— \n\n\nIn other words, the Germans simply were not complying with SHAEF’s desires for them to roll over and surrender in the face of \noverwhelming Allied numerical superiority. Indeed, as the document indicates, that very numerical superiority was threatened with \nimmanent obsolescence, if not being totally obsolete, in 1945. Germany, which had invented modem combined-arms maneuver \nwarfare as a means of offsetting her potential opponents’ numerical superiority, was about to change the nature of warfare yet again, \nand catch the Allies flatfooted, unprepared, and off balance. \n\nBut was the reality of German potential in fact in line with these gloomy Allied intelligence prognostications? \n\n\n\nB. German Potential in Late 1944 Early 1945 \n\n\n\n1. Papers for Paperclip: Project Lusty \n\n\nLate war German war-making potential is perhaps best summarized by a series of recently declassified documents - first \nuncovered by British researcher Nick Cook - called “Project Lusty.” This, as Polish researcher Igor Witkowski observes, was a \n“parallel operation in relation to ‘Paperclip.’”— Its contents are “such an absolute revelation that it gives the impression of being a \nstory from another planet.”— The Project Lusty documents \n\nconsist of a descriptive section as well as a list of intelligence facilities/ “targets” in the occupied Reich. In the descriptive \n\nsection, at the very beginning, mention is made for example... of seized German evacuation transports - U-boats. This concerns \n\nfacts that not only shed a completely new light on the end of World War II and the issue of the Third Reich’s scientific and \n\ntechnical achievements, but above all are shocking with the awareness that they are still clouded in a curtain of secrecy!— \n\nUnder the aegis of this program alone, and by its own admission, some 110,000 tons of scientific papers were transferred over three \nmonths to a center in the United States, where they were then processed and disseminated to the interested agencies of the US \ngovernment. — \n\nAs if that were not enough, \n\nThe records of the German Patent Office, for instance, were found buried 1,500 feet underground in a potash mine near Bacha. \n\nThere were approximately 225,000 volumes, which included secret files.(...) Eventually, the files were evacuated and studied. \n\nThis is a crucial revelation, for it brings us back to the context of the Kammlerstab SS secret weapons “think tank” for the simple \nreason that all patents in the Third Reich were secretly scrutinized by a highly classified SS entity called Forschung, Entwicklung, \nPatente, which answered to an SS Ohergruppen fuhrer Emil Mazuw, about whom more will be said in chapter four. \n\nProject Lusty’s revelation accordingly prompts a very serious question: did the American intelligence teams simply “blindly \nstumble onto” this treasure trove? Or were they led there? The last possibility seems more likely, as it is known that Kammler \nreturned to Prague and the Skoda Works at Pilsen - headquarters of his “think tank” - in the last days of the war. As Nick Cook \nhypothesizes, Kammler did so to put the finishing touches on gathering up all his files and gathering them together to barter for his \nlife.— Thus, if the Americans knew where to look, this information could only have come to them from some source inside the \nKammlerstab. \n\nIt is well known that SS General Wolff undertook secret surrender negotiations with OSS station chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, in \nthe closing days of the war. What is little known, however, is that this process was taking place with the tacit blessing of none other \nthan Adolf Hitler and Nazi Party Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, by then the real master of Nazi Germany. As Carter Hydrick has \nargued, the classic signature of Bormann in all these late-war negotiations with the Americans was the exchange of technology for \nthe lives of leading Nazis.— This permits one to speculate on a secret history that possibly underlies the strange constellation of \nevents in southern and south central Germany, and Bohemian Czechoslovakia, at the end of the war. Among those events one must \nhighlight the following: \n\n1. U.S. General Patton’s rapid drive across southern Germany toward the Skoda Works at Pilsen in Czechoslovakia and similar \nAllied thrusts toward the Harz Mountain SS installations in Thuringia; \n\n2. The secret negotiations between OSS station chief Allen Dulles— and SS General Wolff; \n\n3. The disappearance of SS General Hans Kammler; \n\n4. The disappearance of Kammler’s most highly classified research project, “the Bell,” along with all its project documentation; \nand finally, \n\n5. The ironic - and some would say extremely suspicious - death of General George Patton shortly after the war’s end. \n\nA speculative pattern emerges, for if Wolff was secretly negotiating with Dulles with the tacit approval of Bormann - and Bormann’s \napproval meant Hitler’s as well - then it is likely that the collateral was the treasure trove of the Kammlerstab’s documents, which \nwould have included the secret patents of the Third Reich, seized and classified by the Forschung, Entwicklung, und Patente. The \nunerring precision with which late war American thrusts - largely by Patton’s Third Army - toward the most secret centers and \ninstallations of Kammler’s black projects empire were guided can only indicate that at some very high level the Americans were \nreceiving “inside information” that came from an equally high level within the Third Reich: Kammler and Bormann. Patton may \n\n\neither have been the point man in some of these operations, or, as is more likely, was simply privy to a vast amount of first hand field \nintelligence reports that allowed him to piece together a thorough and nearly complete overview of the extent of Nazi black projects. \nOne may speculate that Patton’s field reports at this time constituted a kind of “Kammler Index” of the Third Reich’s secret weapons \nprojects. In either case, he would have been in a position to disclose a vast and hidden intelligence operation, not the least of which \nincluded a Faustian bargain for exotic technology and post-war cooperation between the Nazis and the western Allies, particularly \nwith the United States. \n\nAnd what of the treasure trove itself? A glance at more unusual German secret weapons will demonstrate why General Patton in \nearly 1945 - perhaps already “in the loop” on the secret negotiations taking place, and the “technological potential” the Allies faced if \nthose negotiations were not successful - expressed serious private reservations about the Allies “still being able to lose this war.” \n\n\n\n2. Death Beneath the Seas: The Extraordinary Capabilities of the Type XXI U-boat \n\n\nWhile Project Lusty concerned itself exclusively with Nazi aero-space technology, it is worth mentioning one of the deadliest \npotentials that was already coming into production as the war approached its end: the very new, and very lethal, German Type XXI \nU-boat. The Type XXI thus represented no mere prototype waiting to see production; it was not mere potential. It was a very real \nand present danger that would have presented the Allies with no end of difficulties at sea had the war continued even just a few \nweeks longer. And as I averred in Reich of the Black Sun, it is likely that the British had the misfortune of encountering a few Type \nXXIs before the end of hostilities.— \n\nThe Type XXIs possessed a novel propulsion system, the Walther turbine utilizing hydrogen peroxide, that allowed a speed of \nsome 17.2 knots submerged, and according to the first trials information of the Kriegsmarine, were capable of a truly astonishing \nsubmerged depth of 330 meters! - Some statements placed its submerged speed closer to 21 or 22 knots.— Moreover, the Type XXI \ncould continue at this phenomenal underwater speed for some 340 miles before having to slow to recharge its accumulators.— Thus, \nthe Type XXI, unlike the subs of every other navy or even its predecessors in the Kriegsmarine, was not merely a submersible; it \nwas, in fact, the first truly modem submarine vessel, a vessel designed to do most of its traveling under water, not merely a vessel \nthat could submerge when necessary. With its special “radar absorbent material” coating its newer streamlined schnorkel device, and \nits tremendous maximum possible submerged depth, the submarine managed to be undetectable to American surface vessels at a \nmere 200 meters away when the U.S. Navy conducted tests on one specimen in 1946!— As Polish researcher Igor Witkowski puts \nit, the submarine “was a jump from the level of the 1940s into the 1960s.”— \n\nBut even this recitation does not even begin to exhaust its truly deadly potential in naval warfare. If an Allied aircraft somehow \nmanaged to elude its on board radar and four 20 millimeter turreted anti-aircraft guns on either side of the boat’s streamlined conning \ntower, the submarine could be completely under water in a mere 18 seconds.— But that is not all, for unlike any other submarine in \nany other navy, the Type XXI’s captain would not even have to see his target to fire torpedos at it: \n\nThe submarine possessed a completely revolutionary system of torpedo fire control, enabling it to carry out effective attacks \neven at complete submersion, the target positions being determined by creating threedimensional co-ordinates of the noise’s \nsource through recalculating of delays received by various microphones placed on the submarine’s hull. After an attack the \nType XXI escaped at maximum speed, at which the enemy’s sonar was totally ineffective (it maintained effectiveness up to \napprox. 12 knots).— \n\nThe potential of the Type XXI was thus not a mere “potential.” It was a deadly reality. \n\nOne can only imagine what a Type XXI equipped with the new wire-guided or acoustic-homing torpedoes would have done to \nAllied shipping had it entered service in sufficient numbers. After all, a Type XXI with conventional torpedos was bad enough... \n\n\n3. Death in the Air: The Sound Barrier Too? \n\n\nThe Project Lusty documentation referred to previously indicates that the Type XXI’s deadly performance characteristics were \nmatched, if not surpassed, by similar German developments in aerial warfare. \n\nWith the Allied and Soviet Air Forces’ increasing dominance of the skies over Germany, it became increasingly vital for the \nLuftwaffe to pursue the unconventional avenue toward recovering mastery of the air over Germany. One such solution, the Focke \nWulfe Triebfliigel, is well-known to researchers. This “vertical take-off and landing” or VTOL fighter was a viable solution, since \nthere was no need to try to take off or land on bombed and cratered airfield runways. Consisting of three rotating wings around a \ncentral fuselage, each wing was tipped with a ramjet engine. The wings could in turn be rotated to increase or decrease the angle of \nattack. With rockets to assist the ramjets to get started, the Triebfliigel was in effect a vertical take-off and landing jet-airplane \ncombined with a helicopter. Witkowski describes it as follows: \n\n(The) name could be translated as “propulsive wing”, reflecting its unusual principle of operation. During take-off and landing \nthe lifting surfaces performed the function of a helicopter’s rotor, whereas during flight at high speed they “transformed” into \nwings.... Three ramjet engines were mounted on the wing tips, each with a maximum thrust of 840 KG. During take-off they \nwere boosted by three Walter rocket engines, accelerating the wings to a speed enabling the ramjet engines to be started. — \n\nPrior to the publication in English of Witkowski’s research, however, little was known about the performance capabilities of this \nunconventional aircraft, and it remained a curiosity. \n\nWitkowski, however, managed to procure a post-war Polish report on the actual test results the craft managed to achieve: \n\nThe maximum vertical speed did not exceed 124 km/h. After climbing to a sufficient altitude, the aircraft commenced horizontal \nflight with the adjustment of control surfaces and ailerons.(...) In horizontal flight the aircraft reached a speed of 1,000 km/h. \n\nThe rotor operated at 520 rpm, which after conversion gave a rotational speed of the tips of 1,500 km/h. \n\nThe initial rate of climb amounted to 7.5 km/min. Rotor working time -42 min., range 640 km. At an altitude of 11 km \nhorizontal speed amounted to 800 kmlh. - \n\nNote that the speed of the craft at normal altitudes was 1,000 kilometers per hour, or approximately 600 miles per hour. Note also \nthat the craft was apparently capable of reaching altitudes of some 11 kilometers, or about six and a half miles above the surface, far \nabove the normal operational altitudes of most Allied and Soviet aircraft of the war. \n\nThe performance characteristics cited are made even more remarkable by the fact that the Triebfliigel and similar craft were \napparently brought to the United States as part of Project Lusty: \n\nA report reached Lt Col. O’Brien’s party that a “strange aircraft” had been seen in a mountainous retreat near Salzburg. \nInvestigation quickly determined that this “strange aircraft: was a jet-propelled helicopter, the only one of its kind in the world. \nThe inventor and his entire staff, who had laboriously worked ten years to perfect it, were present, guarding his invention as \none would a precious jewel. The helicopter was examined, and a preliminary superficial interrogation of the staff was sufficient \nto reveal its tremendous importance. It was carefully loaded in a large truck and taken to Munich. From there it was sent across \nEurope to France, placed on a boat and shipped to Wright Field, together with the confiscated notes, drawings, and meticulous \nrecords of experiments conducted by the scientist and his assistants.— \n\nThe Triebfliigel and similar other projects were thus for the American military no mere curiosities. They represented significant \ntechnological advances over then existent American aerospace technology. \n\nBut now a question occurs: if the machine - and there was only one such of its kind in the world - was brought to Wright \nPatterson Airfield- - and its scientists interred and papers confiscated, how did the post-war Polish Communist government know so \nmuch about its performance within six years of the war’s end? The standard answer is, of course, that there were Soviet spies wi t hin \nthe program, and that is the most likely explanation. But there is another possible answer that will loom ever larger as we proceed, \nand that is that it is possible that all these programs were continued after the war in a variety of host countries including Russia, and \nyet were independently coordinated from some hidden center, passing information back and forth between the cells in various host \ncountries via a continuing “Nazi International”. \n\nThe Triebfliigel also points to another direction wartime German research pursued, and pursued with a vengeance: high \nperformance ramjet-propelled aircraft. Indeed, when entering this area of inquiry, one is again entering one of those areas where the \nreality of wartime German accomplishments in secret weapons research was in diametric contradiction to the post-war Allied \n\n\nLegend, only in this case, the legend is not about the Allies having acquired the a-bomb while the Nazis remained incompetent \nnuclear bunglers, but about the fact that an American, Chuck Yeager, was the first human to pilot an aircraft through the sound \nbarrier, an event that occurred after the war’s end and the beginning of America’s own black projects in exotic aircraft and space- \nbased weapons. \n\nThe story begins with the acknowledged expert on ramjets, Prof. Dr. Alexander Lippisch, and his designs for a delta-winged P- \n13b ramjet aircraft. The goal of the project was to produce a super-sonic aircraft with a cheap, reliable propulsion system. Lippisch \nproduced a number of designs, beginning with the P-12. \n\nLippisch’s P-12 Design \n\n\n\nWork on this aircraft was interrupted in May 1944, and Lippisch produced the design for the cleaner lines of the P13b. \n\n\nLippisch’s PI 3b Design \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large air intakes for the ramjets and the disk-shaped combustion chamber are clearly evident. Wind tunnel trials soon showed the \nadvantages of the pure delta shape for supersonic flight, however, and Lippisch produced his final design for the PI3b, the final \ndesign for which is described in a U.S. intelligence summary for April, 1945: \n\n\nThe Final Version of the Lippisch PI 3b According to a US Intelligence Summary of April 1945 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n\" D«IU \" Aircraft dciip is shown in this plan of \nthe wilder tvpe. from prisoner's description, and clearly \nillustrates (he radical triangular shape of these aircraft. \nThe follow mw components are annotated \n\n1.

Rudder \n\n\nThe remarkable thing about the P13b development is that according to one version, the pure delta version, i.e., the final version seen \nimmediately above, was the version that went through comprehensive trials in 1945. The design in fact, was completed by January \n7, 1945.— \n\nBut did this fantastic supersonic fighter ever progress beyond the planning and wind-tunnel test stages? Enter Project Lusty once \nagain. Frame 599 of the documentation lists the various actual aircraft that were brought to the Wright Airfield in the United States \nfor “extended study and development.”— As the documents state, “at least one, in some cases as many as ten, of the following, \nwhich represent only a fraction of the types (of aircraft), were located, some only after extensive searching throughout Germany.”— \nThe report then lists the types of aircraft, not just documents, that were seized: \n\nThe Messerschmitt aircraft series 1101, 1106, 1110, 1111 and 1112, a series particularly interesting in that it illustrates a phase \nof coordinated aircraft design into which American aircraft are only now entering; seven rocket-propelled piloted aircraft \nspecifically designed for anti-bomber interception work; a jet-propelled helicopter; Flettner- 282 helicopter; Horton-9, a flying \nwinged glider; Ju-188, a radar equipped twin-engine night fighter; Ju-290, four-engine long range transport; seven Me-163s, \nrocket-propelled interceptor fighters; ten Me-262s, twin jet-propelled fighter-interceptors; He-162, single place fighter powered \nby jet engines; flying bombs, type V-l single and dual piloted; Lippisch P-13 Jager( sic)^-, a tailless twin rocket-propelled wing \nfor supersonic speeds...— \n\nThe report clearly indicates that an actual aircraft, and not just a model, was brought to the United States, though it clearly has \nmisidentified the fighter’s rocket engines as the main propulsion unit. They were necessary only to reach sufficient speed to start the \nramjets. \n\nBut the truly sensational bit of information concerning the PI3b that emerges from the Project Lusty documents occurs in frame \n601, where the top recorded speed for the P13b is stated as Mach 1.85, “about 2100 km/h” or approximately 1200 miles per hour.— \nUFO researches will recognize that figure, because it appears often in newspaper accounts of UFO performance characteristics from \nthe post-war period on into the 1950s. In any case, Polish military files indicate that the craft was prepared for, and successfully \nundertook, comprehensive trials ca. January-February 1945, and that indeed, the sound barrier had been broken by the Germans \nduring that time, though no mention is made of the test pilot’s name.— \n\nThe fact of the PI3b’s incredible speed and the uniqueness and simplicity of its combustion chamber, would have meant nothing \nless than an aerial warfare revolution had the war lasted a little longer and the aircraft had seen production. The reason is quite \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsimple: it was cheap, impervious to Allied radar, and utterly beyond the performance capabilities of the proto-type British and \nAmerican jet fighters only just beginning to be tested. Indeed, the performance characteristics of the PI3b would only be matched by \nthe “X planes” of the early American space program some years later. \n\nAs for Lippisch himself, he became something of a celebrity at Wright Airfield in Dayton, Ohio, since he was recognized as the \nleading authority on supersonic flight. Lippisch conducted seminars and lectures for his new American bosses.— More importantly, \nLippisch had also completed designs for an orbiting space station capable of dropping nuclear bombs on any target on earth.— \n\n\n4. Death on the Ground: Weapons of Mass Destruction in Use by the German Army on the Eastern Front in 1941 \n\n\nBeyond these deadly aerial and submarine developments of the late war, there were already indicators that something had long \nbeen afoot on the ground as well, as persistent rumors came from the Eastern Front that the German Army, on more than one \noccasion, had used some weapon of enormous destructive power on Russian military targets. In Reich of the Black Sun I indicated \nthat this was most likely some early version of a fuel-air bomb, a device that the Germans had brought, by the end of the war, to \nenormous capability.— The sources for these strange allegations were none other than a secret Japanese communique from its \nembassy in Stockholm, Sweden, to an equally secret communication from the Soviets to the Nazis that if they did not “cease and \ndesist” the Russians would resort to the use of poison gas. \n\nFurther corroboration of this is found in none other than celebrated SS commando Otto Skorzeny’s memoirs. However, he \nrecounts that their first use occurred not in the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimea in 1942, nor indeed with the prologue to the Battle \nof Kursk in 1943, but in the fierce Battle for Moscow during late November and early December of 1941! \n\nTo our left is situated Khmiki, Moscow’s port. From here it is only 8 kilometers to Moscow. On 30 November, without a single \nshot, the 62 nd reconnaissance regiment belonging to Hoepner’s Armoured Corps moves in here. It is not known why this \nopportunity was not exploited. Our motorcyclists retreated. \n\nHere begins the next mysterious episode in the battle for Moscow, which has escaped the attention of many historians. In \norder to oppose the horrifying rockets of “Stalin’s organs” we applied a new type of rocket missile filled with liquid air. These \nwere similar to enormous bombs and as far as my competence allows me to estimate - their effectiveness had no equal. Their \nuse immediately had an impact on the enemy’s defensive forces. The enemy used huge loudspeakers for propaganda \npurposes... By means of them several days after first using our missiles the Russians threatened to respond with gas attacks if \nwe continued to use rockets filled with liquid air. From that moment, at least in our sector, they were never used again. I don’t \nthink they were used on other stretches of the front as well.— \n\nWitkowski confirms the assertion first broached by Renato Vesco that the research for these weapons of mass destruction - a large \nfuel air bomb has the same destructive effect as a small atom bomb - was undertaken by Prof. Dr. Zippermayer under the apt code \nname Hexenkessel or “Witches’ Cauldron.”— \n\n\nDOrOWme* 03T\\IXU> KCU TAWifcTs OP \nOPPOBTOMra IX TH2 SCMTHOPSH ARHA \n\n\nReported by \n\n\nF/Lt H.H.R. \n\nand \n\nF/Lt R.L.

The mat¬ \nerials of the explosive were rneae by the specialists of \nthe h'ooel company. \n\nC. Interrogation of Jo^ei arnot \n\nIn the course of interrogation it became clear, that \n\n\nSkorzeny also indicates the method of delivery was apparently through rocket artillery systems. In point of fact, SS panzer and \npanzer grenadier divisions often had a complement of so-called Nebelwerfer artillery units. These units were six-barreled rocket \nartillery pieces, ranging in caliber from 150mm (about six inches) to 280 mm (about eleven inches). The six barrels of a typical \nNebelwerfer were arranged in a hexagonal pattern on an otherwise conventional split-trail artillery carriage. The 280mm Nebelwerfer \nunits would have been the ideal delivery system for fuel air bombs.— \n\nOne can only guess what the effect of a battery of these weapons firing fuel air bombs on rockets, with their sirens screaming \ndown on their targets, all synchronized to detonate simultaneously, would have had on a Russian unit. The phrase “carpet bombing” \ntogether with “tactical nukes” might, however, come close. \n\nB ut in any case, it is clear why the Russians resorted to the threat of poison gas. And perhaps it is also clear why only recently the \nRussian government has revealed that its casualties during the war were far higher than anyone had previously imagined. \nOperationally competent as the German Army was during World War Two, the fantastic “kill ratios” it achieved on the Eastern \nFront could only have been due to the assistance of unconventional weaponry, and weaponry of mass destruction at that. \n\n\n\n5. Beyond the Nuclear and Thermonuclear Bombs: Indications of a New Physics \n\n\nProject Lusty also corroborates another sensational allegation that we shall encounter much later, namely, that the Nazis were \nengaged in research on various types of “death rays” or “anti-aircraft rays.” This research apparently was undertaken in Vienna at \nnumber 87 Weimarstrasse.— But these were no ordinary lasers. \n\nAccording to Polish researcher Igor Witkowski, the German government’s archives indicate that \n\nIn 1944 a special Luftwaffe research establishment received the task to develop such a weapon, situated in the town of Gross \nOstheim. Materials relating to this work are currently located in a civilian establishment - the Karlsruhe research centre \n(Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe) and were disclosed several years ago.— \n\nAs was seen in Reich of the Black Sun, research was also conducted into exotic “Tesla” technology at the University of Heidelberg, \nwhere an underground bunker was discovered that housed a large artificial quartz parabolic dish which was used to fire high voltage \npulses at targets some meters away to disintegrate them.— In this light it is perhaps worth mentioning that the giant German \nelectronics firm, Siemens A.G., took out one of the first patents for an X-ray laser in the U.S.A. in 1955, — roughly half a decade \nbefore the first masers and lasers were “discovered.” Did the Siemens patent in fact reflect work already undertaken by the Th ir d \nReich? \n\nWhile this cannot be determined with certainty, it is perhaps significant that the Siemens firm seldom reveals the exact nature and \nextent of its research undertaken during the Nazi era. And it is perhaps also significant that Siemens might be trying to protect a \npatent or device previously filed during the Nazi era and subsequently confiscated as booty by taking out a patent for an X-ray laser \nin the United States. \n\nTaken together, all these secret weapons projects - and they are only the tip of a very large, very deadly iceberg - indicate that \nNazi Germany was aiming for supremacy on the ground, sea, and air. But it would be misleading to assume that this was the limit of \ntheir ambitions... \n\n\n2 \n\n\n„The Peenemunde Problem 44 \n\n\n“...Germany’s ‘Amerika-Raket’ was to be armed with a nuclear warhead. The report sounds utterly fantastic. But was the \ndanger real?” \n\nFriedrich Georg, Hitlers Siegeswaffen— \n\n\nIn August 1946, a highly placed department of the English War Office disclosed that “Hitler wanted the Moon.”— In the race of \n“disclosure” after the war’s end and before the iron vaults of “national security” slammed shut and the Allied Legend of atomic \nengineering superiority was bom, such extraordinary revelations were commonplace. Indeed, one must wonder if there was not a \npsychological or disinformation operation being run behind these early post-war disclosures, to direct attention, particularly Soviet \nattention, away from areas of Nazi accomplishments that were not merely paper studies and fantasies. Even here, however, one must \npause, for if Nazi Germany was successful, or even perilously close, in obtaining atom bombs prior to the war’s end, as argued in the \nprevious book on this subject, The Reich of the Black Sun,— then the comment cannot be brushed aside so easily. The War Office \ncomment, and Consolidated Vultee’s two page Life magazine advertisement disclosing the possible existence blueprints a 3,000 mile \nrange rocket in an underground factory implies the existence at least of a rocket technology - and hence the delivery systems for a \nnuclear warhead - considerably more advanced than the puny V-2 with its limited lift and range. As German researcher Friedrich \nGeorg notes, the comment points to the existence of Von Braun’s A-14 moon rocket, a design for a five stage rocket to lift three \nastronauts to the moon and return them to the earth where they would then land in a version of Eric Sanger’s “rocket plane.”— And \nadditionally, Consolidated Vultee’s disclosure also prompts a question: how did they know there were blueprints for such a rocket? \nBlueprints imply something either ready to go into production or something already being built. Where did Consolidated Vultee get \nits information? The answer, as we shall see, is rather surprising. \n\nAnd if five-staged moon rockets to carry three astronauts to the moon and back, and orbital “space planes” sound uncomfortably \nfamiliar, they should, for it would seem that Von Braun’s later Saturn V booster - the actual three stage booster of the three-manned \nApollo moon missions - and the space shuttle itself, are but later developments of some prototypical Nazi design concepts for \nmanned space missions. \n\n\nA. The U.S.A. Gets the Creme de la Creme \n\n\nSuch disconcerting disclosures raise the other components of the Allied Legend, namely: \n\n1. that in the race to acquire Nazi secret weapons, scientists, and engineers and the associated technologies, the Western Allies \nin general and America in particular made off with the lion’s share of the loot, the creme da la creme of the Third Reich’s \nscientists and technology, enabling its successful Apollo moon program and likewise its early ICBM development; \n\n2. that the German “secret weapons” projects consisted mostly of the V-l “buzz bomb”, the V-2 rocket, and half-hearted and \nfailed attempts at atom bomb research, and that after 1942, the Peenemiinde scientists developed little else of practical value \nto realize the fantasies of the Nazi leadership.— No progress was made by the Nazis in long-range rocket bombardment \nbeyond the V-2 besides paper projects that never were practically realized; \n\n3. the Germans were incompetent bunglers when it came to nuclear bomb physics and nowhere close to obtaining the atom \nbomb, much less enough weapons grade uranium (and plutonium?) to make one work. \n\nAs my previous book The Reich of the Black Sun demonstrated, the Allied Legend as regards number (3) is in serious trouble given \nrecent declassifications and research based upon them — Indeed, one may say that the Allied Legend is in need of serious revision, if \nnot of being disposed of completely. \n\nWe now turn to examine the first two components of the Allied Legend. However, this step may seem an odd place to begin a \nbook whose principal subjects are not rockets and atom bombs, but (1) even more destructive and fantastic weapons and the \ntechnologies and science they imply, (2) their continued and possibly independent development, and (3) the possible implications of \nthat development in the most famous political assassination in modem history, the cold-blooded murder of President John F. \nKennedy. Even here, however, the actual state of affairs in German accomplishments in long-range rocketry are completely at \nvariance with the Allied Legend. However, they also afford the best entry into a discussion of the physics and technologies \nassociated with their most highly classified wartime secret weapons project, “The Bell.” \n\nA moment’s reflection demonstrates why components (1) and (2) of the Allied Legend should be questioned, for if the U.S.A. got \nthe creme de la creme of German rocket scientists - Von Braun, General Walter Domberger, Hermann Oberth, Arthur Rudolph, et \nal. - then how does one account for the very early, and consistent, Soviet Russian lead in space achievements during the Cold War, \nright up to the Apollo moon landings? Soviet achievements indicate, as nothing else does, yet another very large hole in the Allied \nLegend. \n\n\nB. The U.S.S.R.’s Early Space Achievements \n\n\nSergei Korolev, the brilliant engineering genius and mastermind of Russia’s early ICBM and space exploration development, like \nhis counterpart Wemher Von Braun in the U.S.A., laid a firm and lasting foundation for Russian space achievement. His influence \npersists to this day, if one considers that Russia’s (and by implication, China’s) Proton boosters are still the largest conventional \nchemical rockets in service, boosters that rely heavily on the basic concepts Korolev pioneered. On the basis of his principles and \naccomplishments, Soviet Russia maintained an early lead over America, racking up the following impressive list of “firsts”: \n\n1. It was the first to launch and orbit an artificial satellite, the famous Sputnik; \n\n2. It was the first to launch an animal - the little dog Laika - into space; \n\n3. It was the first to orbit and successfully return a man into space, Colonel Yuri Gagarin; \n\n4. It was the first to orbit and successfully return a woman into space; \n\n5. It was the first to land unmanned probes successfully on the Moon; \n\n6. It was the first to conduct successfully “extra-vehicular activity,” i.e., a space walk, by humans in orbit; and last but not least, \n\n7. It was the first to place nuclear and thermonuclear warheads on an ICBM, the SS-6 and SS-7 “Sapwood.” \n\nThen, suddenly and quite inexplicably, the Soviet Union seemed to have “lost its drive” when the Apollo 8 mission successfully \norbited, and the Apollo 11 mission successfully landed, humans on the Moon and returned them safely to the Earth. Inexplicably, the \nSoviet Union seemed to “just give up” and, as far as we know, never launched its own manned Moon mission, even though it was \nwell within Russian capabilities. And perhaps equally inexplicably, the U.S.A., sighting “budget cuts” and public disinterest, \ndiscontinued its own Moon program, abandoning the scheduled Apollo 18 through 21 missions, and breaking up its remaining \nSaturn V boosters. The U.S.A. would not return to the Moon until the 1990s, with the Pentagon’s unmanned “Clementine” orbiter. \nThen suddenly China orbited a human, and declared its intention to go to the Moon. Suddenly American interest seemed to change \nagain, and the Bush Administration decided it would be a good idea for America to go back while on our ultimate way to Mars. \n\nFrom World War Two to the present, space represents a strange cast of characters and a strange plot indeed: Hitler, the Soviets led \nby Korolev and his team of German engineers, the Americans and their team of German engineers, the French-dominated European \nspace agency and their team of German engineers, the Japanese, the Indians, and now the Chinese. China is significant for it \nunderscores the actual Soviet achievement, for China’s space technology is but re-worked Soviet technology updated with the latest \nAmerican.. \n\n\n\n1. Booster and Lift Capabilities \n\n\nAll this implies that the Soviet Union developed very early on boosters with enormous thrust and lift capabilities, as the following \ncomparative chart of American and Russian rockets from the 1950s and 1960s illustrates: \n\nAmerican Boosters: \n\n\n\nRussian Boosters \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs even a simple physical comparison demonstrates, in terms of raw boosting power, the Russians were consistently ahead of \nAmerica throughout the earliest years of the Cold War, right down to the Apollo landings themselves. \n\nOf course this is in part explained by the fact that the Russians had to develop rockets with greater thrust than America for two \nimportant reasons. First, they were less successful in miniaturizing components than the Americans, and consequently, pound for \nfunctional pound, their rockets tended to be heavier. But there is a much more important and obvious reason. Given its relatively \nmore northern latitude, the Russians could not take advantage of the greater angular velocity of the earth as could the Americans, \nsituated as they were at more southern latitudes. At the latitude of Cape Canaveral, the angular velocity of the earth is greater than at \nthe Soviet Baikonur Kosmodrome, and hence, American rockets were not required to generate as much thrust to lift similar \npayloads. \n\nBut all this really only serves to underscore the Russian achievement all the more. Working under more restrictive conditions, they \novercame them. How then was Korolev and his design team able to achieve such early and stunning success with their boosters, \nespecially since the U.S.A. was supposed to have gained the “creme de la creme” of German rocket scientists and engineers? \n\n\nThe First ICBM: The Russian “Sapwood”; The Same Booster was used to Launch Mankind’s First Artificial Satellite, the Sputnik \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The First ICBMs and the Characteristic Russian “Bundle ” Rocket \n\n\nA closer glance at the first Russian ICBM, the same rocket used to launch and orbit Sputnik, with their typical “shape” distinctive \nof Russian boosters all the way up to the massive Proton booster, shows how. As the close-ups of the “Sapwood” show, the typical \nRussian booster is not so much a single rocket but a “bundle” of rockets fastened around a central shaft which is itself another \nengine. \n\n\n\nC. What’s Wrong with This Picture? \n\n\nClearly, something is wrong with this picture. The U.S.A. did get the best and brightest of Nazi rocket scientists and technology, \nyet, the Russians made away with scores of “middle” echelon scientists and engineers. How then did Korolev hit upon the brilliant \nand simple expedient of the “bundle” rocket? \n\nThe standard explanation is that Korolev while on a walk in the woods around his dacha in Moscow was inspired by the root \nsystems of enormous trees. They suggested to him the distinctive shape and concept of the Soviet “bundle rocket” boosters.— In the \nlight of the now known state of German wartime rocketry, however, this cannot be anything other than an attempt to deflect attention \naway from the real origin of the concept, for as a simple expedient to achieve quick heavy lift capability, it is a characteristic more of \na nation at war - and in a hurry - straining to achieve a swift entry to space and long-range rocket bombardment capabilities. It is an \nexpedient that - like the Nazi decision to pursue only a uranium-fueled atom bomb - fits the practical requirements of Nazi Germany. \n\n\nD. The Real Origin of the Bundle Rocket: “Projekt Zossen ” \n\n\nNot surprisingly, then, the real origin of the “bundle rocket” booster concept was in wartime Nazi Germany, where the idea was \nbom - in 1942! - to “bundle together” five V-2 rocket engines, and fire them simultaneously, to achieve greater lift and range \ncapability. The plan was called “Project Zossen,” a clue, perhaps, that the origin of the idea came from within the OKW’s super \nsecret underground communications and command bunker in Zossen, a suburb of Berlin. In any case, the project was more than just \na “paper project” for two designs were actually modeled and wind tunnel tests were performed on them, as indicated by the \nfollowing pictures of German wind tunnel test models: \n\nThe Bundle Rocket Design Test Model: The Rocket Model is in Front of a Larger Rocket inside the circle \n\n\n\nClose-up of the German “Bundle Rocket” \n\n\n\n\nThis expedient had the advantage over designing, testing and building an entirely new rocket in that the V-2’s components and \nperformance capabilities were known quantities, already tested, and in production. And clearly Korolev’s boosters are but a \nstreamlined second generation version of the earlier Nazi prototype. But was a full scale version of the rocket, or for that matter, any \nof the other intercontinental rocket designs the Nazis had proposed, ever tested? To answer that question, we return to Peenemiinde, \nat the end of the war, and notice yet another “problem.” \n\n\nE. SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammlers “Evacuation” of Peenemiinde and the Russian Arrival \n\n\nIs there any indication that these early German ICBM “bundle rockets” or any other long-range strategic rockets went to actual \nconstruction and testing? If so, then the logical choice was Peenemiinde, for in spite of the heavy attention of Allied bombers, it was \nthe only place presumably with facilities large enough to achieve the task. \n\n\n\n1. Strange Events at an “Empty” Site \n\n\nGeneral Walter Domberger made it clear that as early as 1939 the ultimate goal of the Peenemiinde center was to create a long \nrange rocket capable of striking New York City and other targets on the east coast of the United States. Of course, this implies a \ncapability to strike all of European Russia as well. — By July 29, 1940, at Peenemiinde the engineer Graupe had already produced \nthe first designs for a trans-Atlantic 2 stage rocket. Hermann Oberth began his own formal studies for the fuel and lift requirements \nfor such a rocket in October of 1941,— as the Wehrmacht continued to liquidate the Red Army in Operation Barbarossa. \n\nBut more to the point is a letter from the Reich’s emerging “plenipotentiary for secret weapons development,” SS \nObergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler, dated October 1943, and stating that the development of the Amerikaraket continued apace.— \nMoreover, there exist estimates for cost, labor, and material for the “America Rocket” that strongly suggest that it had become more \nthan a mere “paper project.” As with anything else in Kammler’s black empire of black projects, anything suggesting “labor” meant \nthe slave labor of concentration camps, and to suggest that the project was merely a “paper project” is to diminish the human \nsuffering that was involved in its very real flesh and blood actualization. \n\nAnother factor must be weighed. As indicated in my previous book on German secret weapons, The Reich of the Black Sun, there \nis a circumstantial case that the Nazis successfully tested an atom bomb ca. Oct. 10 th , 1944, on the island of Riigen, or possibly some \nother island, standing along the German Baltic coast in the sea lanes running from Konigsburg to Kiel.— This would imply that some \ntime earlier in the summer of that year, the SS achieved some sort of breakthrough in its bomb program, perhaps finally acquiring \nenough critical mass to test in a bomb. In any case, the alleged Riigen test was successful, and as German researcher Friedrich Georg \nobserves, the call then went out for “secure delivery systems.”— It stands to reason then, that the Amerikaraket, given this alleged \natomic bomb success and actual fuel air bomb success,— was much more than a “paper rocket.” By the time of its successful testing \nin 1944, the paper studies and wind tunnel tests were already two years old! The rocket was, in other words, on the track to actual \ntesting and production. \n\nAll this leads us to General Kammler’s January 31, 1945 order to evacuate Peenemiinde. According to the standard line, the \nexplanation for this curious order is that the Red Army was expected to arrive at any moment. But the Red Army would not arrive at \nPeenemiinde until May 4 th !— This poses a significant question: Was Peenemiinde, as Friedrich Georg puts it, merely a “ghost town” \nfor the three months from the evacuation order to the Russian arrival?— The order is even more curious given the fact that, since the \nmassive British Royal Air Force raid in 1943 that all but destroyed the facility, the process had already begun of moving as much of \nthe V-2 production to underground sites as possible. True, the process was slow and still continuing when Kammler’s 1945 order \ncame down, but nonetheless, it was already well under way. By early 1945 most of the V-2 production was at the massive \nunderground factory of the notorious Mittelwerk at Nordhausen. Thus the problem: Why give an order for something already taking \nplace? \n\nOne late war incident suggests, and suggests quite strongly, that this was not the case, for on March 9, 1945, a British twin-engine \nphoto-reconnaissance Mosquito fighter-bomber was chased from Peenemiinde by no less than three German Messerschmitt 262 jet \nfighters.— Of course, one possible explanation for the British presence at the site was that they were simply trying to confirm what \ntheir intelligence had probably already told them, namely, that Peenemiinde had been evacuated. \n\nBut while that may explain the presence of the RAF Mosquito, it is not a good explanation for the - by that late date - relatively \nheavy presence of the Fuftwaffe in the form of no less than three of its rare and valuable Messerschmitt 262 jet fighters. Three jets \njust to chase an unarmed British photo-reconnaissance plane from a “ghost town”? Clearly this makes no sense, and implies that \nsomething was still taking place at Peenemiinde, something very secret and very important, something requiring all the protection the \ncrumbling Fuftwaffe could muster. \n\nSeen in this way Kammler’s “evacuation” order of January 31, 1945 thus appears to be a clever ploy by the security-obsessed SS \ngeneral, designed to throw Allied and Soviet intelligence off the trail of whatever was still going on there. Since most of the V-l and \nV-2 teams were long gone from Peenemiinde to their new underground facilities, something else must have been going on that \nmerited such heavy protection. \n\nBut what was it? \n\nFortunately, there do exist reports that during the period from March to April (and perhaps as late as May) 1945 that there were at \nleast four tests of a large rocket named “Thor’s Hammer” or the Amerikaraket. These reports moreover name both Peenemiinde and \nOhrdruf - site of the second alleged German a-bomb test on March 4, 1945— - as the possible sites of these tests. It is unlikely that \nOhrdruf functioned as a test site for such a large rocket, since there was present there none of the necessary facilities to assemble and \nlaunch such a vehicle. So one is left with Peenemiinde, the most likely place. In any case, three of these tests were allegedly shots of \nthe Amerikaraket into the Atlantic, and a fourth test was allegedly to see if orbit could be achieved!— \n\n\nBut there is even further corroboration of mysterious goings-on at Peenemiinde at the war’s end. \n\n\n\n2. The “Urals Incident” \n\n\nOddly, while Peenemiinde was visited only lightly by the British RAF after its massive 1943 air raid, it was visited often, and \nheavily, by the Soviet Red Air Force right up to the war’s end, suggesting that, if the British had fallen for Kammler’s ruse, the \nSoviets had not. It is an indication that they knew something that the Allies did not. \n\nLate-war German long-range rocket activity is corroborated, in fact, by the Russians themselves. In the Spanish language edition \nof the Soviet Russian science magazine Sputnik there is a report of the destruction in 1945 - during the war - of a Russian munitions \nfactory in the Ural Mountains near the river Tobol. Notably, the article ascribed the destruction to a “terror attack” of “fascist \nperfidy” much like “the later attacks of American B-52 bombers against the port city of Haiphong in Vietnam.”— If the Russian \nreport is accurate and not merely a typical Communist exercise in disinformation or blame-shifting for their own bureaucratic \nincompetence, then this most probably was a rocket attack, since by that late date in the war the Luftwaffe had little left by way of \nlong range heavy bombers able to make the trip,— a trip that in any case had little prospect of success given the Red Air Force’s \nmastery of the skies over eastern Europe. Only a rocket attack could guarantee success for such an operation. \n\nGiven all the foregoing, it is reasonable to conclude that the Nazis may actually have been successful in testing the first strategic \nballistic missiles toward the end of the war, while falling just short of getting them into production. \n\n....or is that too, yet another dangerous myth? \n\nWe shall answer that question in a subsequent chapter. \n\nFor now, we address another question. If the Nazis had indeed tested such long-range rockets, much less successfully fired one on \nSoviet Russia, then this implies that yet another phase of the Amerikaraket went beyond merely being a “paper study.” The Nazis \ncould have tested all the long range rockets they wished, but they would have been utterly useless without a means to guide them to \ntarget. \n\nThus, the existence of a credible long range and secure guidance system is also corroborative evidence that the Amerikaraket was \nnot just a paper project. The question is, did the Nazis have such means of guidance? The answer is yes, and they did not just exist \non paper. \n\n\nF. Over-the-Horizon Radars and the Amerikaraket \n\n\nSuccessful German tests of long range rockets, much less an actual German rocket attack on Russian sites in the Urals, implies the \nexistence of associated technologies and methods to guide such missiles accurately to their targets. Indeed, from the scientific and \nengineering point of view in the early 1940s, accurate guidance of such rockets was the principal problem that the Germans faced, \nnot the actual rocket itself. A number of methods were therefore proposed to make the Amerikaraket accurate, some technological, \nothers less so. \n\nGiven that the Amerikaraket was intended to carry “small atom bombs”— and “other weapons of mass destruction,’— and since \nthe inertial guidance system of the V-2 would have been inadequate and inaccurate for attacking targets on the American east coast, \nthe Nazis had to consider a variety of alternative modes for guidance. In other words, if the Amerikaraket was not a paper project, \nthen one should expect the Germans to be working in each of the following areas: \n\n1. technological and secure means of guiding a rocket to targets at long range; or, failing that, \n\n2. alternative methods of guiding a rocket accurately to a target at long range; and, \n\n3. technologies of miniaturizing enough rocket and/or A-bomb (or H-bomb or fuel-air bomb)^- components to enable a long \nrange rocket to be able to carry such heavy payloads. \n\nViewed in this way, the Amerikaraket was anything but a paper project, since the Nazis considered any number of methods, from \n“back-pack” piloted rockets, to enable a pilot to guide the rocket to target visually before bailing out at the last minute, to actually \nplanting a radio transponder inside the Empire State Building for a rocket to home in on,— to much more sophisticated and ultimately \nmuch more secure technological means of guidance based on beam riding and radar interference. It is this last category that is of \nmost interest to our purposes in this book, for it is this last area of development that points very clearly to Nazi interest in, and \ndevelopment of, areas of physics ultimately very different than those pursued by their Allied counterparts. \n\n\n1. The German Proto-Transistor And Television Minaturization \n\n\nBefore examining German accomplishments in the technology of long-range rocket guidance, it is necessary to examine their \nsuccess in the equally important area of miniaturization of components. Such a step was absolutely necessary if the Third Reich was \never to be successful in wedding its atom bomb - a notoriously heavy device in those days - to a rocket. Indeed, as I pointed out in \nReich of the Black Sun, any and every method appears to have been pursued by Kammler’s SS Sonderkommando, including \ntechniques of boosting nuclear fission of atomic nuclei to lower the weight of the critical mass of a nuclear warhead.— But there \nwere other successes in miniaturization. \n\nIt is well known that Nazi Germany, during the infamous 1936 Berlin Olympics, successfully created the first live television \nbroadcast of a sports event for a general public. The following is a picture of one of the large and cumbersome television cameras - \nthen “state of the art” - that were stationed at crucial locations around the Olympic stadium at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. \n\n1936 German Television Camera at the Berlin Olympics \n\n\n\nTelevision sets were placed at various locations in the Olympic village and the environs of Greater Berlin to allow the visiting \nathletes, tourists and German citizens to watch the games as they occurred. Needless to say, for Dr. Josef Gobbels’ Propaganda \nMinistry it was a propaganda coup of the first order, and a clear demonstration to the world of German technological prowess. \n\nDuring the war, however, television quickly suggested itself to the Germans as a means of visually guiding a short-range missile \nto target by placing a television camera in the nose of a missile. Transmitting a picture back to an operator on the ground or in an \nairplane, the rocket could then be unerringly guided to target. And by war’s end, they had successfully tested the first such “smart \nbomb.”— \n\nObviously, placing a television camera of the size of those used in the 1936 Olympic Games inside a missile was impractical, and \nso the camera had to be considerably miniaturized. \n\nBy the war’s end, the Germans had been hugely successful in this task, accomphshing an almost tenfold reduction in size, as this \nphoto of a small television camera and receiver set, about the size of a large shoebox, attests: \n\n\nMiniature German Television Camera for Missile Guidance \n\n\n\n\nMoreover, this miniaturization implies something enormously important, and its importance will become more and more apparent as \nwe proceed in part two of this work, for such a tremendous reduction in size implies some sort of breakthrough in vacuum tube \ntechnology, if not in semi-conductor research itself. \n\nThe mention of semi-conductors is intentional, for they may have accomplished much more, as the following picture \ndemonstrates: \n\nGerman “Proto-Transistor” from 1940 \n\n\n\nIVMunken \n\n\nThe pictured klystron tube is the same approximate size as the last knuckle and fingertip of the reader’s little finger! \n\nIn short, the Germans came exceedingly close, very early in the war, by virtue of competent research in semi-conductors, to \nachieving the transistor, for the Allied equivalent of this little tube at the end of the war is ten times as large! This little “proto¬ \ntransistor”, dating from 1940 (!), was used in 1941 in small radios that actually entered production for the German military, radios \nthat were “as small as the later transistor radios of the 1950s and that also functioned with batteries.”— \n\nThe mere existence of this little tube is the first glimpse of a very significant problematic that will preoccupy us in part three of this \nbook, and that was mentioned in the last two chapters of my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun. The \nproblematic may be ghmpsed here as a kind of preview to part three, and it is best stated in conjunction with Lt. Col. Philip J. \nCorso’s book, The Day After Roswell. \n\n\n\n2. The Problem of the Miniature German Klystron Tube: Roswell, The E. T. Myth and the Nazi Legend Revisited \n\n\nLt. Col. Philip J. Corso (US Army, Ret.) was perhaps something of a Godsend to UFO enthusiasts, for he corroborated - at least \non the surface - the whole Roswell UFO-and-ET-crash and recovery scenario in his well-known book, The Day After Roswell. \nCorso’s thesis is familiar to most people who have investigated the UFO literature. \n\nIn his post as a top national security military officer, Corso maintains in his book that he was entrusted with some of the \n“recovered technology” from the “alien craft” that crashed at Roswell. His assignment was gradually to “seed” those aspects of \n“recovered ET technology” into American industry. Corso further maintains that among some of this “recovered and gradually \nseeded” technology were lasers, computers, fiber optics, and transistors.— Of course, after the book’s appearance and Corso’s own \nappearance on a popular overnight radio talk show, critical and historical analysis was all but suspended, and there was a further \nboost to the “ET\" interpretation of the Roswell incident, all as a result of his book. \n\nCrucial to Corso’s case was the transistor, and he spends a great deal of time in his book demonstrating that his thesis of its “ET- \nRoswell” origin has to be true by pointing out that the history of the discovery of the transistor by Bell Laboratories is obscure at \nbest.— The reason? Very simple. The transistor had no prior “discovery history” because it was “ET” in origin. \n\nBut given what has now been demonstrated, we propose that, like the ambiguity in the MAJIC-12 documents themselves - \nvacillating between technologies clearly exotic though terrestrial and an “ET” cover story - there is another possible explanation for \nthe origin of the transistor, one which, as we saw in Reich of the Black Sun,— it would appear that the highest authorities, including \nthe military, wish to keep covered up. That other possible source for the transistor, one that would much more satisfactorily explain \nits obscure discovery history than the ET hypothesis, is wartime Nazi research and accomplishment in semiconductor research. \n\nSimply put, Corso’s work is, in this respect at least, pure obfuscation and disinformation, since one can only assume that a man of \nCorso’s obvious intelligence could not have been unaware of German wartime scientific achievements, as plausibly demonstrated by \nthe above miniature tube, fully seven years before the Roswell incident and its recovery of “advanced ET technology.” \n\nBut there are other aspects of Corso’s work that must also be called into question vis-a-vis the state of Nazi secret weapons \nresearch. It is well known that the Germans undertook and developed a wide range of infrared sites to enhance the night-fighting \nability of their tanks and infantry. What is not generally known is the apparently high state of development of second and third \ngeneration technologies these infrared sites may have represented, for Polish researcher Igor Witkowski uncovered a certain amount \nof evidence in a recently declassified Alsos report that indicates preliminary work was undertaken in liquid crystals and something \nthe Germans called “optical telephony.”— This is an extremely intriguing discovery, because fiber optics is yet another technology \nthat Col. Corso maintained was recovered from “ET” at Roswell and “gradually seeded” into American industry. \n\n\n3. Over the Horizon Radars \n\n\nOne little known aspect of German wartime research is the area of over-the-horizon radars. While the Nazis were pursuing a \nnumber of options for the guidance of their intercontinental Amerikaraket, including a piloted version from which the pilot would \neject at the last moment, the most preferred method was “beam riding,” a method that would allow the rocket to be guided to target \nby a beam. One project consisted of placing a secret radio transmitter inside the Empire State building for the purpose!— \n\nBut by far the most serious and promising - and technologically involved - methods were the various Over-the-Horizon Radars \nthat the Germans were developing for the purpose, the sets Elefant, See-Elefant, and the mobile Freya unit. The Elefant set was \ndeveloped by the Research Department of the Deutsche Reischspost , and was the world’s first genuine over-the-horizon radar based \non temperature inversions in the ionosphere.— The See-Elefant was a further development of this equipment, and was built in \nwestern Denmark and consisted of a sending antenna, approximately 100 meters high, placed between two permanent receiving \nantennae some distance to either side. It was a broadband antenna system, operating in the 23-29 MHz, 24-30MHz, and 30- 38 MHz \n\noo \n\nrange.— \n\nBut the most advanced of these early over-the-horizon radars was the Frey a unit, a “revolutionary system” that was “fully \nmobile.”— The Freya unit’s basic principle of operation is visible from this German schematic from 1945: \n\nGerman Schematic of Freya’s Basic Operating Principle \n\n\n\n4 *9/*S \n\n\nThe basic idea is evident from an artist’s sketch dated March 30, 1945, of the Freya unit emplaced and ready to transmit. The \ndiagram labels each of these antennae the Sende und Empfangs-Antennae, the Sende Antenna I and Send Antenna II.— Thus, the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreya unit represents a considerably newer and different principle than the Elefant or See-Elefant, with their single sending and two \nreceiving antennae. The central sending and receiving antenna sends out a pulse, which is also sent as secondary pulses slightly later \nby the antennae to either side. This is a true phased array radar, able to shape and bend its signals around the curvature of the earth, \nor “over the horizon.” \n\n\nArtist’s Sketch of Freya \n\n\n\nConsequently, the Germans, in spite of some technical shortcomings of their radar operations during the war, were experimenting \nin areas that were quite advanced for the day: \n\na. Broadband radar systems based on \n\nb. Phased array “signal shaping” for \n\nc. Over-the-horizon, or “action at a distance” operation. \n\nAs will be subsequently argued in chapter five, they were combining all these ideas with that of sending pulses of bursts of energy. \nAll of this was, of course, for the long-range guidance of their projected intercontinental rockets. \n\nIn any case, the accuracy of these types of systems had been brought to a high state by the Germans by October of 1943. By that \ntime, the accuracy was such that it was able to guide aircraft at a distance of 105 kilometers, during a bombing run, to release their \nbombs within 600 meters of their target, even though it was not visible to them.- — \n\nHowever, as will be seen in a later chapter, the Germans may have discovered something while operating these sophisticated radar \nunits that indicated they were a door beckoning to a whole new type of physics, one with a far greater promise than mere long-range \nrockets carrying atomic bombs. \n\nThe real question, the one that will now preoccupy us for the remainder of this book, remains: why would the military-industrial- \nnational security complex be so concerned to deflect attention away from Nazi scientific achievements - an effort represented by \nColonel Corso’s The Day After Roswell - even at this late date, unless there is something it still wishes to hide? The answer is \ntwofold. The most important part of the answer lies in what the Germans may have discovered with these radar sets, a part with \nwhich we shall have much to do when we finally turn to examine the exotic type of physics the Nazis may have been developing in \npart two. \n\nFor now we will turn to a less important reason, the reason that, if one pulled on the thread long enough and hard enough, would \ninevitably lead one to ask questions about the “public consumption” history of the race to the moon, the most visible aspect of the \nsurvival of Nazi research projects and their “creative financing” in the post-war world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 . \n\n\n„From Russia mith Lone:“ The Two Space Programs hyppothesis \n\n\n“The Second World War was an air war; the Third World War will be a space war. \n\n\nReichsmarscha.il Hermann Goring, shortly before his suicide, from a letter of October 1946 to Sir Winston ChurchilP— \n\n\n“Control of space means control of the world.... There is something more important than the ultimate weapon. That is the \nultimate position - the position of total control over Earth that lies somewhere in outer space... ” \n\nOJ \n\nPresident (then U. S. Senate Majority Leader) Lyndon Baines Johnson, Speech before the Senate Democratic Caucus, January 7, 1 958.— \n\n\nWhat do celebrated Face-on-Mars expert Richard C. Hoagland, conspiriologist Jim Keith, Apollo program “whistleblowers” \nDavid Percy and Mary Bennett, an anonymous Texas lawyer, famous New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, “occult” author \n“Jan Van Helsing,” and even Wemer Von Braun himself all have in common? All of them believe, in some fashion, that there have \nbeen, for quite some time, two space programs, one for public consumption, and another deeply covert one with its own agenda. \n\nAnd the idea is not confined to books or non-fiction. In the classic James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, a young Sean \nConnery tracks down a plot for world domination by the sinister “independent villain” Ernst Stavro Blohfeld to a kidnapped \neccentric multi-billionaire - played by country singer Jimmy Dean - who lives in a Las Vegas penthouse, and to his secret corporate \nheadquarters somewhere in the Nevada desert. If all this sounds vaguely familiar, hang on. \n\nOnce having infiltrated the secret Nevada installation, Connery-Bond then exchanges brief remarks with a German scientist - Pr. \nDr. Metz is the name of the character in the film - who is working with diamonds for use in a super-laser to be orbited in a satellite in \nspace as the ultimate missile-destroying weapon, thus rendering America’s nuclear arsenal useless. While on this world-saving \nmission, Bond manages to escape the compound through a television sound stage, a set which depicts a lunar landscape, complete \nwith suited “astronauts” going through the slow-motions of a well-scripted lunar landing. These film facts have long led those who \nbelieve that the Apollo lunar landings were hoaxed to maintain that Ian Fleming, creator of the famous British spy character and \nhimself an intelligence agent during the war, was leaking “inside information.” \n\nApparently Ian Fleming was not the only one involved in such “leaks,” for another famous movie, Seven Days in May, this time \nby Rod Serling, celebrated creator of the famous Twilight Zone television series, told the story of an attempted right-wing military \ncoup against a weak and apparently “liberal” President. The coup was centered on a secret military base somewhere in the desert of \nthe American southwest. So real was Serling’s screenplay that the release of the movie was actually delayed after the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy for fears that it might raise too many questions. And that may not have been entirely coincidental, for President \nKennedy had indeed given actual assistance to Serling when he was writing his screenplay. Did Kennedy let Serling know, in so \nmany terms, about Area 51? \n\nAnd, to round out the picture, another famous movie contributed significantly in conspiracy circles to the view of “movies-as- \ndeliberate-leaks”. The movie was Capricorn One. In the movie, three astronauts are placed into a space capsule bound for Mars on \nmankind’s first manned flight to the Red Planet. But, at the last minute, they are secretly taken off the rocket and flown to - you \nguessed it - a secret desert base in the American southwest where, before television cameras and a full sound lot movie mock-up set \nof the Martian surface, the three astronauts then act out their carefully scripted parts of the voyage to and landing on Mars. To round \nout the picture of conspiracy, the three astronauts, having pangs of conscience, decide to expose the whole farce, and orders are \ngiven to hunt them down and ensure the project’s secrecy. Meanwhile, a curious ground member of the mission control crew, who \nhas spotted anomalies in the data that do not square with a mission to Mars, is eliminated. \n\n\nA. The Two Space Program Hypothesis \n\n\nIf anything emerges from these three famous “cult film” classics, it is a theme one encounters quite frequently in some \n“conspiracy” literature, aspects of which are as follows: \n\n1. The Apollo Moon missions, or at least some aspects of them, were a hoax, and the Apollo missions did not happen in exactly \nthe way we were told they happened; \n\n2. As a corollary to this idea, there is the notion that there are two space programs, one for public consumption, and another \nhidden one, being controlled or coordinated by the military-industrial complex; \n\n3. People have been murdered, or at least died under mysterious circumstances, who have attempted to expose this secret \nprogram and public hoax; and finally, if one adds Serling’s plot into this mix, \n\n4. There is some element or aspect of a coup d’etat hovering in the background. \n\nWe shall call these four elements the “Two Space Programs” Hypothesis. And as will be seen below as the main non -fictional \nversions of it are examined, there are indeed unusually cogent arguments that at least some version of the hypothesis may in fact be \ntrue. \n\n\n\n1. The Torbitt Document Version \n\n\nPerhaps the most famous and yet paradoxically least known version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is that of the so- \ncalled “Torbitt” document on the assassination of President Kennedy. Well-known to JFK assassination researchers since its first \nappearance in photocopied “samizdat” form in the 1970s, the document is hardly known at all to the general public, even amongst \nthose inclined to believe that some sort of conspiracy was involved in the assassination. \n\nSuch a response, however, hardly captures the document’s singular importance. Indeed, as well-known “conspiriologist” Kenn \nThomas notes, it is arguably “the pivotal document of JFK assassination research,”— if for no other reason than the sensational \ncontents it contains, for its contents were in turn summarized from New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison’s famous (or \ninfamous) investigation of the case. Its truly remarkable contents are even more explosive considering the fact that in almost no \nversion of the JFK assassination conspiracy that make their rounds every few years when a new book is published on the subject, are \nthe Torbitt Document’s main characters ever mentioned. Indeed, not even Garrison dwelt too long on this particular aspect that his \nown investigators discovered, and Oliver Stone ignored this aspect of the story completely in his celebrated movie on the Garrison \ninvestigation, JFK. Nonetheless, the Committee on Assassinations in the 1970s took it seriously enough to entirely prohibit \ndiscussion or even mention of any possible Nazi connection with the assassination. \n\nBut what could have been so sensational about a single pseudonymously authored “samizdat” manuscript privately circulated in \nassassination conspiracy circles? Kenn Thomas once again summarizes some of its highly unusual contents: \n\nIt makes connections to such then-unknown governmental spy agencies as Defense Industrial Security Command and Division \nFive of the FBI; it suggests that a former prime minister of Hungary was the infamous “umbrella man” seen in the Zapruder \nfilm; it introduces to the assassination lore such personalities as Fred Crisman (spelled Chrismon” by Torbitt) as one of the \nrailroad tramps behind the grassy knoll. — \n\nJust in case the reader does not know who these individuals are, nor why they should be significant, a brief word is necessary. The \nformer Prime Minister of Hungary referred to is Ferenc Nagy, a man who was nothing less than a puppet of the Nazis during World \nWar Two. What he should be doing on the grassy knoll clearly signaling someone by closing his umbrella just as President \nKennedy’s limousine is driving by, no one knows. And as if that were not strange enough, the Crisman referred to is none other than \nFred Chrisman, well known for his involvement in the infamous Maury Island UFO affair in 1947 in Seattle-Tacoma, Washington. - \nJust what this oddball cast of characters should have to do with the Kennedy assassination not even the Torbitt document pretends \nto know, as no explanations or possible motivations are offered. But one can imagine the perplexity of District Attorney Garrison \nwhen he learned of Chrisman’s odd background prior to serving a subpoena on him! \n\nIn any case, a clue to it all is perhaps afforded by the reference to the “Defense Industrial Security Command”. What was this \nentity? Here, it is best to cite the Torbitt document itself, rather than Thomas’ introduction: \n\nThe killing of President Kennedy was planned and supervised by Division Five of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a \nrelatively small department within the FBI whose usual duties are espionage and counter-espionage activities. \n\nActually, Division Five acted dually with the Defense Intelligence Agency which was acting on behalf of the Joints Chiefs \nof Staff (sic) in the Pentagon. Directly under the two-pronged leadership of Division Five and the DIA was the Control Group, \ntheir highly secret police agency - the Defense Industrial Security Command. The Defense Industrial Security Command has \nalways been kept secret because it acts, in addition to its two official control organizations, on behalf of NASA, the Atomic \nEnergy Commission, U.S. Information Agency, and the arms, equipment, ammunition, munitions and related miscellaneous \nsupply manufacturing corporations contracting with NASA, the AEC, USIA, and the Pentagon.... \n\nThe Defense Industrial Security Command had its beginnings when J. Edgar Hoover in the early 1930’s organized the police \nforce of the Tennessee Valley Authority at the request of David Lilienthal. The police force covered the entire TVA from \nKnoxville, Tennessee through Huntsville and Florence, Alabama and into Kentucky and back through the eastern portion of \nTennessee into southern Kentucky. This was one of the first federal agencies with a separate police force. This force grew and \nLilienthal took it forward to cover the Atomic Energy Commission, thus tying it into the army intelligence service. \n\n....A Swiss corporation, Perm index, was used to head five front organizations responsible for furnishing personnel and \nsupervisors to carry out assigned duties (in the assassination). \n\nThe five groups under Permindex and their supervisors were: \n\n1. The Czarist Russian, eastern European and Middle East exile organization called SOLIDARISTS, (sic) headed by \nFerenc Nagy, ex-Hungarian premier, and John DeMenil, Russian exile from Houston, Texas, a close friend and \n\n\nsupporter of Lyndon Johnson for over thirty years. \n\n2. A section of the AMERICAN COUNCIL OF CHRISTIAN CHURCHES headed by H.L. Hunt of Dallas, Texas. \n\n3. A Cuban exile group called FREE CUBA COMMITTEE headed by Carlos Prio Socarras, ex-Cuban president. \n\n4. An organization of United States, Caribbean, and Havana, Cuba gamblers called the Syndicate.... This group worked \nclosely with a Mafia family headed by Joe Bonanno. \n\n5. The SECURITY DIVISION of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) headed by Wemer Von \nBraun, head of the German Nazi rocket program from 1932 through 1945.— Headquarters for this group was the \nDEFENSE INDUSTRIAL SECURITY COMMAND at Muscle Shoals Redstone Arsenal in Alabama and on East \nBroad Street in Columbus, Ohio.— \n\n\nThese are sensational allegations, indeed, so much so that one might be tempted to dismiss the document entirely, were it not for the \nfact that it is but a summary of the more unusual aspects of the Garrison investigation. \n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to dismiss the document out of hand, for careful examination of the components of the conspiracy \n- in its version of the event - reveal that with but one or two exceptions, it is the standard intelligence-military industrial complex-in- \ncahoots-with-the-Mafia scenario that are common themes among more popular versions of the conspiracy.— \n\nBut added to this there are a number of new players: \n\n1. H.L. Hunt and an organization that is basically connected to fundamentalist-evangelical revivalist “Protestantism,” in other \nwords, big oil masking behind a missionary organization;— \n\n2. A group of Eastern European exiles of right-wing political complexion, “headed by Ferenc Nagy.” \n\nLet us pause a moment to consider these new players on the scene. \n\nMost JFK conspiracy literature does mention Lee Harvey Oswald’s and Marina Oswald’s connection to the Russian and White \nRussian emigre community in Dallas, and in turn the connections of that community to big oil. Nonetheless, not much is made of this \nconnection. It is as if researchers do not really know what to make of it. About all that one typically encounters is the fact that the \nOswalds’ landlord, Ruth Paine, was involved in this community, and that her husband, Michael, worked for Bell Aerospace, the \nsame Bell Aerospace that employed General Walter Domberger, military head of Hitler’s V-2 project in conjunction with Wemer \nVon Braun. But here most assassination researchers stop, not really noticing that the Nazi connections would multiply like rabbits, if \none cared to look for them, for the fact of the matter is, the various societies, organizations, and groups of this Eastern European \nemigre community were but the North American connections - the leftovers, so to speak - of the vast network of German military \nintelligence that operated on and behind the Russian front throughout World War Two. \n\nThis military intelligence group was called Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East) and was headed by General Reinhard \nGehlen. We shall have much more to say both about this intelligence network and its commanding general later. For now, however, \nit is to be noted that the Torbitt document, by naming Ferenc Nagy as “head” of this emigre community, is perhaps speaking \nsymbolically, pointing the finger to a very hidden Nazi presence in the assassination. We are now in a position to examine the last \nnew player in the assassination that the document mentions: \n\n3. NASA security, headed by Von Braun, working inside the Defense Industrial Security Command (D.I.S.C.!) at Redstone \nArsenal in Alabama. \n\nIn other words, the third new player in the assassination is the space program, and the Torbitt Document further implies that it is \nan aspect of the space program that is not only relatively hidden from the general public, but also which is under the direct control of \nWemer Von Braun, yet another Nazi connection. \n\nBut what of the “Permindex Corporation” in Switzerland, the entity allegedly coordinating all this malfeasance for the FBI and \nDIA? Who was involved with it? What were its purposes? A glance at its Board of Directors indicates why it attracted the attention \nof District Attorney Garrison, for among those on its board were, of course, Clay Shaw, the man Garrison actually indicted for \nconspiracy to murder the president. But others included an Italian Fascist who had married into the family of Hjalmar Schacht,— \nHitler’s president of the Reichsbank and finance minister, and interestingly enough, also father-in-law to Hitler’s favorite SS \ncommando, Otto Skorzeny. But these men hardly exhaust the unusual characters. There was an uncle to Egyptian King Farouk,— \nthe Italian minister of agriculture under Mussolini’s government, and yet another Hungarian ex-Nazi besides Ferenc Nagy, H. \nSimonfay.— \n\nAs if that were not enough, the Torbitt Document then goes on to provide a rather thorough list of Permindex’s principal financial \nbacking, a list that reads like a veritable who’s who of conspiracies and scandals that had not yet even happened: \n\n\nThe principal financiers of Permindex were a number of U.S. oil companies, H. L. Hunt of Dallas, Clint Murchison of Dallas, \nJohn DeMenil, Solidarist director of Houston, John Connally as executor of the Sid Richardson estate, Haliburton Oil Co., \nSenator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma, Troy Post of Dallas, Lloyd Cobb of New Orleans, Dr. Oechner of New Orleans, George \nand Herman Brown of Brown and Root, Houston, Attorney Roy M. Cohn, Chairman of the Board for Lionel Corporation, \n\nNew York City, Schlemley Industries of New York City, Walter Domberger, ex-Nazi general and his company, Bell \nAerospace, Pan American World Airways and its subsidiary, Intercontinental Hotel Corporation... \n\nand last but by no means least \n\n...NASA contractors directed by the Defense Industrial Security Command.— \n\nIn reading this bizarre list, one cannot help but think of the scandals-to-come, the Hunts and their attempt to comer the silver market \nand create a silver-backed currency for Texas(H. L. Hunt), the numerous allegations of conspiracy involved in the death of Karen \nSilkwood and her exposure of Kerr-McGee(Senator Robert Kerr of Oklahoma), current allegations that the real motivation for war \nwith Iraq was oil (Haliburton). \n\nAnd that’s not all. Even Senator Joseph McCarthy’s ghost hovers over the list of Permindex characters in the form of his legal \ncouncil Roy Cohn. As if that were not enough, one of the banks through which Permindex often allegedly worked or channeled \nfunds was the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro of Italy, a bank linked to many other shady scandals, including that of the notorious \nBank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI scandal. And, at the end of this list, as if to highlight its importance, is NASA \nand its contractors, who, notes the Torbitt Document, “are directed by the Defense Industrial Security Command,” which is headed \nby Wemer Von Braun. \n\nBut directed to do what? Why would Wemer Von Braun possibly be involved in such an affair? \n\nThe answer, perhaps, lies in the Torbitt Document’s stated purposes of the Permindex Corporation: \n\n1. To fund and direct assassinations of European, Mid-East and world leaders considered threats to the Western World and to \npetroleum interests of the backers. \n\n2. To furnish couriers, agents, and management in transporting, depositing and re-channeling funds through Swiss banks for \nLas Vegas, Miami, Havana and international gambling syndicate. \n\n3. To co-ordinate the espionage activities of the Solidarists and Division Five of the FBI with groups in sympathy with their \nobjectives and to receive and channel funds and arms from the financiers to the action groups. \n\n4. To build, acquire and operate hotels and gambling casinos in the Caribbean, Italy and at other tourist areas.— \n\nPermindex, in other words, was the “Murder Incorporated” referred to by subsequent American Presidents. \n\nBut what does all this mean? What do these “purposes” indicate about the real nature of Permindex and its “backers”? Note first \nof all the purpose of eliminating, by assassination, any threat to the “petroleum interests of the backers.” In other words, big oil once \nagain. Note also, that any alternative technology such as those represented by cold fusion, or “zero point energy” devices, would \nrepresent precisely such a threat. So one may safely assume that one is to take “the protection of the oil interests” in the widest \npossible sense, as not only eliminating foreign governments or parties that would threaten these interests’ overseas investments, but \nalso the elimination of anyone presuming to a develop a technology not dependent on oil for energy. \n\nPoints two and three, however, point to something even deeper, and that is not only a hidden intelligence connection - a group \noperating within or only in conjunction with established and official agencies of the U.S. Federal government - but also a means for \nthe independent financing of such groups and means of laundering the money to do it: casinos, ideal vehicles for laundering vast \namounts of money quickly. This would explain the Mafia connection and involvement: it was at a “low” level of the conspiracy, the \nlevel necessary only for ensuring easy access and flow of dirty money to finance these projects. \n\nAll this makes a very strange context in which to view the last component of Permindex’s backers, “NASA contractors directed \nby the Defense Industrial Security Command.” What possible connection could NASA’s DISC under the direction of Von Braun \nhave to do with this? One answer, perhaps, lies in the implied suggestion that Permindex may have conducted assassinations to \nprotect more than just the oil industry. \n\nThe Torbitt Document later provides an indicator of just who might have really been pulling the strings in the “corporation” when \nit stated “Permindex in Switzerland, basically a NATO intelligence front using the remnants of Adolph Hitler’s intelligence units in \nWest Germany and also, the intelligence unit of the Solidarists headquarters in Munich, Germany.”— Munich was, of course, also \nGeneral Reinhard Gehlen’s personal headquarters for his Gehlenorg,— the network of spies and “Solidarists” he continued to run \nboth behind the Iron Curtain and elsewhere, ostensibly for the Central Intelligence Agency and the West German \nBundesnachrichtendienst. The Gehlenorg and its many connections were even implicated in the Generals’ Plot, the assassination \n\n\nattempt on French President Charles DeGaulle, an attempt DeGaulle’s Surete quickly and efficiently traced and eliminated.— \n\nBut why, again, would Von Braun be involved in such a conspiracy? While the Torbitt Document ultimately does not provide \nmuch of an answer to this question, it does hint at an answer that, shorn of its Nazi associations, will become a standard theme in \nsome conspiracy views on the assassination, most notably that of Oliver Stone in his famous movie on the Garrison investigation, \nJFK. The Torbitt Document raises the prospect of the immense profits to be made from war, namely, the war in Vietnam: \n\nThe Nazi scientists are on management level also in the munitions and aerospace industry. Walter Domberger. the Nazi general, \nleft the space agency in the 1950’s to become a high official in Bell Aerospace Corporation and he was followed by over thirty \nof the Nazi scientists to control level in the corporations manufacturing munitions and aerospace material. This still left well \nover sixty of the scientists at command level in NASA.— \n\nOf course, in the 1950s the war in Vietnam was ending its French phase and only entering the American one, but in any case, the \nmotive is clearly implied: there were big profits to be made in war. \n\nMoreover, the positioning of these Paperclip Project Nazis in key American defense industries may be an indicator of something \nfar different taking place: the extension of influence by means of interlocking personnel in many management positions. This may \neasily be understood by recalling a method noted by many other writers on conspiracy, namely, that the method whereby power was \nconcentrated in fewer and fewer hands by such financial dynasties as Rockefeller, Morgan, Warburg, or Rothschild, was simply to \ninsist, as part of a condition of receiving a loan or grant from their institutions, that those institutions themselves were allowed to seat \na representative on the loan recipient’s governing board. This was usually done by collateralizing the loan with stock in the company \nreceiving the loan. \n\nFlere, a similar pattern is at least implied: these Nazi scientists may have been acting to extend their own independent network of \npower and influence throughout the American military-industrial complex by being seated in senior management positions in return \nfor their expertise. We shall present evidence later that will corroborate this. In any case, viewed against the backdrop of General \nGehlen’s effective preservation of his spy network and its grafting and penetration into post-war American intelligence, the picture \nthat now emerges from the Torbitt document is chilling in its potentialities. \n\nEach of the Nazi connections alluded to in the Torbitt document indicate influential Nazi presence not only in America’s space \nprogram, but moreover, strongly hint of Nazi influence in the awarding of contracts for the space program, Nazi influence in control \nof the security of the space program, Nazi influence in the intelligence organs of America and the West, Nazi influence in the \ndefense and aerospace industries, and Nazi influence lurking in the background of Permindex, “Murder Incorporated.” Indeed, Von \nBraun himself may be viewed as the best exemplar of the type of smiling, glad-handing “networking” that make such influence \npossible, for shortly after arriving in the United States, he made a point of befriending none other than J. Edgar Hoover, and the then \nSenator Lyndon Johnson. — And who was one of the individuals who helped expedite Von Braun’s and Domberger’s repatriation \nto the United States? None other than Clay Shaw, the man Garrison would ultimately indict for conspiracy to murder President \nKennedy.— The transfer of the Nazi Project Paperclip scientists was also aided by none other than General Gehlen.— \n\nAll we know about the pseudonymous William Torbitt was that he was a prominent attorney in South Texas politics in the 1960s \nand 1970s.— This makes the Torbitt Document’s revelations all the more sensational. While some might be inclined to dismiss its \nmany claims out of hand, a picture does emerge of quietly exercised Nazi influence behind the scenes, an influence working in \nconjunction with other interests - big oil, technology suppression, Mafia, gambling and money laundering, aerospace and defense - \nand working effectively at that. \n\nMoreover, the Torbitt Document suggests, albeit only slightly and only on very careful reading, that there is some hidden aspect to \nAmerica’s space program, a hidden aspect represented by the mysterious Defense Industrial Security Command and its head, Wemer \nVon Braun. It suggests that this was one of the many motivations represented by the various groups that whose interests coalesced in \nthe murder of the President. But beyond that, it does not go. And this leaves a very disturbing question hovering in the air: \n\nIf there was some hidden aspect to the space program, and if its principals had some motivation for participating in the murder of \nthe President, what was it? What did this hidden aspect of the space program have to gain? Or, alternatively, what about President \nKennedy threatened it; what did it have to protect? Or was it some combination of both? To answer these questions requires an \nexamination of some of the other versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, even, as we shall see, the absurd ones. \n\n\n2. The False Planetary Geology, Climate, and Archaeology Versions: \n\n\na. The Absurdist Versions \n\n\nOne may summarize the “absurdist” versions of the Two Space Programs very easily: \n\nThe Moon has an atmosphere and water, and even vegetation. \n\nVenus, beneath its canopy of clouds, is not the carbon dioxide pressure-cooker and barren desert greenhouse we’ve been told, but \nrather, a temperate planet of rich vegetation, a veritable paradise. And, if one believes Adamski - and this author most decidedly does \nnot - it is home to a wonderful race of peaceful, blondehaired, blue-eyed, human space brothers who come in peace to bring earth- \nbound humanity a message of hope. \n\nAnd Mars really does have canals, and, thankfully, isn’t planning an invasion of Earth anytime soon. \n\nBut what has this to do with a hidden and public space program? \n\nVery simple: according to the absurdist version the governments of the world that have space programs have hidden the truth \nabout the planets of our solar system, carefully doctoring pictures to edit out any evidence that shows any of the above! \n\n\nb. A Scientifically and Politically Plausible Version: The Hoagland Model \n\n\nA much more serious model, and much more plausible one, has been argued in various ways over the years by Richard C \nHoagland, best known for his association with the ongoing investigations of the anomalous Martian surface features in the Cydonia \nregion of Mars, features he believes strongly suggest an artificial origin. \n\nWhile an extended presentation of Hoagland’s views is not possible here - after all they have evolved over many years of \ncontinual research, requiring a scholarly study in their own right - there are certain stable features that one may point to as \nsummarizing some aspects of his version: \n\n1. The Brookings Report: Immediately after its formation, NASA commissioned a study of the possible impact of human \ncontact with an extraterrestrial civilization in its explorations of the solar system, or alternatively, with human discovery of \nany artifacts of such a civilization. As Hoagland has pointed out on more than one occasion, the Brookings report indicated \nthat there might be severe cultural implications and repercussions of such discoveries or events. Thus, Hoagland argues, the \ngovernment may have adopted the policy, based on the Brookings recommendations, of concealing such discoveries. \n\n2. In this context, one way of concealment is the alteration of photographic or other scientific data that indicates the presence of \nsuch contact or civilization artifact. Another method is the outright dismissal of evidence after-the-fact, such as NASA’s post- \nViking dismissal of the Face on Mars as nothing but a “trick of light and shadow.” These and other tactics were subsequently \nemployed by NASA down to the present whenever anomalous findings are returned by space probes. \n\n3. A third component of Hoagland’s view is that there is a “hidden space program”, or better, group within NASA, exercising \ninfluence in an esoteric or occult direction over the scheduling, naming, and symbolism attached to missions. In support of \nthis allegation, Hoagland has noted the high predominance of Masons in the astronaut corps, particularly in the formative \ndays of NASA during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. Additionally, Hoagland has also maintained that many \nmissions are designed to align with significant celestial (astrological) correlations, as if space missions were deliberate acts in \na vast system of ritual magic being done on a planetary scale via the space program itself. \n\n4. The final and most important component in Hoagland’s model is that the surface features of Cydonia on Mars encode a lost \n“hyperdimensional physics,” a physics Hoagland sees in evidence in the planetary upwellings of energy at the “tetrahedral \nlatitude” of 19.5 north or south degrees on every celestial body in the solar system. \n\nWhile such assertions may sound fantastic, the fact that they are made by someone of Hoagland’s stature is significant, and, as we \nshall see below, the more one digs beneath the surface of various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, and the more \ndetails one uncovers, Hoagland’s version seems to pale into mundane normalcy by comparison. \n\n\n\n3. The “Alternative Three” Version \n\n\nAmong the many versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, none is more bizarre nor more famous than the Alternative 3 \nversion. \n\nAlternative 3 was a “documentary” produced for the British science series Science Report, which aired on Anglia television in the \n1970s. Originally scheduled to air on April 1, 1977, the broadcast was delayed and did not air until June, though in the production \ncredits April 1 is listed as the date. The “documentary” was one hour long, and makes interesting viewing.— Ostensibly the \n“documentary” begins by investigating the so-called “brain drain” that was affecting Great Britain during the 1970s, as many of her \ntop scientists and engineers left the country for more prosperous and promising positions overseas, most notably in Canada and the \nUnited States, and to a lesser extent Australia and New Zealand. Moving quickly, the documentary “uncovers” the cases of three \nscientists who simply were never heard from again, despite attempts of their “families” to contact them. Finally, one scientist died in \na mysterious automobile accident, allegedly after placing a telephone call from a remote country phone booth to a journalist friend of \nhis, to whom he had sent a computer memory tape. \n\nOn the tape, when it was finally “decoded” by the indefatigable investigative journalists of Anglia Television, was a video \nrecording of an alleged joint Russian-American Mars landing in 1962, complete with video recording of sub-surface life burrowing a \nfurrow on the ground to the wild and thrilled cheers of the Russian and American ground control crews in the background! \n\nWith missing scientists and engineers, a mysteriously dead scientist, and a computer tape of an alleged Mars landing, the \njournalists leam of a hidden, secret joint space program being conducted by the Americans and Russians, a component of which was \nto persuade the best and brightest of the world’s scientists to participate in the gradual, and very secret, colonization of the Moon and \nMars. The purpose of this colonization? The world’s elite had concluded that the planet was being destroyed by humanity, and that \noverpopulation had passed the point of no return, and that life on Earth was doomed. Three alternatives were discussed to save the \nsituation. The first was to explode nuclear warheads in the atmosphere, in an attempt to create a “hole” which would bleed off the \npollution. The second was to build vast underground installations in which humanity could survive when the surface became \nunviable. And the third, Alternative 3, was to seek new planetary homes on the Moon and Mars. \n\nThe secret space program was thus a modem-day Noah’s Ark, and the most heinous crimes were being perpetrated to ensure the \nsuccess of Alternative 3. There, more or less, is where the “documentary” ended. \n\nBut the story did not end. In fact, the network was flooded with calls from thousands of people who professed their belief in the \nwhole wild scenario, and who in some cases added their own stories of encounters with the “hidden masters” of the project. \n\nThe problem was, the whole program was a complete hoax, an elaborate April Fools’ Day joke, intended as such by the \nproducers and authors of the teleplay, David Ambrose and Christopher Miles,— a fact that would have been evident from careful \nexamination of the closing credits, with its very clearly stated date, and long list of cast which included professional actors.— The \nstory would not die, however, and was soon followed by a badly-written book of the same title, about which more in a moment. \n\nTo one Canadian inquiring about the truth of the “documentary,” co-author and producer Christopher Miles stated: \n\n“The idea for the film and subsequently the book, was something that David (Ambrose) and I dreamed up over a lunch together \nin London, as I was getting rather tired of the docu-drama on television and wanted to prove how easy it is to lead the general \npublic up the proverbial garden path! I am sorry that you were one of them and if you look at the film or read the book, you will \nrealize that there are hints of its unauthenticity all the way down the line. \n\nOf course it has a sprinkling of fact in it, but the basic show is a complete hoax and if you think a bit more yourself, you \nwould realize this was the case.” \n\nIn an interview, however, Miles commented in a somewhat more mysterious fashion, saying, “Let’s say that all the facts in \nthe show were true and all the lies untrue.”— \n\nThe documentary’s inconsistent acting is mirrored in the book’s incongruous slurry of wildly unconnected “data” all served up as \n“corroboration” of the secret space program and its nefarious activities: \n\nThe death of fifteen wild ponies in Dartmoor, England, is mentioned, an episode reminiscent of the cattle mutilations prevalent \nin the U.S. beginning in the mid-60s. Factual CIA MKULTRA mind control atrocities are also mulled over, but not in \nparticular detail, and with no credible link to Alternative 3. Along the way instances of Russian-American cooperation in space \nare described, and we are offered accounts of the plights of several amnesia victims, but none of this has much to do with the \ncore of the Alternative 3 thesis.— \n\n\nAt the end of it all - a book and a “documentary” - what does one make of Alternative 31 Jim Keith summarizes the whole episode \nthis way: \n\nIn summary, Alternative 3 is a teleplay and a book which utterly lack substantiation, and the book in particular is written in a \nstyle identical to the Weekly World News of “Two-Headed Space Alien Gives Birth to Elvis’ Lovechild” fame. What propels \nAlternative 3 along in the manner of a 1940s Amazing Stories extravaganza set in the vicinity of Fleet Street are the “secret \ndocuments,” the interviews with persons who do not exist and, more than that, the word of the authors who, while repeatedly \nmaintaining “We are only interested in facts,” write a television show and book loaded with as many questionable conclusions \nas the latest Brad Steiger UFO masterpiece. \n\nAll the references to flights to Mars, “batch consignments” and so forth are found in the poorly rendered and unbelievable \n“secret transcripts” or created from thin Martian air by the authors.— \n\nBut, as Keith himself notes, one comes away from viewing the “documentary” and/or reading the book with an uneasy feeling, \nnotwithstanding their clear and evident nature as hoaxes, and that uneasy feeling is that Alternative 3 and its various themes are quite \nclose to the truth, that something like the odd goings on in the “documentary” actually are occurring. \n\nIn fact, Feslie Watkins, who co-authored the book version with the “documentary’s” producers for Penguin Books, wrote a \nresearcher who had contacted the Penguin editor, that the book was “based on fact, but uses that fact as a launchpad for a high dive \ninto fiction.” And a little later in his letter, Watkins recounts the unusual events that befell him after the book version was published \nand in circulation: “For some time after Alternative 3 was originally published, I have reason to suppose that my home telephone was \nbeing tapped and my contacts who were experienced in such matters were convinced that certain intelligence agencies considered \nthat I probably knew too much. So, summing up, the book is fiction based on fact. But I now feel that I inadvertently got very close \nto a secret truth. But if Watkins, Miles, and Ambrose had come too close to “a secret truth” that would call forth electronic \nwiretapping in response, what exactly in the crazy quilt-work of the Alternative 3 universe was it? \n\nThe universe of Alternative 3 is clear enough: there is a secret space program involving both Russians and Americans in \ncooperation, being controlled by some entity that transcends their governments and uses them for its own ends, which is the secret \ncolonization of the Moon and Mars. To this end, it persuades or kidnaps scientists, and “commoners” for manual labor. Those it \ncannot “persuade” or who threaten to expose the project, are murdered. So one has the following elements: \n\n1. Several missing scientists, in great numbers; \n\n2. Murdered scientists; \n\n3. Several missing “common” people; \n\n4. A secret space program existing inside of, or parallel to, the public programs in Russia and America; \n\n5. Colonies on the Moon and/or Mars; and finally, \n\n6. Some entity coordinating all the above. \n\nConspiracy researcher Jim Keith investigated these aspects of the case, and came to a rather provocative conclusion, a conclusion so \nprovocative, in fact, that he seldom states it directly, though much of his book, Mind Control and UFOs: Casebook on Alternative 3, \nimplies this conclusion simply by virtue of the amount of time he spends exploring it. \n\nWe begin with point number 2 above: the deaths of scientists. Keith, like many other authors, noted the very strange fact that \nmany European scientists, physicists, and engineers who were involved with, or otherwise might have something to contribute to \nPresident Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative, seemed to have unusually high suicide or “death-by-mysterious- \ncircumstances” rates. And oddly, most of these scientists were from Western Europe. Proportionally fewer Americans, Canadians or \nAustralians were involved in the unusual deaths. \n\nAmong those that Keith lists were: Keith Bowden, supercomputer expert; Roger Hill, a designer for Marconi Defense Systems \n(who allegedly killed himself by shotgun blast); Jonathan Walsh, digital communications expert for Marconi’s parent firm, GEC; \nKarl-Heinz Beckurts, director of research for Germany’s Siemens Company and his driver; and, notes Keith, “an SDI contractor \nallegedly linked to activities of Otto Skorzeny’s Nazi International;” Vimal Dajibhai, an expert in computer guidance systems; \nGerrold von Braunmuhl, a high advisor to West Germany’s Defense Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher; Ashad Shariff, another \nMarconi employee; a Swedish professor, Svante Oden; an Italian electronics executive, Fando Conti; Aytar Singh-Gida, an SDI \ntechnology expert; Richard Pugh, British Defense Ministry contracts worker; John Brittan, computer expert; Swedish arms inspector \nCal Frederik Algernon...and on and on Keith’s list goes.— \n\nFike the “mysterious deaths” of key witnesses and personnel that followed the assassination of President Kennedy, rather too \nmany scientists and engineers were dying in too many suspicious ways for the whole episode to be entirely coincidental. Keith \nobserves that: \n\n\n\nIn July of 1986, Kurt Rebmann, Germany’s Federal Prosecutor, told the New York Times that he believed the attacks were part \nof a “coordinated offensive” against the West and the SDI program. \n\nSo, who killed the Star Wars scientists? In at least two of the cases, those of Beckurts and von Braunmuhl, the Marxist Red \nArmy Faction (RAF) claimed responsibility. In Italy a note was found at the location of Griogieri’s murder, stating that he “was \nstruck down exclusively for his responsibility exercised following the Italian adhesion to the Star Wars project.” And attributing \nthe murder to the Italian Red Brigades. Of course, notes can easily be faked, and the fact that responsibility was claimed in only \nthree cases is odd if two groups performed all the murders. — \n\nOne explanation, the obvious one, is that “it was apparent to the Kremlin that SDI, far from bring the defensive program that it was \ntouted as by Ronald Reagan, had an awesome offensive capability.”— This much is true, as we shall see in part two.— But in any \ncase, Keith’s conclusion is rational: the most obvious perpetrators of the strange deaths were the Soviets, who hoped to dissuade the \nWest from deploying SDI. \n\nBut according to Keith, there was likewise another possibility: “It has also occurred to me that if there is in fact a secret flying disk \ntechnology on this planet, withheld for its surprise strike capability from some unknown quarter, then SDI might have been seen as a \ntechnology capable of pinpointing and shooting down such craft.”— That is, if there was an “independent group” perfecting such \nadvanced craft, then that group, too, would view SDI as a threat and seek to derail it, or, conversely, seek to acquire and deploy its \ntechnologies while denying them to its enemies. \n\nIt is this possibility that informs the bulk of Keith’s book. Tracing the possibilities to a pre-war network of American and Nazi \nbusiness contacts, he quickly comes to one locus of possibilities: the “surrender” of Germany’s Foreign Annies East (Fremde Heere \nOst) section of military intelligence to the OSS, a deal that was negotiated between General Reinhard Gehlen and OSS station chief \nin Zurich, Allen Dulles, later chief of the CIA and a member of the Wanen Commission. But the “surrender” was only apparent, as \nmany have pointed out. Keith’s summary is apt: \n\nFor reasons that will hopefully become apparent, I begin the search for Alternative 3 at what might appear to be an arbitrary \nmoment in history: with men, most of whom died a long time ago. As we trace the actions and connections of these men, the \nconspiratorial web will radiate outward, and perhaps begin to take on a definite and ominous pattern. \n\nThe study is taken up shortly after the collapse of the Third Reich, when General Reinhard Gehlen, Nazi spymaster and \nKnight of Malta-to-be began negotiations with Allen Dulles and the American OSS (Office of Strategic Services). Using Nazi \nintelligence networks as a hole card to provide for his own survival and the survival of his huge spy network, Gehlen made a \nseparate peace with Dulles, resulting in the clean grafting of Nazi spy apparatus to the American clandestine services. This was \nthe birth of the CIA and part of a nexus of betrayal that continues to this day.— \n\nIndeed, as many others have pointed out, at the inception of the CIA, the agency’s “Soviet desk” for all intents and purposes \nconsisted almost entirely and exclusively of this Nazi spy network.— Gehlen’s own words recalling this bargain are clinically \nchilling: \n\nI remember the terms of the agreement well... \n\n1. A clandestine German intelligence organization was to be set up, using the existing potential to continue information \ngathering in the East just as we had been doing before. The basis for this was our common interest in a defense against \ncommunism. \n\n2. This German organization was to work not “for” or “under” the Americans, but “jointly ” with the Americans. \n\n3. The organization would operate exclusively under German leadership, which would receive its directives and \nassignments from the Americans until a new government was established in Germany. \n\n4. The organization was to be financed by the Americans with funds which were not to be part of the occupation costs, \nand in return the organization would supply all its intelligence reports to the Americans. \n\n5. As soon as a sovereign German government was established, the government should decide whether the organization \nshould continue to function or not, but that until such time the care and control (later referred to as “the trusteeship”) of \nthe organization would remain in American hands. \n\n6. Should the organization at any time find itself in a position where the American and German interests diverged, it was \naccepted that the organization would consider the interests of Germany first.— \n\n\nIn other words, one whole department of the American Federal government - indeed, one of its most sensitive departments - was \n\n\nbeing run by agents of the Third Reich in a classic Trojan Horse operation !— With the thousands of agents in Gehlen’s \n“Organization,” and its extensive network of “emigre exile” groups and fronts, historian Carl Oglseby noted that the Gehlenorg \n“substantially pre-empted the CIA’s civilian character before it was ever bom...Thus, whatever the CIA was from the standpoint of \nlaw, it remained from the standpoint of practical intelligence collection a front for a house of Nazi spies. ” — \n\nThe importance of these observations cannot be pondered too long, for as many other researchers and commentators have noted, \nthere appears to be a “rogue element” operating somewhere inside the U.S. Federal government and inside its intelligence \ncommunity. Keith’s observations, and similar ones made by others who have researched the incredible bargain struck between Allen \nDulles and General Gehlen, give a historical background and foundation to these fears: There not only is a rogue element within the \nAmerican intelligence community, but it has been there since the end of World War Two. And it was Nazi in its personnel, aims, and \nmethods. \n\nMoreover, as Keith also points out, the Dulles family itself had long business associations with Germany.— And there was an \nideological connection: \n\nWith man, as with every other form of life, there is this same tendency for the birth rate to far exceed the death rate, with the \ninevitable result of an overcrowded population in which some must be eliminated. Who those eliminated are depends upon who \nare weakest and who are strongest in the competition which necessarily ensues. — \n\nIf that sounds vaguely like an anti-Jewish rant of Hitler at a Nuremburg party rally, think again. The words are those of Allen Dulles’ \nbrother, John Foster Dulles, who would later become the American Secretary of State under President Dwight Eisenhower. \n\nIn any case, Gehlen’s bargain with Dulles was but one aspect of the creation of a vast post-war “Nazi International,” an \norganization with massive amounts of money, and, as has been seen, its own intelligence network. \n\nMaintaining close ties to each other and other escaped Nazis, this network evolved into what has been termed the Nazi \nInternational, run by Otto Skorzeny and headquartered in Madrid. The Nazi International would be key in the establishment of \nworldwide arms, terrorist, and drug trafficking networks, although these crimes pale in comparison with the subversion of \nAmerican intelligence, in collaboration with Allen Dulles, the result of which may be said to have been the creation of the Cold \nWar and the continuing destruction of democracy in America.— \n\nSkorzeny most likely was a front man for other more high-ranking Nazis, since he was the son-in-law to former Reichsbank \npresident Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht. \n\nBut if Nazi penetration of America’s post-war intelligence and national security apparatus was a Trojan Horse operation under the \nbanner of a “united front against Communism”, what of the dispersal of Nazi scientists and technology? Could the notorious \nOperation Paperclip - America’s secret post-war program to recruit top Nazi scientists and engineers - have also been viewed, at least \non the German side, as a similar operation? \n\nWhile the evidence is scanty, it is nonetheless provocative. It begins with America’s High Commissioner in Germany in the \nimmediate post-war period: John J. McCloy. When Wemer Von Braun refused to work for the American space program without his \nformer army boss, General Walter Domberger - who had in the meantime been sentenced by the war crimes tribunals to be hung - it \nwas McCloy who stepped in and granted Domberger a full pardon. — In fact, McCloy pardoned over seventy thousand Nazis \naccused of war crimes.— Perhaps this is not surprising, since McCloy was a “lawyer in the employ of I.G. Farben” after World War \nOne, and had shared a box with Hitler himself during the 1936 Berlin Olympic games.— And last, but not least, McCloy, like Allen \nDulles, also served on the Warren Commission. \n\nOnce in the U.S., the Nazi scientists were, of course, watched closely....but not, it seems, too closely. As Keith notes, “Walter \nJessel, an interrogator of the German rocket scientists for the army, claimed that there was a conspiracy between von Braun, \nDomberger, and Domberger’s chief of staff to withhold information from U.S. officers.”— Given the fact that Von Braun’s rockets \nsuccessfully became the backbone of America’s space program, up to and including the Apollo moon rockets, as well as became the \nbackbone for America’s intercontinental ballistic missiles, an important question thus occurs: what possibly could Von Braun and \nDomberger have been withholding? \n\nThey may have been withholding technical information, since this was not an isolated instance. As the following incident \nindicates, three other German scientists brought to the USA \n\nwere found to have illegal mail drops in El Paso, Texas, where they received money and coded messages from foreign sources. \nOther instances of Nazi scientists receiving money from unknown sources were not investigated by the military, including an \ninstance when one third of the German Paperclip group simultaneously bought expensive cars that they were reportedly unable \n\n\nto afford on their salaries. There were also repeated suspicions that rockets were being sabotaged, and that components were \nmissing from recovered missiles.— \n\nIf so, then the Gehlenorg offered the perfect means to spirit any developed technology out of America and into “the right hands”. \nKeith concludes his scenario with the following observations: \n\nThe controlling reins of German technologies such as rockets, advanced aircraft, and atomics were never fully surrendered; \ninner circle control, through knowledge obtainable only in the inner circle, was retained by Nazis and their sympathizers. \n\n....It is in this environment of extensive collaboration and infiltration by Nazis and fascists, a collaboration that involves a \nlong-term continuance of Nazi goals separated from earlier German territorial goals, and an overall shepherding and betrayal by \ninternational monied interests, government and intelligence agencies, that America’s descent into totalitarianism, genocide and \nmind control becomes understandable, and the Alternative 3 template first becomes visible.— \n\nKeith’s scenario is clear enough, and it is the same one - in broad outline - adopted here, namely: \n\n1. That with the dispersal of Nazi technology, scientists and engineers into post-war Allied, Soviet, and possibly into covert and \nindependent research programs more directly under Nazi control, and \n\n2. That with the grafting of Gehlen’s Fremde Heere Ost with its extensive espionage network inside the Iron Curtain into \nAmerican intelligence, a powerful clandestine organization was created, an organization with international reach, ambitions, \nand finance behind it. \n\nOnly such an organization could attempt to maintain two space programs, one for public consumption, and another, entirely off the \nbooks, to further the interests, agenda, and power of the elite that controlled it. Only such an organization could attempt to coordinate \nthe otherwise independent “public” space programs of the two superpowers. \n\nSeen in this light, it is easier to see why there was such a heavy Nazi presence in the web of relationships involved in the \nassassination of President Kennedy, for with his threat to “smash the CIA into a thousand pieces,” he was taking deliberate aim at \none of the power structures for this international rogue element. To ensure its continued survival and the survival of its projects and \nagenda, Kennedy had to go. \n\n\n4. The William Lyne Version \n\n\nAlso at the bizarre end of the spectrum of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is the version of New Mexico author and \nconspiriologist William Lyne, who outlines his version in three books, Pentagon Aliens (formerly entitled Space Aliens from the \nPentagon), Occult Ether Physics, and Occult Science Dictatorship. Many dismiss his work, simply because of an abundance of very \nbizarre and oftentimes outlandish assertions, while overlooking some significant insights and hints that also characterize his works, \noftentimes sandwiched between assertions that either repeat the standard “Nazi Legend” of the UFO or of “Hitler Survival” while \nliberally adding new elements. \n\nFor example, Lyne asserts - without any substantiation - that Adolf and Eva Hitler not only survived the war, but were flown out \nof Germany in a flying saucer piloted by the famous German pilot Hanna Reitsch and German Luftwaffe ace Hans Ulrich Rudel!- — \nwas if that were not enough, he adds that they lived happily ever after in Kassel, Germany, protected by a secret NATO \nagreement,— and that on the invitation of President Lyndon Johnson, visited the San Antonio World’s Fair in Texas,— where later, \napparently, Adolf, exercising as ever his attraction to art, and lovely wife Eva visited a west Texas art show where Lyne happened to \nbe sitting sketching pictures! And Lyne leaves no detail to chance, for he even describes the visit by burly security personnel, \ncombing through the art show booths, prior to the arrival of the Fiihrer! If one can imagine an elderly and sweltering Hitler hobbling \nalong in his ever-present double-breasted suit(sans swastika, of course) and porkpie hat with wife Eva dutifully in tow and perhaps \nfilming the whole visit for her famous home movies, one has an appreciation for why many dismiss out of hand the entirety of \nLyne’s other assertions and claims. \n\nFor example, Lyne also asserts that \n\nDuring the war, German scientists bypassed development of the “atom bomb”, and built and tested the neutron bomb. German \nfield Marshall (sic) Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps were originally sent to North Africa to test the neutron bomb, as well \nas Tesla’s “death ray” (whichfreezes whole armies); this technology was acquired by American corporations, held chiefly by \nDavid Rockefeller, and was later sold in part back to the U.S. government and tested in the ‘60s, and the same technology was \nagain sold to the U.S. government in the ‘70s and ‘80s as “Star Wars”(“SDI” or “Strategic Defense Initiative Technology.”— \n\nWhile the assertion sounds wild and fantastic, and indeed, your author does not believe any neutron bomb was ever tested by the \nNazis in Africa or elsewhere, in fairness to Lyne it should be recalled that the alleged Ohrdruf test of a nuclear device that took place \non March 4, 1945,— was of a device with a small critical mass, an event that - if it indeed happened - could only have occurred via \nthe process of “boosted fission,” whereby a neutron-emitting source is added to the critical mass assembly, allowing more neutrons \ninto the initial chain reaction and accordingly a lower critical mass. This is one step away, in a certain sense, from the neutron bomb. \nLikewise it should be pointed out that when Lyne’s assertion was first made in July 1993 in the first printing of Pentagon Aliens \n(under its former title Space Aliens from the Pentagon) the allegations of the Ohrduf test and other German nuclear tests during the \nwar were just beginning to surface, making it unlikely that Lyne based his assertion on these German sources. \n\nLyne’s assertions do not end there, however. He adds even more anecdotal detail to the mix: \n\n(When) prisoners from Rommel’s Afrika Korps were brought to Roswell, New Mexico (!) they carried some rather strange post \ncards apparently printed by Rommel’s field lithographers, showing New York City being destroyed by a mushroom cloud. The \ncamp commandant, Dave Dunn, who later became an engineer with Union Oil Company of California in their Midland, Texas \nOffice, and who prepared the U.S.G.S. for President John F. Kennedy in 1962, thought these were humorous, and showed me \none he had saved as a souvenir. The fact was, however, that Rommel’s main mission in the Libyan desert, was testing the \nneutron bomb. The post cards carried by his troops were a ‘morale builder’, which superimposed the photolithograph of the \nmushroom cloud of the bomb they had actually tested and photographed, over a photolithograph of New York City, in a \ncomposite. The claims by Manhattan Project members, that they built the first ATOM bomb - from German plans - was true. \nEinstein had brought the stolen plans to us with the firm belief that we would use the A-bomb on Germany. Since the Allies \nhad already succeeded in obtaining the German plans for he A-bomb. Wemer Heisenberg merely sidestepped the A-bomb, and \nbuilt the N-bomb. The question to me was not “if’, but “how” (did the Germans make their neutron bomb)?— \n\nThis passage is classic Lyne, interlarding details and insinuations that, in the light of the research of German authors Meyer, Mehner, \nand others, make sense, along with details and insinuations that make no sense. For example, Lyne claims that David Dunn found \nthe postcard of New York City being a-bombed (or n-bombed), “humorous.” One has difficulty imagining how any rational human, \nmuch less an American, could find such a postcard humorous. This detail casts a pall of dubiousness once again over the whole \n\n\npassage, as does the assertion that any a-bomb plans existed at the time Einstein emigrated from Germany to the USA, much less that \nEinstein actually managed to steal them from the security- and Jew-obsessed Nazis. Yet, in these bizarre assertions, Lyne is also \nclearly insinuating a connection between Nazi science, its actual accomplishments, and the Manhattan Project, and all that again in a \nbook published prior to that of Meyer, Mehner, or Friedrich Georg in Germany, or Carter Hydrick in the USA, works which are \nheavily referenced and researched, and by no means the merely “anecdotal” character of Lyne’s Pentagon Aliens. \n\nTo round out the picture even more, Lyne also points out the mysterious substance “red mercury”, or mercury antimony oxide, \nwhich, like Lyne’s work itself, is a substance with its own ambiguous and dubious legend: \n\nDr. Sam Cohen, inventor of the American neutron bomb, traces the production and sale of a mysterious substance called “red \nmercury” to Russia. Red mercury is mercury antimony oxide, specially prepared by irradiation and pressured into a gel to \nincrease its density to create the necessary precondition for a neutron explosion. A small quantity of it can then be used as a \nnuclear trigger/igniter to detonate a small amount of heavy hydrogen producing the deadly neutrons for a ‘clean bomb. — In \nFebruary, 1992, Russian president Boris Yeltsin signed Directive No 75-RPS, authorizing Preomekologia, a Russian company \nheaded by Yeltsin’s ecological advisor, to “manufacture, purchase, store, transport, deliver, and sell for rubles and foreign \ncurrency” ‘red mercury’ in amounts up to ten tons per year. The order was rescinded a year later because of criticism within \nRussia of export of such a “valuable raw material”. In a spring, 2004 documentary on Britain’s Channel Four (“British PBS”), \na Russian nuclear chemist confirmed he had worked with red mercury since 1965, that it is currently produced in a factory in \nthe central Russian town of Ekaterinburg, and that fusion weapons have been made in Russia from it. Cohen believes red \nmercury represents one of the greatest threats for potential terrorists to produce ‘baseball bombs’ from it....If the Germans \nindeed tested a neutron bomb in North Africa, I would bet that is was produced with red mercury, since the Russians employed \nGerman metallurgists and nuclear chemists in their nuclear program, and it was they who produced Germany’s WWH supply of \nplutonium purer that any ever produced....— \n\nAgain, one encounters Lyne’s typical mixture of the seemingly outlandish and bizarre with actual fact, for indeed, Dr. Sam Cohen, \nthe inventor of the neutron bomb, did express such fears and reservations concerning red mercury, while other scientists loudly \ndismissed the substance and its reputed ability to initiate thermonuclear fusion as a complete hoax. And the substance does resemble \na mysterious substance also used in The Bell. \n\nAs was seen, Lyne ends his “red mercury” foray with another fantastic claim, that during World War Two the Germans managed \nto manufacture plutonium of great purity, an assertion that calls into question the Allied Legend in a very direct way, since to \nmanufacture plutonium of any purity one must first possess a functioning nuclear reactor, which the Germans were not supposed to \nhave achieved during the war. \n\nBut again, one cannot be too hasty in dismissing his assertion, for as was detailed in my previous book Reich of the Black Sun, the \nalleged Nazi test of an a-bomb in 1945 at Ohrdruf was of a high yield device of a critical mass of no more than 100 grams, a fact \nwhich, if true, is only possible with very pure plutonium and boosted fission. That is to say, Lyne once again has made a claim that, \noddly, has been paralleled by similar and subsequent allegations originating from post-reunification Germany, and the much more \nsubstantial research of German researchers who, in addition to citing anecdotal stories from elderly witnesses or relatives of \nwitnesses, also seek to corroborate their stories by documentation or other means. \n\nLyne’s tail of a neutron bomb test thus also begins to pry open the door to his version of the Two Space Program Hypothesis, for \nit clearly indicates that one primary element is what the Nazis actually accomplished versus what we have been told that they \naccomplished. Yet another primary aspect of Lyne’s version of the Hypothesis also emerges from this strange account, and that is the \nsecret development of a science and technology otherwise suppressed. And this brings us, at last, to Lyne’s version of the \nHypothesis itself. There are three aspects to his version: (1) Public Consumption Relativistic Physics Versus Occulted Aether \nPhysics, (2) The National Security Act and Scientific Suppression, and (3) The Role of Nazis in the above. \n\n\na. Public Consumption Versus Occulted Aether Physics \n\n\nLyne outlines his case for an occulted physics and technology in a series of clearly stated and provocative questions, and then an \nequally clear and provocative answer: \n\nIs it possible that an entire area of physics has been declared virtually “occult” and “off-limits” to the public or to private \nindividuals, by a powerful group, so that all science education or data generally available to the public has been “screened” to \neliminate references to it? Is it possible that the actual science involved in “electro-propulsion”, has been replaced with a “bogus \n\n\nscience”, which has been promoted and promulgated to the extent that no one except the ‘esoteric elite’ knows the truth? And if \nso, has the “occult” science become the exclusive province of a very few specially selected corporate/govemment “priests”? \n\n.The high priests of this occult knowledge are the elite owners of the coercive monopolist corporate banking, industrial, \n\nmineral and related interests, who in turn allow the initiation of certain scientists, military and government officials into their \nsecret teaching only insofar as it is necessary, to execute and maintain a conspiracy of giant proportions, so that the technology \ncan be classified as a “state secret” which can be controlled and enforced by means of unconstitutional “national security laws”, \nmilitary and civilian legal authority, and police. These measures are intended to protect the archaic technology and resources \ncontrolled by the elite, from the competition of a truly free market society.— \n\nNote the insinuation that the national security apparatus of any nation is involved in this conspiracy. We shall return to this aspect of \nLyne’s version of the Hypothesis in a moment. \n\nFor Lyne, the suppression of “occulted aether physics” requires a program consisting of two central elements: (1) the suppression \nof exotic physics that at one time or another entered the public record, regardless of how obscure the record or how limited the public \nmay have been. As will be seen in a moment, this includes various tactics to make it difficult to reconstruct the suppressed physics. \n(2) The second element is the creation of an alternative version of physics for “public consumption” or as Lyne puts it - also clearly \ndelineating where he thinks the blame lies for the dead end of physics in the 20the century - giving the public “relativistic bromides” \npacked with exotic phrases like “the ‘fabric’ of ‘spacetime’” and “frame-dragging,” all of which, he says, suggest the idea of what \n“they” wish to suppress, namely “the existence of an ether (sic, et passim),—,, even though that aether is an erroneously conceived \n“relativistic” aether.— The reason is deceptively simple: ’’‘Ether Physics’, by its very nature and name, is subatomic physics.\"— \nRelativistic physics, on the other hand, is the physics of the very large. And as numerous physics texts and popularizations have \nreiterated countless times, the quest of physics since relativity and the advent of quantum mechanics has been to somehow squeeze \nthe two theories together. So much for the second element; it is clear that Lyne believes Einstein’s relativity theories to be a crucial \ncomponent of the creation of a “public consumption physics,” a physics guaranteed to dead-end. \n\nBut what of the first element? How does one suppress things that are already part of the public record, even if that record is for a \nrelatively small public, such as the professional community of scientists or scientific historians? \n\nLyne’s answer to this question is hidden in his - for once - well-documented though brief history of the aether, and it is worth \nciting his remarks at length: \n\nAfter some difficulty, I accessed a copy of the classic, A History of the Theories of the Aether and Electricity, by Sir Edmund \nWhittaker (1951 revised and enlarged second edition, Vols. I and II). The 1910 first edition of this book was probably the most \ncomprehensive book ever published on ether theory as it existed in 1910, but the 1951 revision merely clarified “acceptable” \nether physics. The first edition was printed in Scotland, under the title A History of the Theories of the Ether and Electricity, \nfrom the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century. The second edition incorporated “new material” related to \nquantum mechanics. Classical theory was in Vol. I, while Vols. II and II gave the origins of relativity and quantum theory up to \n1926. Neither the 1910 first edition nor the 1951 revision mentioned Tesla, but the chronological sequence appeared to be \n“skewered” in the revised edition, with little or no attempt to point out what the scientists were actually aiming at....— \n\nThat is, two effective tactics in suppression of the public record are simply to scramble the chronological sequence of, and delete the \npractical motivations behind, the theory in question. \n\nA third tactic is evident in a later remark: \n\nThough it was said by Whittaker that the Hall Effect, like the magnetic rotation of light, occurs only in ponderable bodies and \nnot in the “free ether”, this statement was patently false, since the effect actually depends on the conductivity of a medium. This \nwas a definite lie on Whittaker’s part, probably “required” under the 1951 revision. The fact that the effect occurs in \n“ponderable bodies” and “conductive media” however, is all-important for electropropulsion, since it shows the reaction \nbetween such bodies and media and the underlying “etheric framework” which is accessed in the process.— \n\nIn other words, when all else fails, simply lie, or leave out part of the truth. Note also that Lyne is clearly implying that Whittaker \nwas “required” to do so, i.e., that some pressure was exerted on him. This fact will become much more significant, since one of \nWhittaker’s early 1903 papers was one of the founding papers of “scalar” physics, a non-linear form of aether physics, as we shall \nsee in a subsequent chapter. Whittaker and the two editions of his classic history of the aether is thus a pivotal though (to the general \npublic) still largely unknown figure in the story. \n\nAt any rate, Lyne concludes that “Whittaker’s 1951 edition intentionally skewered important facts concerning electropulsion....By \nreorganizing Whittaker’s material into more proper order, / discovered much ‘new ’ (‘old’) documentation, that 19 th century scientists \n\n\n\nwere in pursuit of electropropulsion. “— \n\n\n(1) Lyne’s History of Aether Physics \n\n\nIn order to appreciate Lyne’s version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis fully, it is necessary to see its centerpiece - the work \nof Nikola Tesla and its alleged continuation under the Nazis - within the wider context of the reconstruction of “aether physics” that \nLyne undertakes. Accordingly, this section will perhaps seem somewhat long and perhaps a bit technical. Nevertheless, it is essential \nto Lyne’s argumentation that Tesla was an aether physicist par excellence.— As Lyne puts it, “It was my intent to examine known \ntheory leading up to Tesla, to see what he contributed to their discoveries, and to determine what happened since that time to \nobscure, misinterpret and ultimately conceal it.”— \n\nCentral to this reconstruction is the work of 19 th century physicist J.J. Thomson, discoverer of the electron. \n\nThomson had theorized, based on Maxwell’s earlier theory - that a charged spherical conductor moving in a straight line must \nproduce displacement current in the medium (Phil. Mag. Xi (1881), p. 229). In 1893, twelve years later, he claimed to have \ndiscovered “electromagnetic momentum”, saying \"... in an electromagnetic field there is stored in every unit volume an amount \nof mechanical momentum, proportional to the vector product of the electric and magnetic vectors.” (J.J. Thomson, Recent \nResearches in Electricity and Magnetism [ 1893], p. 13.) Thomson also was said to have developed the theory of moving tubes \nof forces - which harked back to Faraday’s earlier work - saying in 1891 that molecular structure is closely connected with \ntubes of electrostatic forces, with magnetism regarded as a secondary force. He stated that “...the aether itself is the vehicle of \nmechanical momentum, of amount (1/4 n C ) [D-B] per unit volume.” (Phil. Mag. xxxi [1981], p. 149; Recent Researches in \nElectricity and Magnetism [1893], chap. 1).— \n\nNote that the basic motivation for the experiment, and the basic discovery or theory, is that of electro-propulsion or momentum. And \nthis, claims Lyne, is the single unifying factor of much 19 th and early 20 th century experimentation.— \n\nBut chronologically and empirically, this makes no sense, as Lyne points out, and with this next observation, the central figure of \nhis version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis arrives on the scene: Nicola Tesla: \n\nJ.J. Thomson’s theory, which linked electromagnetism with momentum in a mathematical and unified way, on paper, \nsomewhat repeated Tesla’s earlier lecture of 1891, proven by his earlier experiments, but Tesla’s theory was different from \nThomson’s whose theory was incorrect. Thomson’s electromagnetic momentum could be created instantaneously only with \nTesla’s contrivances, which existed before Thomson’s “discovery”, only in Tesla’s laboratory, so there is no way that Thomson \ncould have reduced “his” theory to practice or experimentally verified it.— \n\nEqually important to Lyne’s argument that electrical momentum and propulsion was a central unifying motivation to the scientific \npursuits of the 19 th century, was the work of another Thomson, this time William Thomson (Lord Kelvin).— \n\nLord Kelvin asserted in 1856 in the prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society— that magnetism possessed rotational \ncharacteristics that were bound up with the heat and thermal motions of a body. Kelvin’s work is significant precisely because Tesla \n“made many references... to his work as a prelude to his own discoveries and applications.”— By 1870, Kelvin had performed some \nexperiments that, as Lyne summarizes them, “seemed to indicate that ‘gravitation action’ could be induced by spheroidal bodies \noscillated by electrical currents or mechanical pulses.”— \n\nThen came a more provocative discovery. \n\n(Kelvin) found that ponderomotive forces act between two solid bodies immersed in an incompressible fluid, when one of the \nbodies is immobilized and made to oscillate with a force which acts along a line between its center and that of a much larger \nsphere which is free. The free sphere was attracted to the small (immobilized) sphere, if its density was greater than the fluid, \nwhile a sphere of less density than the fluid was repelled or attracted, according to the ratio of its distance to the vibrator in \nrelation to a certain quantity.— \n\nLord Kelvin’s experiments were expanded upon by C.A. Bjerknes between the years 1877 and 1910. \n\nBjerknes showed that when two spheres immersed in an incompressible fluid were pulsated, they exerted a mutual attraction \nwhich obeyed Newton’s inverse square law if the pulsations were in phase, while if the phases differed by a half wave, the \n\n\nspheres repelled. At one quarter wave difference, there was no action. Where pulses were non-instantaneous at distances greater \nthan a quarter wavelength, attractions and repulsions were reverse. — \n\nNote again that the motivation of the experiment is the investigation of the inertial and gravitational properties of the aether via an \nanalogical experiment of spheres in an incompressible fluid. Likewise note an even more important fact, one whose importance, \nagain, will become apparent in the chapter examining “scalar physics,”— the behavior of the spheres is due to the fact oj \nlongitudinal waves in the medium , in this case, the incompressible fluid. — \n\n\n(2) Lyne’s Version of Tesla Physics \n\n\nIt is in this wider context that we now come to the centerpiece of Lyne’s reconstruction of physics and his version of the Two \nSpace Programs Hypothesis: the work of Nicola Tesla, and what Lyne believes was its hidden and ultimate motivation all along. As \nLyne points out, the articles he cites in Occult Ether Physics were available to Tesla “during his student days at the Polytechnic \nInstitute in Graz, Austria.”—■ Moreover, Tesla’s admiration for and use of Lord Kelvin’s work in his own experiments is well \nknown. \n\nNikola Tesla is almost the raison d‘etre of suppressed physics. No other single scientist or engineer has contributed so much to \nmodem society and culture and yet, no other scientist or engineer has been subject to such a “long and thorough eradication of (his) \nname from encyclopedias and books on science, invention and technology” to the extent of Tesla. — So thorough has this been that \nhe is almost “the ‘invisible man’ of science history.”— \n\nThe conspicuous vacuum created where the mention of Tesla should have been, as one who made such important contributions \nto science, technology, and the quality of our lives, raises ominous questions as to why his memory became virtually stricken \nfrom history almost the day after his death. What did Tesla discover which threatened the powers that be? Since we already \nknow about the many patented inventions, my assumption has always been that the unknown, still classified works were far in \nadvance of the published ones, and were in realization of projects which Tesla had previously announced or had already tested \nand developed, but had not yet ’’...given to the world.”— \n\nThese inventions and ideas, “the very existence of which is categorically denied by establishment and corporate scientists,”— were, \naccording to Lyne, centered on five things: \n\n1. exotic flying machines based on electrodynamic propulsion methods; \n\n2. discoveries implying that that energy could be extracted from the medium, or environment; \n\n3. transmutation of the chemical elements; \n\n4. an “alternative ‘ether’ physics and science”; \n\n5. Tesla’s “Dynamic Theory of Gravity.”— \n\nLyne believes that the first of these elements was the real unifying motivation to much of Tesla’s lifelong research, particularly in his \nlater years, and the other four elements were made in aid of the first. \n\nCiting an article in the September 22, 1940 edition of the New York Times by William L. Laurence, Lyne notes that Tesla claimed \nto have discovered a new force which he called the “teleforce.” Expanding on his famous Colorado Springs experiments, Tesla \nexplored this force in discoveries and experiments between 1900 and 1940, claiming to have found a new way to create waves in the \natmosphere, a “‘new’ way to create a ‘very great electrical force,”’ as well as a new way to magnify that force, and a new means of \nelectrical propulsion.- — Indeed, Tesla had maintained this vision of an electrical flying machine since the 1870s, when it first \noccurred to him as a student. Lyne observes that it was to realize this machine that was the reason Tesla “said he originally entered \nthe field of electrical science in 1875 in the first place.”— In other words, Lyne believes that the creation of an electrical flying \nmachine is the unifying theme and ultimate motivation of all of Tesla’s life’s work. \n\nIn a lecture in 1938, Tesla stated that the central theory of all the above five elements - his “dynamic theory of gravity” - had been \nworked out by 1893.— In that lecture, Tesla referred to two significant discoveries that he planned to “give to the world” when he \nhad completed “his secret developments.”— Those two discoveries, according to Lyne, were the Dynamic Theory of Gravity and \nidea of “environmental energy,” i.e., the idea that “there is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment. ”— \n\nLest Tesla’s assertions be thought to be merely quirky restatements of relativity, it must be remembered that \n\n\nTesla considered his theory wholly inconsistent with the theory of relativity, and with the modem theory concerning the \nstructure of the atom and the mutual interconversion of matter and energy. Tesla continuously attacked the validity of Einstein’s \nwork; and until two or three years before his death he ridiculed the belief that energy could be obtained from matter.— \n\nIn a certain sense this is due to Tesla’s habit of thinking in terms of nineteenth century aether physics, but in another, it is due to the \nnature of the discoveries he was making since his Colorado Springs experiments, discoveries that took him into the most avante \ngarde areas. \n\nWhile clearly derived from his Colorado Springs experiments, Tesla’s Dynamic Theory of Gravity did not get any public airing \nuntil that 1938 lecture, given to the Institute of Immigrant Welfare on May 12, 1938. This, in Tesla’s own words, is all that is \npublicly known of that theory: \n\nDuring the succeeding two years (1893 and 1894) of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far reaching \ndiscoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very \nsoon. It explains the causes of this force and the motions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put \nan end to idle speculation and false conceptions, as that of curved space.... \n\nOnly the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses \nwith space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings \nof the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena. \n\nMy second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As I have searched the entire scientific records in \nmore than a half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself the original discoverer \nof this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in matter other than that received from the \nenvironment. \n\n.... It applies rigorously to molecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to all matter in the universe in \nany phase of its existence from its very formation to its ultimate disintegration.— \n\nThe idea of “environmental energy” may seem obscure, but the radical nature of Tesla’s assertion may be appreciated if one \nconsiders his lifetime’s preoccupation: electricity. What Tesla is in effect saying through his (always) carefully chosen language is \nthat in any electrical circuit or conductor, it is not so much the power “source” that produces the power, but rather that such a source, \nalong with the parameters of the circuit itself, is an open system transducing power from the medium. This is a revolutionary \nstatement to make, especially in 1938. \n\nBut there is a hint of Tesla’s advanced views on the aether and what his “dynamic theory” of gravity may have entailed, if his \n1938 statements are viewed in the wider context of previous developments in general and especially the experiments of Lord Kelvin \nin particular. This is his clear allusion to the motion of heavenly bodies and to the fact that his twin observations are scale invariant, \ni.e., applicable to all sizes of matter from atomic to planetary scales. Thus it would seem that Tesla appears to be viewing the aether \nin not only a dynamic sense, but as a structure of rotation, of vortices. — These are significant indicators that Tesla was already \nthinking in terms of higher order topologies than relativity theory. — \n\nTo see Tesla as a conventional 19 th century aether physicist in his late life is, however, to massively distort the picture. Tesla wrote \nan unpublished article toward the end of his life called “Man’s Greatest Achievement,” in which he states some very unusual, very \nnew, and, as it turns out, very old, — views of the aether: \n\nLong ago (man) recognized that all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or a tenuity beyond conception, filling \nall space, the Akasa or lumeniferous ether, which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana or creative force, calling into existence, \nin never ending cycles, all things and phenomena. The primary substance, thrown into infinitesimal whirls of prodigious \nvelocity, becomes gross matter; the force subsiding, the motion ceases and matter disappears, reverting to the primary substance. \n\nCan Man control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all process in nature? ... \n\nIf he could do this, he would have powers almost unlimited and supernatural....He could alter the size of this planet, control \nits seasons, guide it along any path he might choose... He could cause planets to collide and produce suns and stars... \n\nTo create and to annihilate material substance... would be the supreme manifestation of the power of Man’s mind, his most \ncomplete triumph over the physical world, his crowning achievement, which would place him beside his Creator, make him \nfulfill his ultimate destiny.— \n\nAs will be seen in chapter five, Tesla’s views eerily echo those of “scalar” physicist Tom Bearden. Tesla’s view of the aether \nshows his thinking to be far from the inert and static aether of nineteenth century physicists, or even the kind of aether envisioned by \nMax Planck and other physicists, who envisioned a quasi-hydro dynamic aether that was “drug along” with planets. As this passage \n\n\nmakes clear, Tesla envisioned it as a transmutative aether analogous to electrical carriers “immersed in an insulating fluid” whose \nproperties varied according to the local environment. — \n\nB ut what does all this mean? \n\nHere, it is best to cite Lyne’s catalogue of Tesla’s own statements, followed by Lyne’s own summary of their implications. Lyne \nassembles a series of quotations by Tesla to demonstrate eight points: \n\n1. “The most probable medium filling space is one consisting of independent carriers immersed in an insulating fluid. ” \n\n2. “In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced by electrostatic force, which he considers in the light of \nmodern theories to be the most important force in nature for us to investigate.” \n\n3 . “He illustrates how mechanical motions are produced by a varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous \nmedium,” \n\n4. “One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a \ngaseous medium upon which vibration is impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic potential, is rigid.” \n\n5. “If through this medium enormous electrostatic stresses are assumed to act, which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the \nmotion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and elastic, although the fluid itself might be devoid of these properties.” \n\n6. “...on the assumption that the independent carriers are of any configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one \ndirection is greater than in another, a stress of that nature would cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since they \nwould turn to each other their sides of the greatest electrical density, in which position the fluid resistance to approach \nwould be smaller than to receding.” \n\n7. ”If in a medium of the above characteristics a brush would be formed by a steady potential, an exchange of the carriers \nwould go on continuously, and there would be less carriers per unit volume in the brush than in the space at some distance \nfrom the electrode, this corresponding to rarefaction.” \n\n8. ”If the potentials were rapidly changing, the result would be very different; the higher the frequency of the pulses, the slower \nwould be the exchange of carriers; finally, the motion of translation through measurable space would cease and, with a \nsufficiently high freguency and intensity of the stress, the carriers would be drawn towards the electrode, and compression \nwould result. “— \n\nLyne summarizes the practical nature of these insights as follows: \n\n1. Mechanical motions can be produced by varying electrostatic force acting through a gaseous (ether) medium, which thereby \nbecomes rigidified, yet allows solid bodies to pass through. \n\n2. Under influence of stress in one direction... the carriers may group together, forming tubes of force, creating greater ease of \nmovement in that direction. \n\n3. When a (direct current) brush is created by a steady potential, a continuous exchange of carriers is created corresponding to \nether rarefaction, as the tubes of force are drawn into the conductor. \n\n4. With a sufficiently high frequency and stress intensity in the opposite direction, carrier exchange is blocked by ether \ncompression, forcing the tubes of force to dissolve in the conductors of the ship, imparting electromagnetic momentum. The \nsystem, using the two kinds of potentials (direct current and alternating current), is known as “p2 ”— \n\nThe last point assumes a particular significance in the light not only of Tesla’s quest for an electrically propelled flying machine, but \nalso, as we shall see, in the light of the known design and operating principles of the Bell. \n\nLyne, summarizing Tesla’s views on the aether and electrical circuits as open systems, notes that electrical motive force is not due \nmerely to “varying currents” but to “rarefaction and compression of the ether” brought about by rapidly varying and different kinds \nof currents.— The implication was that, while as early as 1884 Tesla had done calculations for his flying machine when he first \nimmigrated to the United States,— he later claimed that his ’’dirigible torpedo” could achieve speeds of 300 miles per second, or an \nincredible 1,080,000 miles per hour!— \n\nThe idea of the compression and rarefaction of the aether via electrical stress caused by two types of electrical potential, coupled \nwith the idea of the structure of matter being nothing but vorticular motion in that aether, makes Tesla’s views far ahead of their \ntime. Indeed, by discovering the twin characteristics of the aether as longitudinal compression and rarefaction, as well as vorticular \nmotion, Tesla laid the foundations of “scalar physics” as we shall see when we examine the work of Tom Bearden. Tesla actually \nwent so far as to discover the “endothermic explosion” (cold explosion) uses of such wave phenomena: \n\nTesla discovered that by using a low frequency beam-directed pulse, he could cause, at the quarter wavelength, the eruption of \n\n\na large electromagnetic pulse which could, by carrying a much higher exciting wave, excite the atmospheric gases in a region, \nto explosively expand them, followed by a tremendous implosion and the absorption of a great amount of heat in the area, \ncausing immediate freezing. This process would create an initial explosive shock wave followed by the implosive return wave, \nsimilar to nuclear detonation. For example, by using a low frequency of 60 (cycles per second), with a wavelength of 3,100 \nmiles, directed by carrier-beam, a pulse could be made to erupt at one-quarter wavelength - 775 miles, corrected to 751 miles by \nvelocity factor. By superimposing an exciting frequency of say 50 megahertz or so, the atmospheric gases could he excited to \ncause a “cold implosion ” which absorbs heat. By altering the warelength and the direction of propagation, the results could \nbe delivered to any terrestrial point.— \n\nKeep in mind this “cold explosion” and “explosive atmospheric heating” at a distance, for these will be seen to be significant \nsignatures of scalar weapons deployment. Indeed, Tesla chose his name for his new force — “teleforce” — very carefully, for that \nvery name designated the application of “force at a distance. ”— And as will be seen in the next chapter, the electrical stress of the \nmedium via two types of potential, in addition to high frequency pulsation, and vorticular motion, appears to be the very principles in \noperation in the Bell. \n\nFrom what has been stated, it is obvious that Lyne views Tesla’s theoretical and practical work as a prototypical “unified physics” \nthat can develop a technology with a variety of applications, from propulsion to weaponry of planet-busting potential. \n\n\nb. The National Security Act and Scientific Suppression \n\nTesla’s post-Colorado Springs discoveries were deemed “not fit for public consumption.” And this required, of course, an entity to \ncoordinate and monitor the suppression of such physics and to coordinate any further secret development of it, to promulgate a \n“public” version of physics destined to proffer untestable theories publicly while privately developing entirely different paradigms, \nand to coordinate the secret development of exotic physics and associated technologies. That entity Lyne believes was created, or \nperhaps better put, was sanctioned by the National Security Act of 1947. \n\nTo corroborate this, Lyne observes that Tesla’s contemporary, friend, and biographer, John J. O’Niell, who wrote the classic \nbiography Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla, attempted no less than three times to publish the book, all in the same month! \nLyne quips: \n\nIn case you are wondering, the three publishings in the same month were not due to landslide sales at the bookstores, but rather \nto O’Niell’s having been threatened and censored by the FBI, and forced to republish several times because of their deletion \nand censoring of material which to this day is still classified.— \n\nTesla, contrary to government disinformation, was a careful note taker. As Lyne puts it, “the notes on his Colorado Springs \nexperiments alone were enough for a large-format book of 433 pages.”— And over his entire lifetime, Tesla managed to produce \nmore than a railroad boxcar full of material, most of which was confiscated by the FBI on his death, as only 150,000 documents \nwere released to his Serbian relations in Yugoslavia.— \n\n\n(1) Strange Nazi Parallels \n\n\nAt this juncture Lyne’s version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis begins to take its final shape. Lyne states that after the \narrival of Von Braun and other Project Paperclip scientists in the US after the world war, the military-intelhgence community from \nAir Technical Command at “Wright-Patterson Air Force Base hurried up to the warehouses of the Custodian of Alien Properties, \nand took possession of all the Tesla materials. They removed them to Wright-Patterson, and every bit of them have been classified at \nthe highest level ever since, the government having declassified NONE of them.”— In other words, the Air Force had discovered \nsomething in the Nazi research that was based upon and a further elaboration of some aspect of Tesla’s work. \n\n\nc. The Nazi Role in Occulted Aether Physics \n\n\n(!) Roswell, MJ-11, and Disinformation \n\n\nLyne believes that the answer to that question is very specific, and that part of the answer lies not only in the creation of the \nNational Security apparatus of the United States in 1947, but in the undue influence that the Paperclip Nazis continued to exercise \nwithin that community. For example, Lyne quite openly states that the entire Roswell incident was “an SS hoax”, perpetrated by the \nPaperclip Nazis in New Mexico who were, in fact, SS officers.— As a result of the American confiscation of the most sensitive \nNazi scientific documents, Lyne believes unhesitatingly that not only is most UFOlogy manipulated by the CIA or other intelligence \nagencies, but also that the MAJIC-12 documents are an elaborate disinformation campaign hatched within the bowels of the \nintelligence community,— possessing partial truth, and partial falsehood. Similarly, and for our purposes, more importantly, Lyne \npoints out the obvious fact that since such Nazi documentation as concerned itself with such exotic physics, weapons and propulsion \nsystems was confiscated by America (or, equally plausible, remained under German control or at least influence), then the so-called \n“plans” and “documents” of the SS supposedly detailing Nazi flying saucers are also fakes, part of an elaborate disinformation \n195 \n\ncampaign.- 5 ^ \n\nBut oddly, and most chillingly, Lyne points out that the two largest and most notorious agencies established by the National \nSecurity Act, The Central Intelligence Agency and The National Security Agency, are but direct English translations or metaphrases \nof Reichsicherheithauptamt, the infamous R.S.H.A, which may be literally translated as “National Security Agency” and loosely \nalso connotes a central, or main, clearing office, or “central intelligence” or “security” agency.— \n\n\n(2) Von Braun’s Alleged Pre-War “P2 ” Project in New Mexico \n\n\nGiven all that Lyne alleges concerning Tesla’s views and his “p2” lecture in London demonstrating electromotive properties of \ntwo plates with different types of potential (alternating and direct current), it is a short and, one must admit, believable step for Lyne \nto maintain that this work quickly came to the attention of the Nazis, who like the Soviets a generation later, were searching for areas \nof anomalous or exotic physics to exploit, elaborate, and develop. Thus, Lyne maintains that before the war, Wemer Von Braun and \na small and select team of German scientists went to New Mexico and there performed preliminary experiments on Tesla’s ideas, a \nproject Lyne calls the ”p2” project, after Tesla’s two different potentials.— \n\nHaving assured themselves of the viability of Tesla’s science, Lyne asserts that Von Braun and company returned to Germany \nwhere the work was continued in great secrecy and behind a number of “camouflage” black projects, such as rockets and \n“aerodynamic saucers.” The cover-up continued after the war under the aegis of the National Security Act and the Naziinfluenced \nCIA, which had taken over the whole of German military intelligence on the Eastern Front, General Reinhard Gehlen’s Fremde \nHeere Ost (Foreign Armies East). These combined government, military, corporate, and Nazi entities conspired to conceal the aether \nphysics behind Relativity. This Teslian “aether physics”, according to Lyne, is the ‘“classified science’ that the government conceals \npursuant to the National Security Act.”— \n\nWhat is one to make of Lyne’s version? \n\nFirst, while certainly possessing its outlandish and fantastic elements, it is clear that many aspects of it resonate with other \nresearchers’ more recent inquiries. In fact, it was Lyne who first connected Tesla, exotic Nazi technology, the Nazi influence in the \npost-war American military-industrial complex, and the notion of hoaxes and disinformation in the UFOlogy community. \n\nSecond, Lyne clearly believes that there is a suppressed, or occulted, physics, developed in secret, but recoverable if one carefully \nsifts the published physics papers and views them in a certain way, along the lines of the aether paradigm. This, as will be seen in \nchapter five, is quite similar to Tom Bearden’s belief in a similar such repressed — but reconstructable — physics. \n\nThird, Lyne has indicated certain signatures of the application of that physics when weaponized: atmospheric heating or, \nalternatively, “cold explosions.” Moreover, Lyne has clearly indicated the planet-busting potential of such weapons. \n\nWhile most of Lyne’s version of the Hypothesis sounds like the sheerest fantasy, this aspect, at least, is also shared by Bearden, a \nhighly credentialed and widely published scientist. \n\n\n5. Both Feet In Atlantis: the “Jan Van Helsing ” Version \n\n\nOn the decidedly bizarre end of the Two Space Programs spectrum are the curious allegations of the pseudonymous “Jan Van \nHelsing,” a researcher into the occult basis of exotic Nazi technology. Like the other pseudonymous source “William Torbitt” \nexamined previously, Van Helsing outlines a scenario of a coordinated “private” group of secret societies behind the Nazis pursuing \nexotic weapons technologies. Unlike Torbitt, however, Van Helsing also displays evident sympathy for some of these societies and \nby implication for the Nazis themselves. Nonetheless, Van Helsing’s allegations are too important to be ignored. \n\nVan Helsing published his views in a work entitled Secret Societies: Their Power and Influence in the Twentieth Century, a work \nnot easily available except in an excerpted version on the internet.— \n\nVan Helsing repeats many of the themes of the Nazi UFO Legend, including those that place the beginning of Nazi secret \nweapons research in very secret pre-war projects of these secret societies, namely, the so-called “Vril Gesellschaft, ” named after the \n“vril” or aetheric energy of Sir Edward Bullwer-Lytton’s famous novels of a long-lost subterranean civilization that had preserved \nthe secrets of this mysterious energy, and the more famous or infamous Thule Gesellschaft, the secret society that actually helped to \nmidwife the Nazi Party into existence. These ideas are nothing new in the lore of the Nazi UFO legend. What is new with Van \nHelsing are the odd details that he adds to the mix. \n\nFor example, Van Helsing states that the Vril Society “was mainly occupied with the building of UFOs. They had, next to Viktor \nSchauberger and Dr. W. O. Schumann, also Schriever, Habermohl, Miethe, Epp and Belluzo working for them.”— In other words, \nVan Helsing makes the astonishing claim that all of the alleged “flying saucer experts” that were associated with the development of \nthese exotic technologies since Rudolf Lusar first broke the story in the 1950s were members initially of a secret society whose \nprimary purpose was the building of such craft. All the Nazis did, apparently, was to continue the project under their own occult- \ninspired jurisdiction: the SS. \n\nBut beyond this, Van Helsing also makes two other assertions with this remarkable statement, one very blatant, and the other only \nimplied. In the first case, he baldly asserts that world-renowned scientist and physicist W.O. Schumann, discoverer of the so-called \n“Schumann Resonance” of the earth, was himself an initiate into this society, and was cooperating on these projects. In the second \ncase, Van Helsing is clearly implying by his unsubstantiated allegation that some group inside Germany was involved in the secret \ndevelopment of an “off-the-books” physics and technology long before the Nazis came to power. In this, his allegations are similar \nto those who believe that the 1890s “airship” flaps in the USA were brought about by a secret group that had covertly designed, \nperfected, tested, and flown the first “airships”. \n\nWere these the only allegations that Van Helsing makes, it would be fairly easy to simply dismiss them with a smile and a \nchuckle, and move on. However, Van Helsing also couples his allegations to the known occult doctrines of these secret societies as \nthe primary motivation behind the Nazi projects, and in so doing, proposes his own “Nazi” version of the Two Space Programs \nHypothesis. The importance of his allegations lies, therefore, in its odd corroboration of Richard Hoagland’s belief that many NASA \nlaunches and mission “logos” were coordinated in reference to occult doctrine and practice, particularly to celestial alignments. \n\nThis strange history begins, according to Van Helsing, in 1917, during World War One, when \n\nThe occultist BARON RUDOLF VON SEBOTTENDORFF, the Gurdjeff (sic) disciple KARL HAUSHOFER, the ace pilot \nLOTHAR WAIZ, PRELATE GERNOT of the secret “Societas Templi Marcioni” (The Inheritors of the Knights Templar) \nand MARIA ORSIC, a transcendental medium from Zagreb met in Vienna. They all had extensively studied the “Golden \nDawn”, its teachings, rituals and especially its knowledge about Asian secret lodges. Sebottendorff and Haushofer were \nexperienced travelers of India and Tibet and much influenced by the teachings and myths of those places. During the First \nWorld War Karl Haushofer had made contacts with one of the most influential secret societies of Asia, the Tibetan Yellow Hats \n(dGe-lugs-pa). This sect was formed in 1409 by the Buddhist reformer Tsong-khapa. Haushofer was initiated and swore to \ncommit suicide should his mission fail. The contacts between Haushofer and the Yellow Hats led in the Twenties to the \nformation of Tibetan colonies in Germany. \n\nThe four young people hoped that during these meetings in Vienna they would leam something about the secret \nrevolutionary texts of the Knights Templar and also about the secret fraternity DIE HERREN VOM SCHWARZEN STEIN \n(“The Lords of the Black Stone”).— \n\nAgain, there is, on the surface, nothing new about Van Helsing’s allegations; one encounters the familiar names — Von \nSebottendorff and General Haushofer, Hitler’s “geopolitics” guru — in connection with familiar themes: the fascination for the \nOrient and for its “secret wisdom”. \n\nBut, again, Van Helsing imparts new information — again without the slightest substantiation — that is unique to him, namely, \n\n\nthat the Vienna meeting was for a twofold purpose: (1) to acquire knowledge about some apparently (very) secret Templar texts, and \n(2) to acquire knowledge about an even more secret fraternity, the Lords of the Black Stone. And of course, lest it be forgotten, the \nwords Black Stone, in German, are schwarzen Stein, abbreviated as “SS”. It is not long, therefore, before Van Helsing couples this \nnew twist to another ancient occult doctrine, the “Black Sun” ( schwarze Sonne) of illumination, also abbreviated “SS.”— \n\nThen in September of 1917, Baron Von Sebottendorff allegedly met with leaders and members of this mysterious “Lords of the \nBlack Stone” fraternity in “Untersberg to receive the power of the ‘Black-Purple Stone’ after which the secret society was \nnamed.”— Again, no substantiation or evidence of this assertion is offered. However, perhaps a very indirect corroboration exists in \nthe form of the famous traveler-explorer-occultist Nicholas Roerich, an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roerich, of \ncourse, had a similar preoccupation with “magic stones”, namely, the celebrated chintimanti stone of Mongolia. \n\nIn any case, whatever happened in September 1917 appeared to have been successful, for in 1918 a group formed around Von \nSebottendorff in Bad Aibling, which would become the notorious Thule Society. It is here that “scientific magic, astrology, \noccultism and Templar knowledge as well as ‘Golden Dawn’ practices like Tantra, Yoga and Eastern meditation” were all \ncombined.\"— And among this potent mix was also a tincture of messianism, for the Thule Gesellschaft also ’’believed, following the \nRevelation of Isis, in a Coming Saviour (German: Heiland = the Holy One), the ‘Third Sargon’ who would bring to Germany glory \nand a new Aryan culture.\"— In other words, the program was a total one: the goal of the secret society not only continued to be to \n(re-)discover and (re-)construct a lost and exotic technology of hegemony, but it also sought to place its ideas and agendas into \npower. Once in power, it would maintain itself in authority by the very technological means it was seeking to (re-) discover. Thus, \nby implication Van Helsing is saying that one of the hidden or “occulted” agendas of the Nazi Party since its inception was always \ntechnological and occult in nature; it was committed to the (re-) discovery of a lost and buried technology of hegemony, in short, to \nthe creation of exotic and massively destructive weapons. It was, so to speak, the one political party in the world with an occult- \nweapons agenda that could be called “Atlantean.” It was the one political party in the world with both feet planted firmly in Atlantis. \n\nTo drive home this point, Van Helsing cites the famous work of Dietrich Bronder, Befor Hitler Kamm (Before Hitler Came), \nwhich lists the following people as members of the Thule Gesellschaft: \n\n1. Baron Rudolf von Sebottendorff, Grand Master \n\n2. Guido Von List, Master \n\n3. Jorg Lanz Von Liebenfels, Master \n\n4. Adolf Hitler, later Reichschancellor, and “SS Superior” \n\n5. Rudolf Hess, later Deputy Fiihrer and SS Obergruppenfiihrer \n\n6. Hermann Goring, Reichsmarschall and SS Obergruppenfiihrer \n\n7. Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfiihrer SS and Reichsminister \n\n8. Alfred Rosenberg, Reichsminister and NSDAP Reichsleiter \n\n9. Hans Franck, NSDAP Reichsleiter and later Governor General of occupied Poland \n\n10. Juilius Streicher, SA Obergruppenfiihrer \n\n11. Major General Prof Dr. Karl Haushofer, occultist and geopolitician, considered to be the architect of Hitler’s Lebensraum \ndoctrine \n\n12. Prof Dr Gottfried Feder \n\n13. Dietrich Eckart, poet, occultist, and Editor in Chief of the Volkischer Beobachter newspaper \n\n14. Bernhard Stempfle, confidant of Hitler \n\n15. Dr. Theo Morell, Hitler’s personal physician \n\n16. Franz Gurtner, Munich police president \n\n17. Rudolf Steiner, founder of the Anthroposophic society \n\n18. Prof Dr W.O. Schumann of the Munich Technical University \n\n19. Trebisch-Lincoln, occultist and Tibetan traveler \n\n20. Countess Westrap.— \n\nThis list is illuminating in a number of respects. \n\nFirst, it provides a general context from which to view the possible occult influences at work behind the Nazi Antarctic expedition \nin 1938-1939, for that expedition was under the patronage of Reichsmarschall Goring. Second, it provides a similar context from \nwhich to view the allegations of some that Hess was privy to whatever secrets that expedition found, and that these were the ultimate \nmotivation for the Allied Powers keeping him — or his imposter — imprisoned for so long after the war. Finally, it provides an \ninteresting context from which to view the Third Reich and its secret weapons black projects themselves, projects which included a \nheavy admixture of occult doctrine and experimentation. From a glance at the list, it is apparent that the SS itself is the visible \n\n\nextension of the Thule Gesellschaft into the Third Reich. Or, to put it differently, via the National Socialist Party, an occult secret \nsociety had seized the reigns of authority in one of the world’s great powers, and could thus direct the entire energies of that state \ninto the overt and covert pursuit of its agendas. \n\nAmong the doctrines held by the Thule Gesellschaft that lay behind the Nazi ideology were an “Ayro-Germanic construction of \nreligion...by the philosopher Guido Von List... a leaning towards the anti-Old Testament” views of an early Christian heresy known \nas Marcionism.— This was augmented by the “esoteric history” of the Aryans believed by the Thule Gesellschaft, a history \nreconstructed from ancient German and Scandinavian myths. Chief among these was the belief in “Hyperborea,” the continent \npopulated by the “ancient Aryans,” with its capital city of “Ultima Thule,” both of which were located in “the highest north”. \nMoreover, these “ancient Aryans” were space travelers from a planet in the star system of Aldebaran, the main star in the \nconstellation of Taurus.— \n\nAccording to this myth, the continent sank during the last ice age, whereupon, with customary Teutonic preparation, the ancient \nAyrans were supposed to have burrowed into the earth and “settled under the Himalaya region” in huge subterranean cities bored \nout with huge machines.— This in turn forms the rationale for the “two large expeditions” that were “sent by the SS to the \nHimalayas to find those entrances. Further expeditions searched in the Andes, the Matto Grosso mountains in the North and the \nSanta Catarina mountains in the South of Brazil, in Czechoslovakia and parts of England.”— \n\nAs Van Helsing also mentions, Hitler’s geopolitician, General Karl Haushofer, had his own personal dualistic twist to this \ndoctrine, claiming that \n\nThule was actually Atlantis and - contrary to all other researchers of Tibet and India - he said that the surviving Thule - \nAtlanteans were separated into two groups, a good one and an evil one. Those who called themselves after their oracle Agharti \n— were the good and settled in the Himalaya region, the evil ones were the Shamballah — who wanted to subjugate humanity \nand they went West. He maintained that the fight between the people of Agharta and Shamballah had been going on for \nthousands of years and that in the Third Reich, the Thule Gesellschaft as Agartha’s representative - continued it against the \nrepresentatives of Shamballah, the Freemasons and the Zionists. This perhaps was his mission.— \n\nHaushofer allegedly then went on to found in 1919 “a second order, the ‘Briider des Lichts ’ (sic)(Brothers of the Light),” the society \nthat later became the Vril Gesellschaft .— According to Van Helsing this new secret society united the society known as Die Herren \nvom Schwarzen Stein (The Lords of the Black Stone), which allegedly emerged from the old Teutonic Order, and the Schwarze \nRitter (Black Knights) of the Thule Society and the SS elite of the Schwurze Sonne, or Black Sun.— \n\nThe occasion of this founding was apparently a meeting in which members of these various secret orders met in a rented forester’s \nlodge near what would later become Hitler’s lair, in Berchtesgaden. The meeting was also attended by two mediums, who had \n“mediumistically received transmissions in a secret Templar script — a language unknown to her — with the technical data for the \nconstruction of a flying machine. According to Vril documents these telepathic messages came from the solar system Aldebaran \nwhich is sixty-eight light-years away in the constellation Taurus.”— \n\nAs part of this message, the mediums were “informed” that the non-white races were in “lower (stages) of spiritual development,” \nand that “the more the races intermixed, the lower the spiritual development of these people sank.”— They were also “told” that the \n“divine” people of “Aldebaran” had colonized “the planet Mallona (also called Maldek, Marduk or — by the Russians — Phaeton) \nwhich existed in the area of today’s asteroid belt, then between Mars and Jupiter.”— Of course, the idea of the asteroid belt having \nbeen a former planet that had exploded is an old hypothesis, first entertained in the early nineteenth century by astronomers after the \ndiscovery of the second asteroid, and as they sought to explain why Bode’s Law predicted a planet should be in the orbit of the \nasteroid belt.— \n\nWhat is crucial to notice, however, is that Van Helsing’s allegation makes it clear that someone inside of Germany had connected \nthe astronomical theory of an exploded planet to certain ancient Sumerian myths, most likely that of the Enuma Elish, an ancient war \nepic that describes the destruction of the now missing planet by means of an ancient weapon of mass destruction.— \n\nBut Van Helsing does not stop there, for he also connects these occult practices, secret societies, astronomical theories, with the \nsecret development of a new science and new technology: \n\nWe cannot know whether these statements about Aldebaran were based on facts, but the construction plans and the technical \ndetails that the Vril telepaths received - wherever they came from - were so accurate that they led to the most fantastic idea men \never begot: the construction of a Jenseitsflugmaschine, a “flying machine for the other side.”— \n\nLet us pause to consider exactly what these statements mean. \n\nFirst, Van Helsing supplies considerably more detail in what is otherwise the old story that the Vril Society receives UFO plans \n\n\nfrom mediums, namely, he supplies the secret societies that came together, and names the mediums involved,— the time,— and the \nplace, a forester’s lodge near Berchtesgaden! But secondly, as the remarks immediately above make clear, his interest is not so much \nthese allegations, but rather that they led to the development of an entirely different technology and science by a secret society \nfounded for the purpose by the very man later to be Hitler’s geopolitician! \n\nAs if that were not enough, Van Helsing then goes on to make the following statement: \n\nDuring this early phase of “alternative science” Dr. W. O. Schumann of the Technical University in Munich, both a Thule and \na Vril member, held a speech a section of which is reproduced here: \n\n“In everything we recognize two principles that determine the events: light and darkness, good and evil, creation and \n\ndestruction - as in electricity we know plus and minus. It is always: either — or.The coming new age will be an age of a \n\nnew, positive, divine technology!”— \n\nVan Helsing then notes that these remarks — one of the few that he “substantiates” — are drawn from “the German SS secret \narchives.”— \n\nAccording to Van Helsing, the first “saucer” was secretly built by the Vril Society in 1922.— He follows this up with even more \nspecific information. For example, he alleges that this machine was tested for two years before it was “dismantled and probably \nstored in the Augsburg works of Messerschmitt.”— Moreover, there were entries in the financial records of German aviation \ncompanies “under the codename ‘JFM’ (for Jenseitsflugmaschine)” that showed “payments towards financing this work.” — \n\nBut it is when Van Helsing arrives at World War Two and the continuation of these projects under the Nazis that his fantasia \nknows no bounds. For example, he alleges that “at the beginning of 1943 it was planned to build in the Zeppelin works a cigar¬ \nshaped mother ship,” a machine called the “Andromeda Device”, with a length of around 150 yards, capable of storing “several \nsaucer-shaped craft in its body for flights of long duration,”— or perhaps better stated, flights of Adamski-esque imagination. \n\nBut immediately after these sensational and highly questionable allegations, Van Helsing again comes up with more \nunsubstantiated specifics: \n\nBy Christmas 1943 an important meeting of the Vril Gesellschaft took place at the seaside port of Kolberg. The two mediums \nMaria Orsic and Sigrun attended. The main item on the agenda was the Aldebaran Project. The mediums had received precise \ninformation about habitable planets around the sun Aldebaran and one began to plan a trip there. At a January 22, 1944 meeting \nbetween Hitler, Himmler, Kunkel (of the Vril Society) and Dr. Schumann this project was discussed. It was planned to send the \nVril 7 large-capacity craft through a dimension channel independent of the speed of light to Aldebaran. According Ratthofer a \nfirst test flight in the dimension channel took place in the winter of 1944. It barely missed disaster... — \n\nIn addition to all this, Van Helsing also states that these exotic craft “should create an extremely strong field around itself extending \nsomewhat into its surroundings which would render the space thus enclosed including the machine a microcosm absolutely \nindependent of the earthbound space. ”— \n\nAll of this exotic research was conducted under the Nazis, according to Van Helsing, by a group “within the SS” that was \n“studying alternative energy, the SS-E-IV,” or S S Entwicklungstelle IV (SS Development Group IV). Here Van Helsing is on more \nsolid ground, for there was indeed such a group in the SS, whose top secret brief was precisely to research “alternative energy.” But \nVan Helsing adds his customary occult twist, for he calls this group “Development Group IV of the Black Sun,” or Schwarze Sonne, \nabbreviated “SS”. The doctrine of the Black Sun ( Schwarze Sonne) or Black Stone ( Schwarze Stein) was the secret doctrine of the \nSS known only to Himmler’s highest SS generals.— The purpose of this group was “to render Germany independent of foreign \noil.”231 \n\nWhat emerges from all this is that there were two space programs already in existence in Nazi Germany, a “public” space \nprogram, that was in fact the “secret ” rocket program of Von Braun and the Peenemiinde scientists, and a much more secret, and \nmuch earlier, one, that begun by the secret societies and later continued by the SS, a program with a completely different physics and \ntechnology. \n\nWhile most of Van Helsing’s fantasia inevitably strikes one as absurd, certain aspects of it fit the broad outlines one has come to \nexpect with Nazi secret weapons development: an undercurrent of occult inspiration, development in utter secrecy, the search for a \nnew physics and new technology, the evident reliance upon and knowledge of ancient myths in the reconstruction of that science \nand technology, and the fusion of these with other occult doctrines - “root races”, extraterrestrial human origins, and so on — and a \ngenocidal political agenda. \n\nIf, as Van Helsing suggests, this dual track program was in fact begun by pre-war secret societies, then one method of testing his \nallegations might be to see if there is any indication that after the war the same or similar groups continued the lines of exotic and \n\n\n\nesoteric research the SS was pursuing during the war. \n\nIn any case, Van Helsing’s is not the last word in the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. Indeed, if David S. Percy and Mary \nBennett are correct, then not only were the Two Space Programs that were begun by the Nazis during the war continued after the \nwar both by the Soviet Union and the United States, they moreover exhibited much more coordination between them than the space \nprograms of alleged rivals should really exhibit, especially at the height of the Cold War where the ultimate prize — the Moon — \npromised rich benefits in prestige and military position to whomever got there first. \n\n\n\n6. The Dark Moon Version \n\n\nBritish authors David S. Percy and Mary Bennett are the latest in a long line of researchers who question the historical record of \nthe Apollo manned Moon missions. This is not to say that they are of the typical “Apollo-was-entirely-hoaxed” genre. Quite the \ncontrary. As they put their own case, the purpose of their book, Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistleblowers, is “to question the \nentire validity of the official record of mankind’s exploration of the Moon especially the Apollo lunar landings. We are not however \nclaiming that astronauts from Earth have never walked on the Moon.”— That is to say, they believe mankind went to the Moon, but \nthat it did not happen in the way we have been told it happened. \n\nLike many researchers who question the official explanation of the Apollo program and its celebrated Moon landings, Bennett and \nPercy offer a compelling case that many of the Moon photographs allegedly taken by the astronauts while on the Moon were in fact \nphotographs that were taken on a set. Like many others, they cite the usual discrepancies in lighting, varying angles of shadows \nwithin single frames, light sources from areas supposedly in shadow, and so on. Unlike many others, they do not cite these anomalies \nas proof that we never went, but only to raise questions about the official version of the way we went. And the Two Space Programs \nHypothesis is crucial to their reconstruction of what they believe actually happened. \n\nOn their view, the Two Space Program Hypothesis takes on the following outline: \n\n• The foundations for the grand space project were laid down during WWII. \n\n• The project was conceived and designed as a collaboration between two superpowers. \n\n• The Cold War was a convenient cover under which aspects of this project could be implemented and hidden. \n\n• All these machinations were orchestrated at the very highest level, with only a select and hidden few ever knowing the overall \n\nobjectives of the project. \n\n• These objectives have not yet been achieved in full. We are referring to a project that has been around at least since 1947 — \n\nand it divides into several sections. \n\n• Put another way, NASA’s Apollo phase, seen by the public to be the end result of a decision made in the 1960s by President \n\nKennedy was in fact only a small (but significant) part of a greater plan. \n\n• Whatever humanity has experienced concerning the rivalries between the super powers of this world, today, at some very \nhigh but invisible level, our attitudes are being molded to suit an agenda which does not necessarily have all our interests at \nhart.— \n\n\nWhat is of interest here is the clear connection of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis to the famous events of 1947 — Kenneth \nArnold’s first “ULO” sighting in Washington state and the later even more famous “Roswell incident” with all its attendant \ncorollaries — but more importantly, to the events of World War Two. In this respect, Bennett and Percy are unique. \n\nMoreover, they repeatedly hint at a Nazi connection, or at least, implication to their approach, for “without the remnants of \nHitler’s war machine, our first steps into space would probably have occurred decades later.”— According to Bennett and Percy, the \ndeceptions that became so much a part of the public policy of NASA — deceptions already noted in this chapter in connections with \nother versions of the hypothesis — were already in place well before the agency had even been established. The policy decisions \nleading to these deceptions began, as they point out, in the “pre-and post-war period in Germany.”— The deceptions originate, in \nfact, with a deliberately muddied picture of Operation Paperclip. As Bennett and Percy quip: \n\nNow follows some interesting arithmetic. We are told by (David) Baker that the German scientists began arriving at Port Bliss \nin October 1945 (that is the advance guard of Von Braun and his small team of five) and by March 1946 their numbers had \npeaked - at the grant total of thirty nine. \n\n(Paperclip scientists) Stuhlinger and Ordway inform us that there were three shipments and a total of 118 men arriving in \nAmerica between November 1945 and Pebruary 1946. So by 1946 the American Army have already lost 85 scientists. Were \nthey declared AWOL or were they housed elsewhere, and not at Port Bliss? Were some of them at Almogordo perhaps? From \n127 total German rocket scientists allowed into America under Operation Paperclip we have a total of 6 +118 = 4. \n\nBut their suspicions predate even Operation Paperclip and the inability of the historical record to come up with anything like a \nconsistent number of German scientists and technicians actually brought to the USA. \n\nThe Two Space Programs may have actually begun, at least on the Allied side of things, during the war itself. In evidence of this \nallegation, Percy and Bennett proffer the R.A.F’s massive 600 bomber raid against the Peenemiinde facility in 1943. \n\nThanks to information from Germany supplied by Paul Rosbaud, codenamed ‘Griffin’, the British put Operation Hydra into \n\n\naction, designed to eliminate 1) the engineer’s residential quarters 2) the missile pre-production facility and 3) the R&D \nlaboratories/offices. From nine minutes past midnight on August 18 and over forty seven minutes, 600, yes six hundred. Royal \nAir Force aircraft marked targets and then dropped 1,593 tons of high explosives and 281 tons of incendiary bombs onto \nPeenemiinde. However, from the beginning the start point of the bombing run was altogether mis-identified - the northern \npeninsular (sic) of Peenemiinde being lit by the target indicators rather than the designated Ruden Island situated two miles \nfurther north. As a result of this initial ‘blunder’, the air raid failed in two-thirds of its avowed objectives.... Instructions from the \nhighest level, it seems, had been to target personnel and certainly not the V-2 rocket production facilities.— \n\nIndeed, even in targeting personnel the raid was not much of a success, since “of the eight hundred personnel on the ground who did \ndie about half were from the prisoner labor force (mostly Soviets) and the other half were technicians and their families.”— The \nimportant scientists — Kurt Debus, Wemer von Braun, Hermann Oberth et al — survived. \n\nSo this raises the specter of a last minute change in the operational plan of the raid, a change effected at the highest level. The \nRAF, not noted for inaccuracy or incompetence on its bombing raids over Nazi Germany, received faulty information on the \ncoordinates for the starting point for the bombing run itself. Such an alteration “would have ensured that the advance pathfinders \nplaced the marker flares ‘too short’ and/or ‘too long’, thus ensuring the safety of the individuals and rocket technology desperately \nneeded by those that knew — the ‘masters of infinity’.”— Simply put, Bennett and Percy believe, on the basis of this singular and \nunique failure of the RAF to deliver its customary knockout punch to a target, that crucial areas of Peenemiinde were deliberately \nspared in order to capture its technology and scientists after the war. \n\nBut immediately after the war, things became even stranger. After careful consideration of the various accounts, Bennett and \nPercy concluded that both the Soviets and Americans arrived at the notorious Mittelwerk — the underground factory for building V- \n2s using concentration camp slave labor, constmcted by SS General Kammler- at the same time and moreover cooperated in \ndivvying up the booty!— Such glaring discrepancies \n\nMost certainly uphold our theory that this entire period was being organized as a cohesive whole and was not just a ‘race’ \nagainst time to see who could bag the bigger haul of documents, materials and men. This plan was surely a precursor to the \n‘space race’ story, which was also designed to look like one thing but actually to function in a completely different way.— \n\nWhile the USA was shipping a few hundreds of German scientists to the USA, along with Von Braun and the precious documents \nhe brought with him, the Soviet Union rounded up over three thousand technicians who had worked on the rockets, and whose new \njob for their new Soviet masters “was to re-establish the documentation taken by von Braun.”— It was a convenient division of the \nspoils. \n\nAnd perhaps a bit too convenient. \n\nBennett and Percy point out that in 1958 a British publisher, Robert Maxwell, attended symposia in Moscow for the international \ngeophysical year. While there, Maxwell returned to his hotel room one day with a sixty three page manuscript containing what were \nsupposedly “book titles” and asked his wife to photograph the pages quickly, as the papers absolutely had to be returned before \nlunch. His wife recounts how \n\nby page thirty two she noticed that they were not book titles at all, but were “Die deutschen Firma, deren Einrichtung \ndemontiert und zur Ausfiihr nach der Sowjetunion bestimmt sind.” Which translates as: “German firms whose equipment is to \nbe dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union.” ...It is significant that this Soviet shopping list was written in German. \n\nWhy was is not in Russian?— \n\nOne answer to this disturbing question is, of course, that the divvying up of the “booty” had been decided before the end of the war, \nand by the Nazis themselves. We shall see in a moment how this idea actually — and most curiously — is able to explain and unite \nthe various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. \n\nBennett and Percy’s version of the Hypothesis now reaches its final and full development. Noting that the Soviet Union began to \nreturn these German technicians in three drafts, beginning in 1952, and ending in 1954 when the last of the technicians were \nrepatriated to Germany, they make clear one crucial difference between the Soviet Union’s use of Nazi scientists, and the American \none. In the Soviet Union these technicians were principally employed teaching Russian university students, which students in turn \ngained practical hands-on experience by working in the Russian space program while they were still students.— In this one may \ndetect the steady hand of Sergei Korolev, as well as appreciate the reason for the early Soviet successes in space achievement. The \nSoviets at least appeared to be serious about freeing their program from undue Nazi influence as quickly as possible. \n\nAnd this brings us, finally, to Bennett’s and Percy’s version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis: \n\n\nMost conveniently, at the end of WWII the political globe had been divided into two - one ‘public sector’ in the West and one \nprivate sector in the East. What could be more simple than to exploit this division and lower the iron curtain in exactly the same \nway as the safety curtain comes down in the theatre. This ruse enabled the organizers of the space project to go to work in \nrelative obscurity. \n\nIn the sense that two teams were targeting the Moon there was always a space race. In reality the objectives were not those of \ncompetition. These two teams, while wearing different colours, were in truth on the same side. And even if many of the key \nplayers were unaware of the real script, it is likely (in our view) that at least both Korolev and von Braun were aware of the true \nsituation.^- \n\n\nThus, in the Bennett and Percy version of the Hypothesis, the two space programs are precisely that of the US and NASA, the \nprogram for “public consumption”, and that of the USSR, the covert program which carried on the secret agenda of its hidden \nmasters. Indeed, as they point out, control of these two programs was vested in no more than “a few score men” who also \n“controlled the services of some of civilization’s most highly trained specialists” and “the large funds appropriated for \narmaments.”— \n\nBut to assert that the two superpowers’ space programs were carefully contrived along “public” and “private” lines is to suggest a \ndegree of coordination between them that hitherto was hardly ever seriously suggested. However, this, Bennett and Percy urge, is \nprecisely what the record seems to indicate. “The American/Soviet space timetable demonstrates how carefully progress in space had \nbeen shared between them, with alternating monthly flights in some cases. This can only have been the result of close planning and \ncontinuous liaison at the very highest levels.”— In support of this suggestion, they produce the following launch schedules of the \nrespective programs: \n\n\nAgency \n\nDate \n\nMission \n\nUSSR \n\nJan 2. 1959 \n\nLuna 1 \n\nUSSR \n\nSept 12, 1959 \n\nLuna 2 \n\nUSSR \n\nOct 4. 1959 \n\nLuna 3 \n\nUSA \n\nAug 23, 1961 \n\nRanger 1 \n\nUSA \n\nNov 18, 1961 \n\nRanger 2 \n\nUSA \n\nJan 26. 1962 \n\nRanger 3 \n\nUSA \n\nApr 23. 1962 \n\nRanger 4 \n\nUSA \n\nOct 1962 \n\nRanger 5 \n\nUSSR \n\nApr 2. 1963 \n\nLuna 4 \n\nUSA \n\nJan 30. 1964 \n\nRanger 6 \n\nUSA \n\nJut 31. 1964 \n\nRanger 7 \n\nUSA \n\nFeb 20. 1965 \n\nRanger 8 \n\nUSA \n\nMar 24. 1965 \n\nRanger 9 \n\n\nUSSR \n\nMay 9, 1965 \n\nLuna 5 \n\nUSSR \n\nJune 8, 1965 \n\nLuna 6 \n\nUSSR \n\nJuly 18. 1965 \n\nZond 3 \n\nUSSR \n\nOct 24, 1965 \n\nLuna 7 \n\nUSSR \n\nDec 3. 1965 \n\nLuna 8 \n\nUSSR \n\nJan 31, 1966 \n\nLuna 9 \n\nUSSR \n\nMar 31. 1966 \n\nLuna 10 \n\nUSA \n\nJune 2. 1966 \n\nSurveyor 1 \n\nUSSR \n\nAug 24. 1966 \n\nLuna 11 \n\nUSA \n\nSept 20. 1966 \n\nSurveyor 2 \n\nUSSR \n\nOct 22, 1966 \n\nLuna 12 \n\nUSSR \n\nDec 21. 1966 \n\nLuna 13 \n\nUSA \n\nApr 20,1967 \n\nSurveyor3 \n\nUSA \n\nJuly 14. 1967 \n\nSurveyor 4 \n\nUSA \n\nSept 11. 1967 \n\nSurveyor 5 \n\nUSA \n\nNov 10. 1967 \n\nSurveyor 6 \n\nUSA \n\nJan 10. 1968 \n\nSurveyor 7 \n\nUSSR \n\nApr 7. 1968 \n\nLuna 14 \n\nUSSR \n\nSept 14. 1968 \n\nZond 5 \n\nUSSR \n\nNov 10, 1968 \n\nZond 6 \n\nUSA \n\nDec 21. 19681 \n\nApollo 8 \n\nUSA \n\nMay 18. 1969 \n\nApollo 10 \n\nUSSR \n\nJuly 13, 1969 \n\nLuna 15 \n\nUSA \n\nJuly 16. 1969 \n\nApollo 11 \n\nUSSR \n\nAug 7, 1969 \n\nZond 7 \n\nUSA \n\nNov 14. 1969 \n\nApollo 12 \n\nUSA \n\nApr 11. 1970 \n\nApollo 13 \n\nUSSR \n\nSept 12, 1970 \n\nLuna 16 \n\nUSSR \n\nOct 20. 1970 \n\nZond 8 \n\nUSSR \n\nNov 10, 1970 \n\nLuna 17/Lunikhod \n\nUSA \n\nJan 31. 1971 \n\nApollo 14 \n\nUSA \n\nJuly 26. 1971 \n\nApollo 15 \n\nUSSR \n\nSept 2, 1971 \n\nLuna 18 \n\nUSSR \n\nSept 28, 1971 \n\nLuna 19 \n\nUSSR \n\nFeb 14. 1972 \n\nLuna 20 \n\nUSA \n\nApr 16. 1972 \n\nApollo 16 \n\nUSA \n\nDec 7. 1972 \n\nApollo 17 \n\n\nUSSR \n\nJan 8, 1973 \n\nLuna 21/Lunikhod 2 \n\nUSSR \n\nMay 29. 1974 \n\nLuna 22 \n\nUSSR \n\nOct 1974 \n\nLuna 23 \n\nUSSR \n\nAug 9. 1976 \n\nLuna 24 16 * \n\n\n— But why the secrecy? And why the apparent coordination between the two programs? Bennett and Percy pull no punches: “We \npropose that the secret and subtle aspect... was the certain awareness by the authorities of the existence of extraterrestrial \nintelligence. \n\nMoreover, “this awareness of ET was the driving force behind their mission to land on the Moon. However, the Moon was only a \nstaging post to their avowed destination — a manned mission to a location on the plains of Cydonia, Mars.”— While Bennett and \nPercy do not offer much to elaborate why they believe these things, what should be noted is the clear implication of their remarks, \nnamely, that this “ET awareness” was the real hidden agenda driving both space programs since the end of World War Two, and the \nreal hidden goal of both was a manned flight to Mars, again, since the end of World War Two. \n\nWhile not offering much to substantiate this astounding assertion, they do offer a couple of clues, namely, that in addition to a \n\n\npublic and private consumption space program, there was also a public and private consumption physics that accompanied the two \nprograms. First, they note that during the era when both superpowers were still conducting atmospheric tests of hydrogen bombs, \nthese tests curiously produced auroral displays in the opposite hemisphere from that in which the detonation took place. That is, \nhydrogen bombs are partially harmonic devices.— Very little is ever publicly discussed in physics texts about this phenomenon. The \nquestion is: why? \n\nThe second phenomenon, and one which clearly indicates an attempt by NASA to suppress serious and extended public \ndiscussion, is a much more serious one. \n\nThere is a significant phenomenon concerning the alleged outward journey to the Moon during ‘Apollo 11 ’ which has to our \nknowledge never been elaborated upon, explained, or indeed mentioned in relation to any of the subsequent Apollo ‘trips’ - a \nphenomenon which may have assumed gigantic proportions for NASA and the space scientific community. So much so that (as \nfar as we can tell) it has been ‘locked down’ in an attempt to sweep any discussion or knowledge of it under the carpet. \n\nTo what are we referring? \n\nIt is the neutral point, which is also called the equigravisphere. This location is just what it says it is: \n\n• The point between two planetary bodies where the gravitational ‘pulls’ between the two bodies cancel each other out. \n\n• Once this point is space is passed, a craft is no longer affected by the gravity of the planetary body which it (is) leaving \n\nbut is now progressively under the influence of the planetary body towards which it (is) moving.— \n\n\nThe “Neutral Point Discrepancy” is one of the glaring features of the Apollo programs and their published data, and it raises a \nnumber of very important questions. \n\nIt was Sir Isaac Newton who had first calculated the EarthMoon neutral point using his theory of gravitation. That theory gave \nhim an average Earth-Moon distance of 238,900 miles, and the neutral point thus occurred at approximately 23,900 miles from the \nMoon. — This of course gave the now familiar figure that the Moon’s gravitational attraction was about 1/6* that of the Earth. \n\nBut then came a 1969 edition of Time magazine, an interview with Wemer Von Braun himself, and the beginning of a persisting \nmathematical mystery concerning the Earth-Moon dual planetary system. Time reported that “43,495 miles from the Moon lunar \ngravity exerted a force equal to the gravity of the Earth, then some 200,000 miles distant.” And that, note Percy and Bennett, “gave a \ntotal distance to the Moon of 243,495 miles.“— And it means something more, which Bennett and Percy do not mention, namely, if \nthis neutral point figure is correct, then the Moon is much more massive than any standard view of celestial mechanics will allow. \nThe difficulties that this poses - which Bennett and Percy never adequately address - will be seen in a moment. \n\nIn any case, Bennett and Percy note that a mere two weeks after the Time magazine article, Wemer Von Braun quite suddenly \nresigned all his NASA posts and took a position as Vice President of Engineering for Fairchild Industries, leading them to ask a \nquestion many other researchers have asked in regard to the Neutral point Discrepancy: “Could that Time magazine article...have \nanything to do with Wemher von Braun’s somewhat hasty departure for pastures new?”— It is my opinion that it definitely did, and \nthe possible reasons - once again - will be seen in a moment. \n\nWhatever else the Time article may have done for the space science community, at the minimum it began, according to Bennett \nand Percy, a process of “arithmetical obfuscation” that can only be seen as deliberate, since to view what happened next as not being \ndeliberate would be akin to charging NASA with gross mathematical incompetence. For example, in the 1981 edition of Baker’s \nSpace Technology the Apollo 11 distance to the Moon is given as 253,475 miles. But in 1989 the book Apollo 11 Moon Landing \ngave the distance as just under 250,400 miles. Then in 1996, Baker’s Spaceflight and Rocketry gave the neutral point as 38,925 \nmiles from the Moon and 214,550 miles from Earth, giving a total distance to the Moon of 253,475 miles. Then, to really complicate \nmatters, George Pinter assured authors Bennett and Percy that the neutral point really was exactly what Von Braun told Time \nmagazine, namely, 43,495 miles.— Yet, prior to the Time article, and according “to the majority of references” the old Newtonian \nfigure was still being used to calculate the neutral point.— \n\nThe question is of prime importance, since either figure for the neutral point gives very different gravities for the Moon, and \nconsequently, very different trajectories for any craft going there, and, more importantly, very different/we/ and thrust requirements \nfor any rocket-powered craft lifting off from the lunar surface, such as the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module). Obviously, this also \nraises a significant set of questions. “Is it not interesting,” Bennett and Percy ask, “that no sources agree on the exact distance of the \nMoon’s orbital path?”— Moreover, in order to trajectory any craft to the Moon, both NASA and the Soviets would have had to \nknow this average distance “to the last inch,’. So why is it so difficult for NASA to confirm some set figure? ’’Why is the \nEarth/Moon centre-to-centre distance missing from the published Apollo information? Where one can find the craft’s trajectory, the \nEarth/Moon distance is often missing or vague. Where one can locate the Earth/Moon distance, the craft’s trajectory is often missing \n\n\nor vague.\"— To confound matters even further, ’’space experts at NASA or elsewhere, do not state whether they are using planetary \nsurface-to-surface or centre-to-centre measurements. Nor do they always state whether they are using nautical miles or statute miles. \nNor do they stick to any one system.\"— In short, ’’the only consistency in the Earth/Moon measurement scenario is the \ninconsistency of the data emanating from official sources. “— \n\nPercy and Bennett’s way out of this impasse is to posit that the 23,900 mile figure - the Newtonian figure - is correct, and that the \nfigure revealed by Von Braun to Time magazine is the “experienced” neutral point. Their reasons for doing so are plain: \n\nNASA and the Soviets used the Moon’s 1/6G as part of the calculations for their successful slingshot manoeuvres around the \nMoon and also for the calculations relating to energy requirements for their crash lander and soft lander probes, including those \nthat actually returned samples to the then Soviet Union. If the evaluation of the lunar gravity had been incorrect, then surely \nnone of these manoeuvres would have been successful.— \n\nBut what if the reverse was true? \n\nIt hardly stands to reason that Von Braun was “resigned” from NASA for having made a whopping mistake in his interview to \nTime. Nor does it stand to reason that he was “resigned” from NASA for having deliberately lied to Time. The only scenario that \nmakes sense is that he was forced to resign because he revealed something that he should not have. \n\nIf one assumes that the 43,495 mile neutral point was accurate and not merely an “experienced” neutral point as Bennett and \nPercy would have it, then this raises a number of significant points: \n\n1. This neutral point calculation was clearly made much earlier in both the Soviet and American space programs than it was \npublicly revealed by Von Braun. If, as Bennett and Percy state, the Newtonian figure had been used for early probes, these \nwould have either crashed into the Moon or careened off into space. Telemetry data would have eventually given scientists a \ncorrect neutral point calculation. \n\n2. But this raises a new question. For the above scenario to have occurred, then probes would have had to have been launched \nto the Moon much earlier than the public record shows. The question thus is, when was the 43,495 mile neutral point figure \nactually known, and who discovered it? \n\n3. The Time magazine neutral point also raises another signal difficulty, and that is that with a neutral point of 43,495 miles, the \ngravity of the Moon would be a whopping 60% that of the Earth! — As Bennett and Percy rightly point out, this \ndramatically increases the energy, and hence the fuel, requirements for any craft landing on the Moon’s surface and \nsubsequently taking off again from it. \n\n4. This in turn raises a significant question regarding the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) of the Apollo missions, the craft that \nactually landed on and then blasted off from the surface of the Moon. Many researchers have pointed out that the LEM has \nlittle blast signature from a rocket when it is taking off from the Moon to return the astronauts to the command module. This, \nso many say, is evidence of a hoaxed Moon shot. I do not believe this explanation to be plausible or credible. For one thing, \na rocket exhaust in a vacuum leaves little visible plume. But what the lack of blast signature may also indicate, I believe, is \nthat the rocket was not the primary lift component of the LEM. In other words, if - and it is a very considerable if - the \ngravity of the Moon is considerably higher than the public has been told, then this would account not only for the unusually \n“heavy” movements of the astronauts while on the Moon, but also would tend to indicate that the primary lift component of \nthe LEM was not a chemical rocket at all, but another form of technology altogether. And that means a secret technology, \nand a significant aspect of the space program that is also secret, \n\nIn other words, Von Braun had let something slip, something whose significance, if followed through to its logical conclusion, \npointed not so much to the Apollo missions as having been hoaxed, but as having occurred by means of a science and technology \nvastly different from the public version. \n\nVon Braun’s remark plus the lack of much of a rocket blast from the LEMs when lifting off from the Moon may indicate the \nexistence of an off the books planetary science - the Moon’s actual versus its publicly-stated gravity - and an off the books \ntechnology. \n\n\nB. Conclusions and Speculations \n\n\nA glance at the basic features of the several versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is now in order: \n\n\n\nl.The Torbitt Version has the following features: \n\n\na. A worldwide network of dummy corporations exists to further and protect big oil interests. These entities are a literal \n“Murder Incorporated” since they are not above using assassination and other illegal methods to protect their interests; \n\nb. This network is intertwined with a network of Eastern European emigre communities, which are in turn mostly the creatures \nof German military intelligence on the Eastern Front during World War Two, and were thus directly answerable to General \nReinhard Gehlen and possibly his successors; \n\nc. These business and emigre networks are intertwined with the American intelligence community via the FBI, CIA, and \nNASA security via the organization known as the Defense Industrial Security Command (DISC) under the direction of \nWemer Von Braun; \n\nd. By implicating Von Braun, the Torbitt Document implicates the wider Nazi connections associated with the Gehlenorg and \nwith Operation Paperclip, though the motivations for Nazi involvement in the Kennedy assassination are never clearly \nspelled out. One is left to surmise that at some level the policies of the Kennedy Administration threatened some hidden \ntechnological and/or policy agenda of the space program. \n\n\n\nl.The Hidden Planetary Geology, Climatology, and Archaeology Version: \n\n\na. In any version - the “absurdist” or the more plausible models of Hoagland and others - the common feature is that NASA \n(and by implication the Soviets) know of artifacts on the Moon and Mars, relics of a long-lost technologically sophisticated \ncivilization; \n\nb. NASA and associated agencies have suppressed this information, or, when it is already available to the public, has attempted \nto sway public opinion to the view that such photographic evidence is either a “trick of light and shadow” or artifacts of \nfaulty computer image enhancement and processing; \n\nc. At the same time, NASA has released deliberately tampered photographs and other data to mask possible artifacts on the \nMoon and Mars and any evidence that might indicate contemporary life forms on Mars; \n\nd. NASA further shows repeated evidence of having scheduled launches for significant missions on dates and times that \npossess astrological and occult significance, and moreover has consistently employed Masonic and other esoteric symbolism \nin its mission logos. This in turn suggests a hidden space program or agenda is being manipulated and planned around occult \nlines. It should be stressed that all of the above points are stated only with regard to the American space program, and are not \nmade of the Soviet space program.— \n\n\n3 Jim Keith’s Casebook on Alternative Three Version has the following characteristics: \n\n\na. The actual television “documentary” and the book by the same name, Alternative 3, are elaborate pranks and hoaxes; \n\nb. Nonetheless, the broad outlines of the scenario probably contain some truths; \n\nc. The USA and USSR have conducted a highly secret joint space program coordinated by some unknown entity; \n\nd. The USA’s intelligence community was deeply penetrated in a classic “Trojan Horse” operation by General Gehlen’s \nFremde Heere Ost, subsequently known as the Gehlenorg, under the guise of “fighting Communism”; the Gehlenorg \nmaintained extensive human intelligence networks in Eastern Europe, and its analyses became the basis for America’s \npostwar assessments of Soviet military strength, doctrines, and intentions; \n\ne. Similarly, the American space program was deeply penetrated by Nazi scientists brought into it under the aegis of Operation \nPaperclip; \n\nf. Finally, a number of mysterious deaths and disappearances of physicists, computer scientists, and other technicians of benefit \nto the American SDI program began to occur, which Keith clearly attributes to one of two sources: the Russians, anxious to \nprevent the obsolescence of their nuclear arsenal, or to an unknown independent entity whose technology and interests \nwould be threatened by SDI. In the context of the overall argument of his book, it seems clear that Keith had in mind that this \nentity had some ties to the postwar “Nazi International.” \n\n\n\n4.The William Lytte Version: \n\n\nFor our purposes, Lyne’s version of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis is significant for three reasons: \n\na. Lyne deliberately connects the covert suppression of alternative physics and its secret development to Nikola Tesla whose \nideas, he maintains, were subsequently taken up by the Nazis, expanded upon, and developed. In Lyne’s view, the secret \nsuppression and development of this technology is directly linked to facets of Nazi ideology that favor “corporate fascism”; \n\nb. In Lyne’s view, this covert development of “Tesla technology” concerns mostly the development of new energy and \npropulsion sources and technologies that make the “public consumption” technology of space exploration by chemical \nrockets entirely obsolete; \n\nc. This covert “corporate-fascist” development of alternative technology was begun by the Nazis before the war and continued \nby them - under various corporate and U.S. Government agency sponsors - after the war. \n\n\n\n5. The Jan Van Helsing Version contains perhaps the most interesting - if unsubstantiated - features: \n\n\na. German research into exotic physics and propulsion systems began long before World War Two under the direct inspiration \nand auspices of various secret societies; \n\nb. These societies in turn held doctrines that were later to become part of the ideology and belief system of the Nazi Party, \namong them the doctrine of racial purity, and the extra-terrestrial origin of the “Aryan” race; \n\nc. Similarly, these societies maintained that this race and its high culture had “sunk” or disappeared beneath the earth in vast \nsubterranean cities under the poles and the Himalayas; \n\nd. These societies in turn helped midwife the Nazi Party into existence, and their most hidden doctrines - The “Black Stone” \nand the “Black Sun” - became the hidden doctrines of the upper echelon of the SS, which also continued their research into \nexotic physics. \n\n\n\n6.The Dark Moon Version: \n\n\nThe Dark Moon version is in many ways the most subtle of the versions, with the exception of Richard Hoagland’s, for authors \nMary Bennet and David Percy are far from maintaining that there were no Apollo moon landings. They question, rather, the details \nof the record and the technological and political implications that those details seem to suggest: \n\na. Central to one of their arguments is the Neutral Point Discrepancy between the Earth and the Moon. As has been seen, \nBennett and Percy use this discrepancy to argue - in my opinion erroneously - for an “alternative physics”. While the Neutral \nPoint Discrepancy does point in that direction, I believe that it may be taken as a significant indicator that what Von Braun let \nslip in his Time magazine interview was in fact a piece of information that implied the existence of a very advanced \ntechnology of propulsion in the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) in addition to - or perhaps in place of - its conventional \nrockets. The existence of such a technology points to the existence of a covert space program; \n\nb. In Bennett and Percy’s version, the two space programs of the USA and USSR in fact represent the public and covert \naspects, respectively, of one program being coordinated and manipulated behind the “public consumption events” of the \nCold War. This of course implies some entity or agency of coordination existing both within the Soviet Union and the United \nStates; \n\nc. In their version this coordination was planned during World War Two, implying that the Nazis and their space scientists were \nsomehow linked to, or were identical to, the hidden agency coordinating the Two Space Programs after World War Two and \nduring the Cold War. \n\n\n\n1 .Combining The Versions: \n\n\nIf one now combines the common features of these various versions of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis a rather interesting \npicture begins to emerge. \n\na. Two of the versions - Lyne’s and “van Helsing‘s” - maintain that the origin of the Two Space Programs occurred before the \nwar, and that both of them occurred in conjunction with independent entities conducting exotic research; \n\nb. Two of the versions - Hoagland’s and “Van Helsing’s” (!) - maintain that some aspect of the hidden program and agenda is \ndominated by occult and esoteric themes; \n\nc. Two of the versions - Jim Keith’s and “William Torbitt’s” - connect this hidden space program to a carefully hidden and \nextensive Nazi network of intelligence agents and scientists, and imply a “Trojan Horse” deep penetration of the post-war \nAmerican intelligence, military-industrial, and aerospace communities; \n\nd. All of the versions either explicitly or implicitly imply the existence of an off-the-books development of a new technology \nand an underlying framework in a theoretical physics that is very different from that found in texts “for public consumption;” \n\ne. One version - Lyne’s - explicitly offers a “hidden history” of physics to buttress its claims, offering an interpretation of some \nof Tesla’s late work; \n\nf. One version - Hoagland’s - also explicitly states that there is a new type of “hyperdimensional physics” connected with the \ndiscovery of artifacts on Mars; \n\ng. One version - Bennett and Percy’s - explicitly states that there was a covert element of cooperation between the USA and \nUSSR in early space exploration, though it does not clearly name the entity for coordinating such cooperation; \n\nh. One version - again Bennett and Percy’s - also suggests an element of suppressed physics and planetary mechanics by \nexploring the problems surrounding the Earth/Moon system’s Neutral Point Discrepancy, and this implies the possibility that \nan alternative and secret propulsion technology may have existed in the L.E.M.(Lunar Excursion Module). \n\nViewed in this way it is clear that no matter how one approaches the data, there does appear to be a solid case that much more was \nand is afoot in the American and Russian space programs than has been publicly revealed. \n\nAdditionally, it seems clear that at least some of this hidden component involves the planetary physics that has been carefully \nhidden from the public, or, when that fails, the data so hopelessly obfuscated that any mathematical or physical calculation becomes \nproblematic, since it is dependent on the already obfuscated data released by the space agencies. \n\nThis also implies the prospect that at some level there may exist a hidden technology at work. The television footage of the LEM \ntakeoffs from the Moon, which this author believes to be genuine and not hoaxed, suggest one of two things: first, the standard \nexplanation: a rocket lift-off from a low gravity surface, with a barely visible flame plume because of the vacuum. Or it may \nrepresent the possibility of the existence of an exotic propulsion technology. The relative lack of an exhaust plume, plus the almost \nsteady rate of ascent might point to the existence of a very different means of getting off the moon than we have been told. \n\n\n\n8. Possible Entities and Requisites for Coordination \n\n\nThis picture raises yet another significant question: What entity or entities would be capable of coordinating such a massive \nventure and such an equally massive “public relations” campaign, including the suppression of alternative science and technologies \nand their covert development? If one excluded a high-level and very top secret diplomatic collusion between the United States and \nthe Soviet Union at least in the version of Bennett and Percy, then that still would not explain the other versions of the Hypothesis, \nthose of Hoagland, Lyne, or those who maintain NASA has suppressed significant facts about planetary geography. \n\nSo, if one views these various versions as somehow related, as disparate glimpses of the same two-track space program, again, \nwhat entity could possibly coordinate it all? \n\nTo answer that question, one must assume that such an entity have certain features: \n\n1. Adequate financial power and backing; \n\n2. An international base and extension both inside the West and the Soviet bloc; \n\n3. Adequate penetration at various decision-making levels in the USA’s and USSR’s space programs (and anyone else’s that \nmight come along); \n\n4. An ideological and heavy financial commitment to the development of off-the-books technologies; \n\n5. A thorough knowledge of the occult, ceremonial magic, and astrology, and the demonstrated willingness to schedule space \nmissions according to those occult parameters; \n\n6. An ideological commitment to the exploration and military exploitation of space; and finally, \n\n7. A willingness to resort to and the ability to use “active measures” to coerce compliance to its goals when necessary. \n\nSeen in this way, there really are only four possible entities in the world that posses various combinations of the above, and only one \nof them possesses all of them: \n\n1. International banking and finance; this group lacks only a clear and consistent connection with number 5 above. That is, a \nconsistent, demonstrable, and significant correlation to occult activity and practice;— \n\n2. International fraternities, such as the Masons; this group lacks only numbers 2 and 3 above, since the extent of its activities \nbehind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War is largely unknown; \n\n3. The Vatican', certainly not lacking in international extent, financial power or knowledge of esoteric doctrines, this entity \nobviously lacks only numbers 6 and 7 above; \n\n4. The Nazi International, this is the only entity that exhibits significant measures of possession of all the above characteristics, \nthough it should be pointed out that the Soviets repatriated most German scientists by 1954, and that the KGB was - as far as \nis known - relatively successful in infiltrating the Gehlenorg’s Eastern European networks and shutting many of them \ndown.— Nonetheless, the heavy reliance of the Soviet program initially does raise the remote prospect that recruiting may \nhave been done by the expatriate Germans while working inside the Soviet Union. \n\nSeen in this way, it becomes a remote possibility that one of the key assignments of the post-war “Nazi International” was precisely \nthe hidden coordination of that part of the space programs of the USSR and USA visible to the public. A means of corroborating this \nhypothesis will be to see if there is any indication that wartime research begun by the Nazis was continued by them for a period after \nthe war, and to see if this research was carried out in apparent conjunction either with the US or with USSR’s space programs, or in \nconjunction with both. \n\nBut if there are two space programs and if there is a suppressed physics and technology, all of which dating from the Second \nWorld War and in some sense stemming from it, then what might that physics and technology be?

S. Government knows the origin of the more extraordinary saucers, that it is frightened of what the capability of those saucers might \nrepresent in military and political terms, and that its building of its own saucers is a race against time and its secrecy a means of avoiding national panic. ’ \n\n\" ‘The Canadian government has flying saucers. The U.S. government has flying saucers. But someone, somewhere, has flying saucers so advanced we can’t touch \nthem. Those saucers don’t come from space. They aren’t figments of imagination.

Igor Witkowski on the Bell \n\n\nIt is due to the research efforts of Polish military journalist Igor Witkowski, and the best-selling book by British author Nick Cook, \nThe Hunt for Zero Point, that anything at all is known of the Bell. And until the publication of Witkowski’s The Truth About the \nWunderwaffe, Nick Cook’s book was the only book in the English language that contained any information at all on the Bell, \nsummarizing Witkowski’s years’ of investigation.— With the publication of Witkowski’s research in English, however, one is in a \nposition to see why the Bell was given the Third Reich’s highest classification. Indeed, one can see why some may have resorted to \na program of murder to protect its secrets. \n\nTo appreciate this object’s true significance, however, it is necessary to understand what it was, what it did, what the physics \nbehind it may have been, and, thereby, what the Germans were possibly hoping to achieve with it. We will begin with a survey of \nWitkowski’s research and his own speculative reconstruction of the Bell’s operating principles in this chapter, and on the basis of his \nand other evidence, offer our own reconstruction and speculations of its possible significance and theoretical basis. \n\n\n1. The Significance of the Story of the Bell \n\n\nBefore proceeding to summarize Witkowski’s lengthy and weighty research in his chapter on the Bell from his book on German \nsecret weapons, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, a word is necessary about its significance. \n\nAs is well known to UFOlogists, the “Nazi Legend” of UFO origins has been around since the end of the Second World War and \nthe publication afterward of Major Rudolf Lusar’s book on German secret weapons, where the first brief mention is made of the \nsubject, accompanied by the first “schematic” of an alleged “suction-type” German saucer. As many have pointed out, the story rests \non few sources, which, when traced back, seem to lead nowhere, except to those sources’ own questionable connections, \nassociations, and agendas. \n\nWith Witkowski’s research on the Bell, however, one has something entirely different. The story is significantly different from the \nstories surrounding the “Nazi legend” and its familiar names of Habermol, Miethe, Schriever, Epp, Schauberger and so on. With the \nBell story, one has, as will be seen, clear descriptions of its design, mode of operation, and effects , as well as clear indications of \nknown personnel involved with the project and clear corroborative evidence in the form of installations and residual physical \nsignatures. \n\nTo put it succinctly, the story of the Bell is the actual probable basis of the Nazi UFO legend. \n\n\n\n2. An Obvious Question and a Not So Obvious Answer \n\n\nFor Witkowski, the investigation all began in August of 1997, when he was asked a very obvious question, a question that in fact \nhovers over every author who has ever investigated the mystery of wartime Nazi secret weapons research: Just exactly what was the \nso-called “Wonder Weapon”, or Wunderwaffe? For Witkowski, the journey began when a Polish intelligence officer, who had \naccess to Polish government documents regarding Nazi secret weapons, first made him aware of the Bell. \n\nAmong other things he asked me if I had ever come into contact with a device developed by the Germans, which was code- \nnamed “the Bell”, and made a sketch of it. On a circular base was some kind of bell jar, cylindrical in shape with a semicircular \ncap and hook, or some other clamping device at the top. The Bell jar was supposed to be made of a ceramic material, \nresembling a high voltage insulator. Two metal cylinders or drums were located inside.— \n\nNothing about the description of the object aroused any interest in Witkowski, but he could not let the subject drop, since the \nindividual who had approached him impressed him with his knowledge. “This was no amateur living in a dream world. Of that I \nwas sure.”— \n\nBut what had really piqued Witkowski’s interest were the individual’s descriptions of the Bell’s “quite simply unearthly effects” \nwhen it was in operation, effects that conjured in Witkowski’s mind the final scene from Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, \neffects that were “absolutely shocking.”— This description, plus the man’s evident sincerity and expertise, made the question he \nasked Witkowski even more significant: \n\n(He) asked me the outright disarming yet seemingly trivial question: if I was able to state with full responsibility that the \n“Wunderwaffe” - that “wonder weapon”, was the V-l or V-2, as was often mentioned. If in any German documents or in any \noriginal sources in general, I had come across information unraveling what the “Wunderwaffe” was. He stated that after all it \ncould not have referred to the V-l or V-2, since firstly these weapons had been from a military point of view not very effective \n(and therefore not “wonder”) and secondly that the term “Wunderwaffe” had begun to appear in earnest already after the “V” \nWeapons had been deployed in combat. This was indeed intriguing. Later from the point of view of this, I looked over various \nvolumes from my library and in actual fact it appeared that some kind of unusual weapon had existed, practically unknown till \nthis day.— \n\nIn other words, Witkowski had come across one component of the Allied Legend - that the Wunderwaffe referred to the V-l, V-2 \nand various other rocket projects of Nazi Germany - and to nothing more. \n\nBut the historical record suggested otherwise, as Witkowski notes; the term Wunderwaffe clearly began to be applied by the Nazis \nto something that was not any kind of rocket, even if that something was only a figment of Dr. Gobbels’ Propaganda Ministry. But \nthe uniqueness of the Bell and the revelations of the intelligence man continued to preoccupy Witkowski: \n\nMy aforementioned informer strongly emphasized that what was involved was a uniquely classified project, the most secret \nresearch project ever realized in the Third Reich! Therefore it is surely clear that regardless of the scale of difficulty it was \nworth verifying such a statement.— \n\nIn other words, beyond atom bombs, hydrogen bombs, fuel air bombs, advanced rockets, stealth materials, guided missiles, sound \ncannon, wind and vortex cannon, electromagnetic railguns, laser beams, nuclear powered aircraft, and all the other exotic weapons \ntechnology the Nazis were developing, there was one project so important in its scope and terrible promise that it - as will soon be \nseen - merited its own unique classification, and that project was the Bell. \n\nWitkowski began to research the story, and uncovered what is perhaps the most important story to come out of World War Two. \n\n\n3. The Personnel and a New SS Player on the Scene: the Forschungen, Entwicklungen, Patente \n\n\nWhen Witkowski was able to assemble at least a partial list of scientists and military personnel involved with the project, a very \nodd picture emerged. To appreciate the oddity of the picture, one must examine each of the individuals Witkowski uncovered in their \nturn. \n\n\na. SS Obergruppenfiihrer Emil Mazuw \n\nWitkowski was quickly led to the SS, and to one of its departments that was responsible for vetting patents in the Third Reich, and \nclassifying those that seemed to possess potential for further development: \n\nThe whole project was co-ordinated by a special cell co-operating with the SS armament office, subordinate to the Waffen-SS. \nThis cell was designated “FEP”, which was an abbreviation of the words “Forschungen, Entwicklungen, Patente” - research, \ndevelopment work, patents. The chief of this “FEP” cell was a certain Admiral Rhein, while the described project was co¬ \nordinated by a quite mysterious individual - namely SS-Obergruppenfiihrer (Four Star General) Emil Mazuw. Why mysterious? \nSimply because despite possessing one of the highest general’s ranks in the SS, practically nothing is known about him. I got \nhold of his dossier in the USA in 1999, but through this he became in my eyes an even more obscure figure. It followed both \nfrom his dossier as well as cards from the course of his service, that Mazuw had been at the very top of the SS elite. He was \npromoted to the rank of SS Obergruppenfiihrer on 20 April 1942, in other words he had possessed the highest possible SS rank \nat that time (in 1944 the SS Oberstgruppenfiihrer rank was further established, four people being promoted to it). He was \nawarded with the Honorary saber of Reichsfiihrer SS (Ehrendengen des RFSS) and honorary SS ring with skull and cross- \nbones (SS Totenkopfring). Such a ring was given by Himmler for special service to the organization. Their bearers constituted \nthe highest caste of SS-men, given admittance to the greatest secrets. Each ring was personally dedicated by Himmler....Mazuw \nalready had it in 1936. He was therefore one of the powers behind the throne of the Third Reich, almost unknown to this \nday.— \n\nWhat is interesting here in the light of my own, and other’s, previous research into the secret weapons think tank of SS \nObergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler’s, is that the Bell project appears to be under the mysterious “F.E.P.”, which in turn is under an \nAdmiral, implying a Kriegsmarine connection with whatever exotic technology and physics the Bell represented. The significance \nof this fact will be examined below. \n\n\nSS Obergruppenfiihrer Emil Mazuw Picture from Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe \n\n\n\nA second unusual feature of Witkowski’s revelations is that the Bell project itself was not directly coordinated by Kammler, but \nby the enigmatic Emil Mazuw, though, as Nick Cook and Witkowski both indicate, Kammler’s connection with the project was \ndirect, since he seems to have been involved in Bormann’s secret “evacuation command” structure that was apparently used to fly \nthe Bell, scientific papers, and perhaps Kammler himself, out of Europe at the war’s end.— \n\nWitkowski, in answer to a personal correspondence from me, explained the odd relationship of the F.E.P. to the Kammlerstab and \nother agencies in the following way: \n\nAs far as I know, Mazuw wasn’t tied with the Ahnenerbe. The situation was such that apart from Kammler’s office \n(Riistungsstab) - which, what has to be emphasized, wasn’t directly responsible for the R&D activities as such but for \narmaments projects in general, there were “specialized” R&D authorities within the SS (the best proof that they were really \nimportant is that it would be virtually impossible to find anything in the literature about it... It was: the “R&D group” at the \narmament office of the Waffen-SS, headed by SS-Brigadefiihrer Heinrich Gartner and the second was the FEPAVaffen-SS cell, \nheaded by Mazuw...it was theoretically responsible for the protection of inventions in the period when the normal patent law \nwas effectively suspended.— \n\nNote that this conflicts with the story of the Kammlerstab first broken by British journalist Tom Agoston, as recounted in my Reich \nof the Black Sun.— Agoston, relying on the confidential statements of former German weapons expert Dr. Wilhelm Voss, clearly \nimplied that it was Kammler himself, plus his “think tank” staff inside of the engineering division at the Skoda Works in Pilsen, \nCzechoslovakia, that headed research and development. But this may only be an apparent contradiction. At the rarefied levels of SS \nObergruppenfiihrers, contact between Mazuw and Kammler - both involved in sensitive black projects - would have been \ninevitable. And we know for certain that Kammler himself was in charge of Bormann’s special evacuation command at the end of \nthe war, the command which it appears successfully evacuated the Bell from Lower Silesia via a Junkers 390, about which more in a \nmoment. \n\nBut what of Witkowski’s statement that he knew of no direct or known association of Mazuw with the SS‘ “occult bureau”, the \nAhnenerbedienst? The answer, as in Kammler’s case, must be speculative. However, given that, at its highest level, Himmler \nintended for his SS to be a kind of “black knights of the round table”, and given that his chosen twelve “black knights” with access \nto the “SS occult center” at the castle of Wewelsburg had to be of at least Gruppenfuhrer (general) rank, then again, it would seem \nunlikely that Mazuw did not know of the SS’ occult activities and interests. \n\nThat a four star SS general, about whom almost nothing is known, is not only involved with the Bell project, but actually the \noverall director of it, raises as many questions as it answers. Did he, like Kammler, disappear into the bowels of some Allied \ncountry’s post-war classified projects or perhaps - an equal possibility - simply disappear, to continue the project independently? \n\n\nAnd the presence of a navy Admiral in the parent organization, the F.E.P., raises a further question: why the indirect connection to \nthe German navy? Does this relationship perhaps indicate something about the nature of the Bell itself? \n\n\nb. Prof Dr Walther Gerlach \n\n\nUnlike Emil Mazuw, Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach was and is quite famous, and for any number of reasons. As Nick Cook noted in \nhis Hunt for Zero Point, Gerlach was a Nobel laureate for his work in spin polarization. A first class physicist, Gerlach went on to \nspecialize in gravitational physics, on the basis of his pioneering experiment— that earned him the Nobel prize. But as any \nresearcher of the German atom bomb project knows, Gerlach was also nominally the head of atom bomb research in Nazi Germany \nby war’s end, and was one of the scientists interred by the British at Farm Hall in England, where the scientists’ conversations were \nsecretly recorded. \n\nGerlach was also expert in two other obscure topics, both of which, as we shall see, are closely associated with the Bell: the \ntransmutation of elements, and the “fluorescence of mercury ions in a strong magnetic field, in other words, referring to the \nbehaviour of mercuric plasma.” Gerlach had evidently been involved in the topic “for a long time, because as far back as January \n1925 he wrote to Arnold Sommerfeld about the spin...of ionized mercury.” In such matters, Gerlach was ’’faultlessly well-informed.” \n\n279 \n\nEven more mysteriously, Gerlach, one of the world’s premier gravitational physicists before the war, never returned to the subject \nafter the war. Nick Cook comments in his well-known book The Hunt for Zero Point that Gerlach thus acted as if “something had \nscared him beyond all reason.”— While Cook meant his comment in a speculative sense, there is perhaps some truth to it. If he was \ngenuinely frightened, and if this is the reason for his curious post-war silence about spin polarization and gravitation, then this could \nbe due to two causes. \n\nFirst, as the lead scientist involved with the Bell project, and as a loyal Nazi, Gerlach would have been privy to the curious and \nstrange results of the Bell’s operation and possibly have even personally witnessed some of these effects. As we shall see, these \neffects would have frightened any rational human. So, one explanation - the one that seems to be implied by Nick Cook, in fact - is \nthat Gerlach saw or witoessed something in the very project he headed that had frightened him into post-war silence. \n\nBut there is a second, and I think, more plausible explanation for Gerlach’s apparent fright-into-silence. Indeed, it is an \nexplanation that would seem to give a factual basis to Cook’s speculation that Gerlach was “frightened” into post-war silence on \nthese admittedly esoteric topics. As Cook himself notes, following Witkowski’s research, the SS shot the sixty-some scientists and \ntheir assistants who worked on the project, rather than let any of them fall into Allied or Russian hands.— As we shall see, there \nappear to be only a few scientists, two of them well-known in their way, that survived the SS’ massacre: one was Kurt Debus (about \nwhom more below), and the other was Walther Gerlach. \n\nThis allows us to undertake something of a reconstruction, speculative though it will have to be. First, it would appear that the SS, \nby murdering the project’s scientists with the exception of Debus, Gerlach (and one must assume, possibly others), is intent on \npreserving the project’s independence by preventing its secrets from falling into any Allied hands. That this is the most rational \nconclusion is evident from the fact that if the SS had bargained with the Allies or Soviets to exchange this project in return for their \nlives, then the process would be self-defeating, if the Soviets or Allies were denied the very technicians that made the project \npossible. Such scientists and technicians would have been in the Soviet’s or Allies’ “intelligence targets acquisitions and booty” list, \nso to speak. By its actions, in other words, the SS is clearly signaling that it has no intention of letting the project fall into Soviet \nhands, and it is equally possible that it has no intention of letting it fall into Allied hands either.— \n\nSo why did Gerlach and Debus escape? They escaped simply because of their sheer notoriety and value to the project.— For the \nSS to have murdered these men, and dumped them unceremoniously into an unmarked mass grave in Silesia, would have inevitably \n\nattracted Allied and Russian interest.and questions, after the war. And those questions, in turn, would have inevitably led back to \n\nthe Bell. Gerlach and Debus, moreover, represented a level of expertise and involvement beyond the mere day-to-day testing and \nexperimentation involved in the project. Gerlach, in particular, was the theoretician, capable of formulating the “big picture” of \nwhatever it was the Nazis had discovered with the Bell. Such men would be needed after the war if the project were to be continued \nand advanced. Indeed, as will be seen later in this chapter, it may have been Gerlach or someone in his close circle of friends and \nassociates in the physics community, that initiated the Bell project. \n\nSo what frightened Gerlach? Very simply: perhaps the SS “allowed” Gerlach and Debus - and any other big name scientist that \nmight have been involved with the project - to witness the executions of their comrades. Or perhaps the SS communicated their fates \nto Debus and Gerlach in some other fashion. In either case, the message was clear: “keep quiet on this subject, and keep \ncooperating.” If that was the message to the two men, then it certainly worked, for Gerlach never even intimated in the Farm Hall \n\n\n\nTranscripts of his involvement with any project during the war that involved his specialty: gravitation. — And as for Kurt Debus, he \napparently never mentioned the more exotic technologies to his new employer after the war, as we shall see below. In any case, I \nbelieve the SS murders of the Bell’s scientists are the best explanation for Nick Cook’s observation that Gerlach never touched the \nsubject of spin polarization and gravity after the war, acting as if “something had scared him beyond all reason.” \n\nProf. Dr. Walther Gerlach at Farm Hall \n\n\n\nc. The Mysterious Dr. Elizabeth Adler \n\n\nSo far, we have encountered in Witkowski’s list of Bell personnel two rather well-known scientists, and one very obscure four \nstar SS general. But there is yet another expert involved, and here, one is confronted again with something of a mystery: \n\nWithin the context of one of the people (involved in the project) the problem of “a simulation of damping of vibrations towards \nthe centre of spherical objects” appeared. In this case it concerned Dr Elizabeth Adler, a mathematician from Konigsberg \nUniversity (this name appeared only once).— \n\nWho was Dr Elizabeth Adler? What was her specialty in mathematics? No one seems to know. My own attempts to find out by \ncontacting the University of Kaliningrad, modem day Konigsberg, ended in a wall of stony silence. \n\nBut her presence - even if she is only mentioned in connection with the Bell once - is in itself a significant indicator of something. \nSince Gerlach was himself a capable mathematician and theoretical physicist, Adler’s presence must indicate a very rarefied form of \nmathematical expertise was required at some point. This in turn means that the Bell represented no ordinary project. For the SS to \nhave apparently “consulted” a mathematician outside the project must indicate that Elizabeth Adler’s mathematical skills were \nunique. Find her area of mathematical expertise, and one will have a significant clue into the nature of the physics that the Germans \nwere investigating with the Bell. \n\n\nd. Otto Ambros of Auschwitz „Buna” Fame \n\n\nAs if this list of personnel was not already strange enough, Witkowski, in the same context in which he mentions the involvement \nof Dr. Elizabeth Adler, then recounts how another name, again one well-known and somewhat imfamous, was involved at some \nstage in the project: \n\nIn descriptions of “the Bell’s” effect on living organisms on the other hand the notion of “ambrosism” (“Ambrosismus”) \noccurred. This was perhaps invented to honour one of the scientists, who admittedly was not a member of the research team, \nbut was in some sense connected with the whole project. It concerned Dr Otto Ambros - then chairman of the so-called “S” \ncommittee, responsible for chemical warfare preparations in Speer’s Armament Ministry. \n\nI must admit that from the beginning the plot connected to Ambros was totally belittled by myself, as not matching the whole \npicture. As it was to become evident a few years later, this was a big mistake - although there was never any doubt that \nchemical weapons were not responsible for “the Bell’s” operation, or any kind of chemical agent.— \n\nThis is the same Otto Ambros that was also appointed by I.G. Farben director Karl Krauch to oversee the construction and operation \nof its huge “Buna” synthetic rubber plants at Auschwitz, a plant that Carter Plymton Hyrick has quite persuasively argued was not a \nBuna plant at all, but a huge uranium enrichment facility.— Thus, while Witkowski does not seem to be aware of the state of recent \nGerman and American research into the actual state of German A-bomb development, his mention of Ambros in this context is for \nthat very reason all the more significant. \n\nIf Ambros was intimately involved with the SS in the enrichment of uranium, and presumably in the recovery of other exotic \nisotopes, then he would certainly be involved in the Bell project if any aspect of that project required the use of radioactive isotopes. \nThis last condition, radioactive isotopes, I believe is one of the significant clues into the nature of the device and what the Germans \nwere hoping to accomplish with it, as will be seen subsequently in this and later chapters. The fact that his position at the Farben \n“Buna” plant also placed him in the orbit of secret SS research and security jurisdiction of the Auschwitz camps is also another \nconnection that would seem to corroborate Witkowski’s revelations that Ambrose was somehow involved with the Bell project. \n\nDr. Kurt Debus’ POW Card \n\n\n\ne. Dr. Kurt Debus \n\n\nDebus and Von Braun at NASA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the standpoint not only of the various scientific disciplines but also from that of the various post-war relationships and \nthemes explored here, Dr. Kurt Debus is the most interesting big name scientist allegedly involved with the Bell, not the least \nbecause he is one of the high profile scientists brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. Due to this fact, Debus is \nalso perhaps an indicator that if any of the Allied powers became privy to the secrets of the Bell, then it most likely was the United \nStates, since Debus, curiously, became a director of the Kennedy Space Flight center at Cape Canaveral! \n\nDebus’ involvement with the Bell project is made the more curious because of the fact that he was intimately involved with the \nPeenemiinde team of Wehmer Von Braun and, as has been mentioned, continued to be deeply involved with post-war rocket \nprojects in his sensitive position in America’s space program. So what, then, is a rocket scientist doing in a project like the Bell? \n\nAccording to Witkowski’s meticulous research, Debus was not a rocket scientist at all, but rather, was interested in the extremely \navante garde notion (even for today) of magnetic fields separation. \" Moreover, he had apparently designed the power supply for \nthe Bell. \n\nHis parent institution was the institute of High Voltages at Darmstadt Polytechnic (Technische Hochschule). In 1942 he was \ntransferred to the research institute of the AEG consortium in Berlin - Reinickendorf, in addition he also co-operated with the \ncentre in Peenemiinde. He was the author of several publication and patents regarding high voltage measurement technology. \nHe developed among other things instruments for high pressure measurement and high voltage discharge parameters \nmeasurement. At the AEG research institute he constructed a power supply unit, supplying over 1 million volts current and \ntook part in the equipping of a supersonic wind tunnel. He also took part in the development of measurement instruments for \nthe V-2 test launch pads.— \n\nNeedless to say, such interests would not only have made Debus an invaluable contributor to the Nazi rocket program, but more \nimportantly, such experience in the measurement of high voltage discharge parameters would have made him an expert in \nphenomena of a wholly different nature, a phenomena that one might qualify under the broad label of “Teslian.” \n\nBut it was Debus’ character as a loyal Nazi, much like Gerlach, that led Witkowski to discover and corroborate one of his \n\n\n\ninformer’s crucial pieces of information: that the Bell was considered to hold such potential that it was given its own unique \nclassification among all the Third Reich’s admittedly exotic secret weapons projects. Debus, according to Witkowski, had informed \non one of his co-workers at AEG, one Richard Cramer, to the Gestapo, in 1942. Cramer was sentenced to two years in prison. \n\nBut Cramer was apparently no ordinary German, much less an ordinary engineer, for the chairman of the AEG Research Institute, \nProf Dr. Carl Wilhelm Ransauer, wrote a letter to the Gestapo: \n\nMr. Engineer R. Cramer from the AEG transformers factory in Oberschoneweide is developing together with the AEG \nResearch Institute a project concerning high voltages (Hochspannungsprojekt), which was contracted to AEG by the Ground \nForces Armament Office (Heereswaffenamt) and is being realized under the code-name “Charite-Anlage”, as a secret device \nimportant for the war. The realization of this project is in half dependent on Mr. Cramer, who as the sole employee of AEG \npossesses necessary qualifications, concerning this special field of electricity. Without the co-operation of Mr. Cramer further \nrealization of this project is not possible. The research and development work must be carried out with full energy, at least until \nthe end of the war. \n\nThe “important for the war” or “decisive for the war” importance of this project results from the following issues: \n\n1. The project is realized under special priority SS/1040, which is only granted in special cases. \n\n2. Mr. Ministerial Director Prof. Dr. E. Schumann, director of the Research Division of the Ground Forces Armament \nOffice has granted this project the highest level of urgency, which has been described as “decisive for the war” \n(compare the protocol from the briefing of 21.07.42, which may be submitted upon request). \n\n3. The Plenipotentiary of the Marshal of the Reich for Nuclear Physics, councilor of State Prof. Dr. A. Esay, President of \nthe Physical-Technical Reich’s Office (Physicalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt)... has explained the signing below, that \nin addition he will prove the necessity of carrying out this work in the interest of the war.— \n\n\nThus, were it not for Debus’ ardent Nazism and denunciation of Cramer, one would never have known even of the existence of the \nclassification “decisive for the war,” or Kriegsentscheidend, at all. \n\n\n(1) “Kriegsentscheidend ” \n\n\nAs for the term Kriegsentscheidend , Witkowski notes that this term was highly unusual. While the term “important for the war” \n(Kriegswichtig) was a technical term implying a lifting of administrative restrictions in order to procure necessary war material,— the \nterm “decisive for the war” (Kriegsentscheidend) occurs only in this document and only in connection with whatever research the \nA.E.G., Dr. Debus, and Mr. Cramer, were conducting. Witkowski notes that he “personally analyzed in depth cubic meters of \nGerman documentation referring to technology and never came across this term in a different context - as an official designation of \nany other research project or activity.”— \n\nWhat is significant in this context, however, is the fact that none other than Martin Bormann, whenever he corresponded with \nGerlach, mentioned the Wunderwaffe.— Gerlach also wrote Bormann at the end of 1944 that the project on which he was working \nwould be “decisive for the war!”— But most importantly, Witkowski uncovered the work of a Polish historian, Herbert Lipinski, \nwho had some access to the Farm Hall Transcripts in their pre-declassification form. From Limpinski’s descriptions of the \ntranscripts, as compared to their “public consumption” declassified version, “something completely different followed” whenever \nGerlach was present and the subject of conversation turned to physics. For “the topics of conversations were most often: ‘atomic \nnuclei’, ‘extraterrestrial space’, ‘magnetic fields’ and ‘the earth’s gravitation.’”— Clearly, Gerlach and Company were involved in \nsomething more rarefied than mere atom bombs. \n\nDebus’ involvement with the Bell raises yet another disturbing series of questions. What was such an ardent Nazi doing as a \ndirector of the Kennedy Space Flight center in Cape Canaveral, a post which he was appointed to in 1963? And why would he even \nbe interested in mere rockets when the Bell held so much more potential not only for propulsion, but for so many other things? Why \ndid someone, whose expertise was in the distinctively Tesla field of high voltage electricity discharge measurement, not only find \nhimself involved both in the semi-secret V-2 program and the much more secret Bell project during the war, but after the war why \nwas this electrical engineer involved as a director of the Kennedy Space center? \n\n\n4. Dr. Hermann Oberth Takes a Trip with some Friends \n\n\nDr. Kurt Debus is not, however, the only Nazi “rocket” scientist who was involved with the Bell. Another is the well-known Dr. \nHermann Oberth, who, like the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and American Robert Goddard, is one of the three founding fathers \nof modem rocketry. Oberth’s involvement remains a mystery, for some time between September 15 th and September 25 th 1944 he \napparently took a “business trip,” along with other “Bell” project scientists Herbert Jensen, Edward Tholen, and the enigmatic Dr. \nElizabeth Adler, from Prague, to Breslau, and eventually to the region where the Bell itself was being tested.— Of course, readers \nfamiliar with Tom Agoston’s work on the Kammlerstab,— or with my previous book on Kammler’s super-secret black projects \n“think tank.”— will recognize immediately the significance of Prague as the home of a number of Nazi secret weapons projects, and \nits significance for its close proximity to the headquarters of Kammler’s secret weapons “think tank” at the Skoda Works in Pilsen. \nAnd readers familiar with the “Nazi Legend” of the UFO will likewise immediately recognize Breslau as the home of the alleged \nsecret “flying saucer” research being conducted there. So it is indeed curious, from a prima facie standpoint alone, that Oberth, a \nrelatively well-known figure, should be accompanying an obscure mathematician whose specialty is unknown, and two other \nscientists of relative obscurity, on what is apparently a “fact-finding” mission to the centers of the Third Reich’s most sensitive - and \nstill unknown - secret weapons projects! \n\nBut Witkowski’s commentary on Oberth’s involvement is perhaps even more unsettling: \n\nLike earlier in the case of professor Gerlach this information reveals to us a certain unusual and significant fact - significant for \nthe work being carried out. Namely that in principle it is unknown what Prof. Oberth was engaged in during the war. One \ncould have the impression that this is some kind of light at the end of the tunnel, which until now has been cloaked in the \ndarkness of night. After all it is known for sure that Oberth was not connected with the centre in Peenemiinde, since in this case \nhe would have undoubtedly held at least one of the positions of command, in other words the fact of his engagement would \nhave been known (thousands of specialists employed there worked after the war in other countries, from the USA and USSR to \neven Egypt and so is out of the question that a possible secret of this kind could not be kept hidden). So it seems that some kind \nof alternative program had existed, being carried out for a long time, and quite a serious one at that.— \n\nThat is, Oberth’s presence on this trip, particularly in the company of the mysterious Dr. Elizabeth Adler, whose only known \nconnection to German secret weapons projects is to the Bell, implies the presence already in Nazi Germany of two “space” \nprograms, the one for “public consumption” represented by the V- 2 and various other rocket projects, and the other, represented by \nthe Bell. Oberth was perhaps the world’s then-leading theoretician of the problems and solutions for long term manned space flight. \nHis presence in the circle of scientists involved with the Bell, such as Dr. Adler, Dr. Gerlach, and Dr. Debus, is yet another clue as \nto the possible principles of its operation and the possible purpose of the project. \n\nWe may summarize the possible clues represented by these individuals and organizational relationships surveyed by Witkowski as \nfollows: \n\n\nIndividual or Organization \nF.E.P. \n\n“Admiral Rhein” \n\nA. E ,G.( A Ugemeine Elektricitdts \nGesellschaft) and the HWA \n(Heeres wajfenaml) \n\nSS Obergruppenfuhrer Emil \nMazuw \n\n\nArea of Expertise \n\nPatents Research and Develop- \n\nMent \n\nConnection to the Kriegsmarine \nHigh Voltage High Frequency \nResearch. Army Ordnance \nBureau \n\nSecurity??? Ahnenerbe connect¬ \nion??? \n\n\nProf Dr. Walther Gcrlach \n\n\nSpin Polarization, Magnetism \nGravity \n\nDr. Kurt Debus High Voltage Discharge \n\nParameters and Measurement. \nHigh Voltage Power Supply \nDr. Elizabeth Adler Mathematician (specialty un¬ \n\nknown) Unis. of Kbnigsberg \n\nDr. Hermann Oberth Space Might Theorist and \n\nRocket Engineer \n\n\nFrom this list of personnel and their known areas of expertise and research preoccupations, it is fairly easy to draw the conclusion \nthat the Bell may have represented some revolutionary prototypical device for very advanced space flight propulsion that was not \nbased on the inefficient reaction-driven chemical rockets. Indeed, such an interpretation would explain the nominal though tacit \ninvolvement of the German navy, for manned spaceflight would require the construction of pressure vessels for outer space flight \nthat would entail similar types of expertise as used in the construction of submarine pressure hulls. Additionally, the German navy \nwould clearly be interested in exotic propulsion for its U-boats, to allow them greater underwater cruising time as well as speeds. \n\nIn any case, the presence of Debus, A.E.G., and the Army Ordnance Bureau (Heereswaffenamt) that also hovers in the \nbackground would seem to indicate a more exclusively “ weapons ” preoccupation with the project. This indication, while mentioned \nby Witkowski, is, in my opinion, given rather too short shrift in favor of the “propulsion” explanation he seems to prefer. However, \nas the next two chapters will seek to demonstrate, one must not be too quick to dismiss this aspect of the project. \n\nIn any case, the interpretation of the Bell as a breakthrough “field propulsion” device of some sort is clearly the favored theory of \nBritish Jane’s Defense Weekly author and journalist, Nick Cook,— and the “propulsion” theory is clearly that favored and implied \nby Witkowski. \n\n\nB. The Operation of the Bell and Its Effects: Witkowski’s Reconstruction of the Bell \n\n\nIn outlining Witkowski’s presentation of the known operating parameters, construction parameters, and effects of the Bell, I shall \nattempt to be as thorough as possible in citation of his research, since much of what he says bears directly on my own admittedly \nmore speculative interpretations of some aspects of the Bell. In doing so, I maintain, in concert with Witkowski and Cook, that at a \nminimum the Bell represented such a breakthrough in “field propulsion,” but I maintain that the Bell represents much more than that. \nI believe that a propulsion breakthrough was the motivation of the project, but I also believe, that along the way and perhaps even \nnear the very beginning of the project before the full-sized “Bell” was built, that the Germans also encountered some un-anticipated \neffects that also became principal areas of investigation for the project. As I will attempt to show, in the light of contemporary models \nand experimentation, the Bell exhibits many hallmarks of a device deliberately designed to cohere or “tap into” the Zero Point \nEnergy, and of a device designed to do so not only for propulsion purposes, but for weaponization. It is thus best seen, perhaps, as a \nprototypical “scalar” device, a prototypical technology of an extremely unified physics. With this in mind, we turn now to \nWitkowski’s survey. \n\n\n\n1. Where it All Happened \n\n\nAccording to Witkowski, the principal laboratories for the work on the Bell were in Lower Silesia, in the town of Neumarkt \n(modem day Sroda Slaska), and Leubus (modem day Lubiaz), disguised inside the facility Schlesische Wekstdtten dr Fiirstenau. The \ncorporate backing was provided by A.E.G. ( Allgemeine Elekticitdts Gesellschaft) and the giant Siemens electrical firm.— \n\nYet another underground facility existed at the Schloss Fiirstenstein (Fiirstenstein Castle) in lower Silesia, as well as disguised in a \ncoal mine at Waldenburg, where the Bell may have been initially tested. \n\nCastle Fiirstenstein: Note the Hilly and Forested Terrain (From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\nA Wartime Tunnel Beneath Fiirstenstein Castle (From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe; Mr. Witkowski is \n\nVisible in the Picture) \n\n\nA little further away, there is another complex that is a part of the project, the Wenceslas Mine at Ludwigsdorf (modem day \nLudwikowize). Here in a very remote valley, again disguised in a coal mine, the SS built a rat’s run of tunnels, bunkers, and a very \nodd object that looks like a large concrete henge, self-evidently a test rig of some sort. \n\nThe “Henge” At Ludwigsdorf (Ludwikowice) (From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\nThis “henge” stands inside a pool or basin, around which there are ports for heavy electrical cabling. \n\n\n\n\n\nWitkow ski’s Sketch of The Henge in its Basin or Pool \n(From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\n\n\nWitkowski also provided this author with more information that was not available when his book was published. Rainer Karlsch, a \nGerman historian who recently published a book in Germany on Hitler’s nuclear program, also \n\nMentioned in his book that a team of physicists from a German university (in Giessen) has carried out a lot of research in \nLudwikowice—, namely in (the Henge). The result is such that there are isotopes in the construction (in the reinforcement), \nwhich can only be the result of irradiation by a strong beam of neutrons, thus that there must have been some kind of device \naccelerating ions, rather heavy ones. It could be calculated what was the intensity of the radiation in 1945 and generally it was \nvery high.— \n\nIn other words, whatever had been tested at the Henge - and there is every indication that it was the Bell - it not only required a \nsturdy structure to keep it down but also it gave off strong, heavy, radiation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The History and Code-Names of the Project \n\n\nWhile experiments on the Bell first appear to have been undertaken in May and June of 1944, — the project itself was conceived \nsome two and a half years earlier, meaning that it required that long to bring whatever theory that underwrote it to practical and \ntechnical manifestation. \n\nThe entire research project as such was created in January 1942 - under the code-name “Tor” (“Gate”), which functioned until \nAugust 1943. After this it was renamed or rather divided into two “sub-projects”. The code-name “Tor” was replaced by the \ncode-names: “Chronos” and “Latementrager”. Both referred to “the Bell”, but the project had been divided into physical and \nmedical-biological aspects. It was not established which code-name corresponded to a given aspect of the work. The system \npowering “the Bell” probably received the codename Charite-Anlage”.— \n\nThe code-names are suggestive, since “Chronos” means “time” in the Greek, and “gate” is suggestive enough. Both taken together \nsuggest that at least part of the intention behind the product was to engineer time. If so, it is another indicator that the Nazis had \nabandoned Special Relativity with its locally flat space. Indeed, they were perhaps experimenting in a kind of “hyper-relativity” or a \nlocally-engineered space-time curvature. The significance of the code names, then, points to a very radical and exotic physics, one \nthat, while based upon some of Witkowski’s speculations, far exceeds them. \n\nBut what of the other code-name, Latementrager? Literally, it means a “lantern bearer” or “lantern carrier,” i.e., the individual \nwho lit gas street lights in the era before electric lights and photovoltaic cells dispensed with the need for such lamp-lighters. But \nthere may be something more significant in the choice of this particular code-name, as Witkowski notes: “(One) can look at this from \nyet another angle. It could be, as it was suggested to me, a not too literal translation of a certain ancient name — the name of \n‘Lucifer’, i.e., ‘he who carries the light.’”— \n\nIn any case, the important points for our purposes are not only that the code-names may be indicative, at least in a general way, of \nthe exotic physics the project was to investigate, but also that the project was apparently underway for at least two years before a \npractical technology - the Bell itself - resulted. This implies a high degree of theoretical background work was its inspiration, and that \nin turn means we must investigate the clues very carefully in an attempt to reconstruct what that theoretical basis might have been. \n\n\n3. The Last Flight of the Ju 390 \n\n\nSo what happened to the Bell and its research team? As detailed in two of my previous books Reich of the Black Sun and The \nGiza Death Star Deployed, most of the scientists and technicians were murdered by the SS, and the project hardware itself was \nevacuated. Indeed, there is now strong evidence that “Project Lantern Bearer” (or if one prefer, Project Lucifer) was evacuated in \nApril of 1945 by a six-engine Junkers 390. This is intriguing, since one of the last pictures of the Junkers 390 was taken at \napproximately the same period at an airfield in Prague. Since at the end of the war there was only one Ju 390 left in existence, this \nmeans that it flew from Prague to near Ludwigsdorf (probably the aerodrome at Opole, in Poland), picked up its additional cargo \nthere, and then, according to an SS officer who was involved in the project and his interrogation records which Witkowski found in \nthe Berlin Document Center, it was flown to Bodo airbase in Norway, after which, like the Bell and General Hans Kammler, it \nsimply disappears.— \n\n\nThe Last Known Picture of a Ju 390, Coincidentally Taken in Prague in 1945. \n(From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\nIn Reich of the Black Sun I followed Nick Cook’s hypothesis that Kammler had not, in fact, died in Czechoslovakia at the end of \nthe war, but that he had either made his way into post-war America’s secret black projects along with the Bell as part of a \ncomprehensive bargain struck between the United States and various high ranking Nazis, including Martin Bormann, or that he \nsimply disappeared with it into an independently-run and continuing Nazi secret weapons project. \n\nWitkowski has uncovered certain circumstantial information that appears to corroborate the “American scenario.” Among the \nmany other scientists involved with the Bell, there was one Herbert Jensen, whom we have not mentioned until now. Jensen \naccompanied the well-known Hermann Oberth, and the very mysterious Elizabeth Adler, on their “business trip” from Prague to \nLower Silesia. Oberth and Jensen were some of the main “prizes” sought by the USA after the war, along with Kurt Debus. In other \nwords, behind the mad scramble to acquire the Peenemiinde rocket scientists and pry open the secrets of the Nazis’ atom bomb \nproject, a concerted effort also seems to have been underway to reassemble as much of the personnel as were involved in the Bell as \npossible.— Given the extremely secret nature of Project Lantern-Bearer, one must assume that the knowledge of the personnel \ninvolved with the project, as well as the knowledge of who escaped the SS’ execution of various scientists and technicians involved, \ncould only have come from within the SS itself. \n\nAs for Gerlach and Debus, we have already speculated that their high profiles perhaps saved them from the SS’ death squads. \nPerhaps this is also why Gerlach, having been thus “warned off’ the subject of spin polarization and gravity research, never publicly \nreturned to these subjects after the war. In this regard it is also noteworthy that Gerlach, after his internment by the British at Farm \nHall, was also the only Farm Hall scientist who was subsequently transferred to the United States for further intensive interrogation. \nIn my view it is extremely significant that his wartime work diaries were appropriated by the American OSS, where they remain \n\n\n\nclassified in the CIA archives. Almost nothing is known of their contents.— The fact that Gerlach was singled out for such \ninterrogation and that his wartime diaries were placed under tight classification speaks volumes. \n\nWitkowski also entertains the notion that the Ju 390, which was one of the first aircraft in the world equipped for mid-air \nreJueling,— a technique pioneered by the Luftwaffe, might have flown its contents to Argentina to continue its research \nindependently of the prying eyes of the Allies, and under the watchful protection of the Peron government. Indeed, Peron had built a \nmodem laboratory for some of the exiled German scientists for research into plasmas and high voltage at Bariloche.— \n\nUnlike Witkowski, Geoffrey Brooks unequivocally maintains that the Bell, General Kammler, and the missing Ju 390, made their \nway to Argentina and eventually to the plasma and high voltage laboratory at Bariloche as part of their super-secret strategic \nevacuation plans known as Operation Regentrdpfchen (Raindrop), in which the Gauleiter of Lower Silesia, Karl Hanke, played a \nsignificant role. In the light of Carter Hydrick’s thesis that Martin Bormann actually aided the United States in the surrender of the U- \n234 and its valuable cargo of fissile uranium and atom bomb components, Brooks’ remarks again underscore the significance and \nimportance as a “decisive war-winning weapon” that the Bell had for the Nazis: \n\nThe Nazis were particularly anxious to protect documents containing the highest classifications of secret knowledge designated \nGeheime Reichssache relating to the development of arms, aircraft and submarines. The most important of all these, files \nrelating to a super aviation fuel and advanced aircraft, went by long-range Junkers Ju 390 transport aircraft directly to \nArgentina. \n\nFrom the point of view of the US Government, the 260 tons of strategic material aboard the German U-boat U-234 escorted \ninto Portsmouth Navy Yard, New Hampshire, on 19 May 1945 is so absurdly secret that the fact that it is classified as top secret \nis a secret, as are the documents pertaining to Dr Heinz Schlicke and the nature of the assistance he afforded the Manhattan \nProject in the three months after his capture. The most secret item of cargo aboard U-234 remains the eighty small cases of \nuranium powder which have never appeared on any USN Unloading Manifest and which will have been the fissile material for \na rudimentary atomic explosive. But as far as the German High Command was concerned, the voyage of this U-boat with its \nextraordinary cargo of war materials and passengers did not rate so highly as to fall within the ambit of the General Plan of \nEvacuation.— \n\nAccording to Brooks, whose information in this regard corroborates Witkowski’s own discovery of the Bell’s classification as \nKriegsentscheidend, the Bell rated higher than the atom bomb in the German High Command’s estimation. While this may seem odd \nor unusual, it should be recalled that a similar classification scheme has been alleged for captured “UFO” technology in the post-war \nUSA, rating it higher than the hydrogen bomb. \n\nIn any case, Brooks then adds significant detail about the Bell in Argentina. \n\nA leftist correspondent of a leading Neuquen daily newspaper active in exposing Nazi war criminals in the Bariloche area of \nArgentina and who prefers anonymity for that reason has stated in writing that he inspected official documents confirming that \nthe German anti-gravity experiments SS-E-IV and SS-U-13, together with the notorious Bell... arrived aboard a Junkers Ju 390 \nlong-range transport aircraft which flew non-stop from Norway to Gualeguay aerodrome in Entre Rios province, Argentina, at \nthe war’s end. If true, this might be seen by some as suggestive that the SS anti-gravity aircraft project was the post-war utmost \npriority for the National Socialist scientific elite.— \n\nIf Brook’s scenario is correct, then it is sobering in its implications, for it indicates that an independent and on-going Nazi \ndevelopment of exotic weapons technologies continued after the war. As will be seen in the final chapters of this book, this prospect \nis chillingly corroborated in yet a different fashion. And it highlights the Two Space Programs Hypothesis in yet another fashion, for \n“one would also think it safe to assume that if the USAF had been able to make head or tail of German anti-gravity, they would not \nhave bothered with the same old rocket propulsion methods at Cape Kennedy three decades afterwards.”— Or perhaps, as was seen \nin the previous chapter, there was a space program within the space program, developing and utilizing an exotic technology, and \nwrapping it in rockets for show. \n\n\n4. The Design of the Bell and Its Effects in Operation \n\n\nWitkowski’s anonymous intelligence informant aroused enough interest in the Polish journalist in subject of what really \nconstituted the so-called Wunderwaffe that he began to search for references to it. The quest began with yet another characteristic \nstatement from Propaganda Minister Dr. Josef Gobbels relayed by his wife, Magda, to her sister-in-law. The Nazi propaganda \nminister, it seemed, had seen a weapon “so visionary” that it would guarantee ultimate victory.— Such statements were, of course, \nstandard fare for the beleaguered Reich. But Witkowski soon uncovered odd corroboration from another source, this time from the \naide to the well-known SS commando, Otto Skorzeny: Karl Radi. Radi disclosed, in documents Witkowski uncovered at the \nAmerican archives’ Berlin Document Center, that Skorzeny had engaged in numerous acts of sabotage behind Russian lines in 1944 \nbecause he had “come into contact with the ‘wonder weapon’ and as a result (had) ‘been possessed’ by the idea of ‘Sonderkampf’ \n(‘Special Warfare’), regarding the use of this weapon, to such an extent, that he considered it the only sure way to win the war.”— \nBut the matter did not rest there. \n\nAfter the war, according to reports in the Spanish press that were soon followed by similar articles in the American press, \nSkorzeny had attempted to sell the secrets of this unknown Wunderwaffe to the Americans. These articles “mentioned that among \nother things what was involved was some unusual flying object, with ‘electromagnetic’ propulsion, which simultaneously had been \n‘responsible for a wave of flying saucer observations over North America that summer. ”’412 The article went on to state that these \n“saucers” were built in Spain by exiled German scientists, and that their flight principle was based on the gyroscope.— \n\nHis curiosity now definitely piqued, Wikowski again arranged for further meetings with his anonymous informant. From these \nmeetings, the following picture of the Bell emerged: \n\nThat mysterious device - “the Bell” (“die Glocke”) seemed at first glance relatively simple, although the unusual effects of its \noperation contradicted this. The description was admittedly incomplete and non-scientific, since it had originated from military \npersonnel, who had not had access to all of the data, but even then it included, many valuable details. The main part of “the \nBell” was made up of two massive cylinders-drums around one meter in diameter, which during the experiment span in \nopposite directions at tremendous speeds. The drums were made of a silvery metal and rotated around a common axis. The \naxis was formed by quite an unusual core, with a diameter of a dozen or so, to twenty centimeters, with its lower end fixed to \n“the Bell’s” massive pedestal. It was made of a heavy, hard metal. Before each trial some kind of ceramic, oblong container \nwas placed in the core (it was defined as a “vacuum flask”...), surrounded by a layer of lead approx. 3 cm thick. It was approx. \n1-1.5 m long and filled with a strange, metallic substance, with a violet-gold hue and presen’ing at room temperature the \nconsistency of “slightly coagulated jelly”. From the produced information it followed that this substance was codenamed “IRR \nXER JJM-525 ” or ”IRR SER JJM-525 ” and contained among other constituents the thorium oxide and beryllium oxide \n(beryllia). The name “Xeron” also appeared in the documentation. It was some kind of amalgam of mercury, probably \ncontaining various heavy isotopes. \n\nMercury, this time already in pure form, was also present inside the spinning cylinders. Before the start of each experiments, \nand perhaps also for its duration, the Mercury was intensively cooled. Since information appeared about the use of large \nquantities of liquid gas — nitrogen and oxygen, it appeared that it was precisely these that were the cooling medium. The entire \ndevice, i.e., the cylinders and core was covered with the aforementioned ceramic housing, of a bell-like shape - a cylinder \nrounded at the top crowned with some kind of hook, or fastening. The entire device was about 1.5 m in diameter and about 2.5 \nm high.... \n\nThe person in conversation with me had in any case emphasized that not once had the term “weapon” been uttered in \nrelation to the described device.— \n\nAt this juncture, it is necessary to pause and consider the details, since they differ somewhat from Nick Cook’s summary of them in \nHunt for Zero Point and my own earlier descriptions in The Giza Death Star Deployed and Reich of the Black Sun. \n\nIgor Witkowski’s Sketch of the Bell \n(From The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\n1. The Bell consisted of \n\na. Two counter-rotating cylinders on a common axis, which cylinders were apparently filled with or coated with pure \nmercury; \n\nb. The axis itself consisted of a heavy metal core, presumably hollow, since it was the receptacle for the mysterious \nthorium-beryllium-mercury compound known as Xerum-525; — \n\nc. The outer casing was made of a ceramic material. \n\n2. . The mercury, and presumably the interior of the Bell, was tremendously cooled by (presumably liquid) nitrogen and \noxygen; \n\n3. The Bell was approximately (according to this latest research of Witkowski) 2.5 meters high (about eight to nine feet high) \nand about 1.5 meters in diameter (or about four to five feet), smaller in size than initially reported by Cook. \n\nThis last detail is perhaps significant, since I drew comparisons between the Bell and the UFO recovered at Kecksburg in my \nprevious book, Reich of the Black Sun. There, relying on Nick Cook’s dimensions of 12-15 feet high and 9-12 feet wide, and similar \ndimensions for the object that crashed at Kecksburg, I drew the speculative conclusion that they were perhaps one and the same \nobject. While the new dimensions tend to weaken this connection, I nevertheless maintain my speculations advanced in that book: \nthat it may have been the Bell or some such similar device that crashed at Kecksburg.— \n\nIn any case, the above list raises certain important questions: \n\n1. What was the purpose of the counter-rotating cylinders? \n\n2. Were these cylinders arranged one inside the other, or one on top of the other? \n\n3. What was the purpose of using mercury in these cylinders? \n\n4. What was the purpose of using the obviously radioactive compound of Xerum 525? Was Xerum 525 some isotope of \nmercury, or an isotope of mercury in compound with other elements? \n\n5. What was the purpose of the ceramic housing? \n\nAs will be seen, Witkowski has his own very plausible explanations for some of these questions. We will examine these in due \ncourse, and tender our own speculations as well. \n\nBut Witkowski’s meetings with his informant revealed much more information not only regarding the device itself, but its \nexperimental operation: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach such experiment was carried out in a specially prepared chamber - a pool. In most cases it was located underground. Its \nsurface was covered with ceramic tiles and the floor also with heavy rubber mats. The mats were destroyed after each test (!), \nwhile the tiles were washed - deactivated with a pink liquid resembling brine. In the case of tests conducted inside the chamber \nof an inactive mine, in 1945, such a chamber was always destroyed (blown up) after two-three tests.... \n\nFirst of all “the Bell” itself was prepared along with the considerable power supply installation accompanying it. A whole set \nof cameras, movie cameras and probably also some measuring devices were placed on a special rack in the research chamber \nitself. Then a series of samples or objects were placed nearby, on which the effect of the emitted energy was tested. These were \nanimal organisms (live lizards, rats, frogs, insects, snails and in all probability also....peopleprisoners from KL Gross- \nRosen) plants (mosses, ferns, horsetails, fungi, moulds) as well as a whole series of substances of organic origin such as: \nWhite of an egg, blood, meat, milk and liquid fats. These preparations were of course carried out by scientists and \ntechnicians...as well as by a commando of prisoners from Gross-Rosen concentration camp, specially assigned to this work. It \nnumbered up to 100 people.... Just before the experiment the entire personnel was removed to a distance of150-200 m, at the \nsame time employing individual, rubber protective suits and helmets or hard hats distinguished by large red visors.— \n\nThus, we may add to our previous list the following points: \n\n5. The experiments were conducted in an underground chamber, part of which consisted of a pool; \n\n6. The chamber was insulated with rubber mats covering ceramic bricks; \n\n7. The effects of the Bell during its operation extended some 650-700 feet beyond the device; \n\n8. The chambers had to be destroyed after only a few tests, due apparently to the strong residual effects of its operation; \n\n9. The effects of the device on living organisms and organic material was apparently a crucial area of inquiry; \n\n10. Even at some distance from the object, its technicians had to be in rubber suits (which suggests that they could not be \nelectrically grounded while the Bell was in operation); and, \n\n11. The eyes had to be protected with red visors. \n\nThe effects of the Bell when in operation lived up to this odd list of extreme precautions, giving off both “short-term and long¬ \nterm effects - and perhaps also those about which we do not know.”— With respect to the short-term effects, these \n\nbecame immediately perceptible after the power had been switched on. These were: a characteristic sound, which could be \ndescribed as something extremely similar to the humming of bees sealed in a bottle (hence the unofficial name “The Hive” - \n“Bienenstock” was also used in relation to “the Bell”) as well as a series of electromagnetic effects. These consisted of the \nfollowing: surges in surrounding 220 V electrical installations (bulbs “blowing”) observed in the case of ground tests at \ndistances exceeding 100 m, a bluish phosphorescence (blue glow) around “the Bell” - obviously a result of the emission of \nionizing radiation, as well as a very strong magnetic field mentioned in the statements. In addition participants of the \nexperiments felt disturbances or the nervous system’s operation, such as formication (“pins and needles”), headaches and a \nmetallic taste in the mouths.— \n\nClearly, the Bell’s operation induced some very odd, and very extreme effects, and as many readers will recognize, the “metallic \ntaste” in the mouths of participants is one characteristic associated with those who come into close proximity to UFOs. 52 \n\nThe long term effects were equally peculiar. Participants would suffer sleep loss, problems with their balance and equilibrium, \nmemory problems, muscle cramps and ulceration. The Germans apparently later “succeeded in radically limiting these unfavourable \neffects.”— \n\nBut it was the effect of its operation on organic materials that was the most peculiar, and deadly. The various plants, animals, and \npresumably hapless concentration camp victims suffered “various types” of damage, the most dominant form being “the \ndisintegration of tissue structures, gelation and the stratification of liquids (among others blood) into distinctly divided fractions and \nothers.”— In fact, during the first series of tests, apparently conducted from May to June of 1944, “these kinds of side-effects caused \nthe death of five out of seven scientists engaged in them. As a result, the whole first research team was dissolved,” and it became a \nhigh priority for the project to limit these effects.— In other words, the deadly effects of the Bell were not, at least initially, what the \nGermans were apparently after. Its purpose was something different. As we shall see subsequently though, such results and its \npotential for a deadly new type of weapon could not have been lost on the Germans. Indeed, while Witkowski tends toward the \nview that the Bell represented a secret project in propulsion of some sort, its classification as Kriegsentscheidend and its clear claim \nto the title of “Wunderwaffe” would seem to call for more speculation in this direction, based on Witkowski’s disclosures. We will \nreturn to this subject momentarily. \n\nThe oddest changes in organic materials “were observed in the case of green plants.” \n\n\nDuring the first phase, spanning about five hours after the test had been completed, the plants paled or became grey, suggesting \nchemical decomposition or the decay of chlorophyll. Extraordinary is that despite this, such a plant lived normally, by all \nappearances, for a further period - the order of a week. This was followed by immediate, almost rapid or cascade (8-14 hours) \ndecomposition to a greasy substance, “with the consistency of rancid fat,...enveloping the entire plant. This decomposition was \ndevoid of all features characteristic of bacterial decomposition - among other things of smell. Besides, it was too rapid, giving \nthe impression that all structure had decayed. \n\nAt the same time the formation of undefined crystalline structures was observed in the liquid organic substances....— \n\nFrom this one can surmise what had happened when the device was first used, causing the deaths of five of the scientists and \ntechnicians that ran it. Unwary, they were exposed to its unusual effects, and the cellular structure of their bodies and fluids broke \ndown completely. As we shall see, such effects are one clear signature of a “scalar” device. \n\nBut these were not the only strange effects associated with the Bell. In the region of Lower Silesia around Ludwigsdorf (modem \nday Ludwikowice) where the project was based, survivors from the project, or inhabitants of the area during the war, contacted \nWitkowski, and reporting seeing “objects vertically landing and taking off,” objects that some described as “flying barrels”.— \n\n\n5. Witkowski’s Reconstruction of its Possible Physics \n\n\nObviously, the above list of the device’s construction, its operation, and effects, paints a very unusual picture. What sort of physics \nlies behind all of it? What were the Germans attempting to accomplish with this bizarre device? Obviously, to have such a complex \ndevice in operation by the end of the war would have required some initial testing, planning and designing, taking years of research \nin its own right. So what were they looking for? What might have been the inspiration? And finally, why would such a device, \nbeyond all the other exotic weapons in the Third Reich’s arsenal - an arsenal that included fuel-air bombs, guided missiles, deadly \nchemical and nerve gases, and possibly even the atomic bomb — be uniquely classified as Kriegsentscheidend, as “decisive for the \nwar”? \n\nWitkowski set out to answer these questions, and in the process learned that two phrases stood out in the reports concerning the \ndevice. These were “vortex compression” and “separation of magnetic fields.”— Clearly they meant something, and something \nrather exotic, since the mysterious Dr. Elizabeth Adler from the University of Konigsberg had to be consulted on the arcane matter \nof “a simulation of damping of vibrations towards the centre of spherical objects.”— But the Bell, obviously, was not a sphere, nor \nwere its high-speed rotating drums “vibrating.” \n\nThe mystery deepens... \n\nAs Witkowski puts it, the Bell “possessed so many characteristic features that finding some kind of unequivocal explanation \nseemed to be attainable.”— According to him, these are: \n\n• The employment of very high voltages. \n\n• An emphasis of the phenomenon of “magnetic fields separation”. \n\n• The occurrence of “vortex compression”. \n\n• The fact that the device generated very powerful magnetic fields. \n\n• The spinning of masses / bulky elements as a means to achieve the above effects (directly or indirectly) \n\n• As a result: the generation of powerful radiation. \n\n• The continuous character of “the bell’s” operation — i.e., non-pulse \n\n• The reference about transforming mercury into gold.— \n\nThis list is interesting, especially as regards the second to last point, the hypothesized “non-pulsed” nature of the Bell’s operation. \nThis is, of all the material in Wikowski’s research, the one item that lacks any corroboration. While Witkowski is correct that this \nwas its most likely mode of operation, there is one clue that the Bell may also have been a pulsed device, and the clue comes from \nWitkowski himself: the description of its sound like a hive of bees. Such a sound is characteristic of a rapidly opening and closing \nhigh voltage direct current switch, such as the type Tesla used in his Impulse Magnifying Transmitter experiments with direct \ncurrent. The “buzz” sound is characteristic of such devices. \n\nThe last point brings up yet another oddity in the long list of oddities associated with the Bell, and that is transmutation of \nelements. It will be seen in the next chapter that there was a curious reference in the Farm Hall transcripts on two separate occasions \nto a “photochemical process” of isotope separation. I speculated that it might be some analogue or derivative to cold fusion. But here \none encounters the reference in the context of a project having little to due with “photochemistry” except in the loosest of senses. \n\nAs for the reference to transmutation, this is a partly solved problem, for there exists in the Frankfurter Zeitung und Handelsblatt, \nfor the evening edition of Friday, June 18, 1924, an article on precisely the transmutation of mercury into gold — long before the \ndiscovery of nuclear fission — by none other than Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach!— Gerlach speaks of such transmutation being \npossible through the bombardment of a target with “rays” of an unspecified nature, and then goes on to speak of the scientific \nfeasibility of alchemy! \n\nSeeking to piece all of these pieces together, Witkowski contacted Polish physicist Marek Demia_ski, a specialist in gravitational \nphysics. Outlining the Bell’s peculiar properties, Demia_ski concluded that vortex motion might be a key to generating gravitation, \nand then added that mercury would “best suit this purpose” as being “a substance of high density and simultaneously as a liquid.”— \nIndeed, if the Germans “had succeeded in aligning the axes of nuclei rotation in one direction, with the aid of a strong magnetic \nfield” then perhaps they had achieved some sort of gravitational breakthrough. — \n\nWitkowski next tackled the problem of the apparent high voltages used in the Bell. “It must have led to a discharge, and \nconsequently it must have been a question of plasma physics.” If indeed it was the case as Demia_ski suggested that the active \nsubstance in such a device be characterized by low viscosity, then gas would be of a lower viscosity than liquid, and plasma lower \nthan gas.— Plasmas created through an electric current create vortices known as plasmoids, in which “the lines of magnetic field \n\n\nforce are almost completely closed. ”— Under these conditions a plasma vortex is almost completely isolated from its surrounding \nenvironment. This in turn creates a kind of local “space time continuum” or localized space curvature. \n\nDuring the period he was formulating these observations, Witkowski visited the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion \nin Warsaw, where he was met with an incredible site, a plasma trap, having all the characteristic appearance of the Bell! \n\nThe Plasma Trap and Focus Device from the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion in Warsaw \n{From Igor Witkowski’s The Truth About the Wunderwaffe) \n\n\n\nIncredibly, the same ceramic and rubber-mat shielding was also necessitated by the device, just as they were with the Bell. \n\nCompelled by the evidence, Witkowski concluded that the Bell represented some sort of “trap for a plasma vortex.” — But the \nBell was different from the modem device Witkowski saw in one important respect. “It became evident that it was simply the \nspinning that was missing.” \n\nYes, plasma sometimes creates a kind of vortex, but this is usually a side effect. Nobody yet, nobody after the war — has built a \n“plasma focus” device chiefly for the fast spinning of heavy ions...the internal construction of every plasma is purely static. The \nconception of rotating or counterrotating cylinders remains unknown. Nobody has struck upon the idea of doing this!— \n\nThus, Witkowski was led to his final reconstruction of the Bell, and the principle of its operation and the reasons the Germans chose \nthis peculiar method of designing a “plasma focus”: \n\nI imagined a large, metal drum, in which a small amount of mercury was present. The drum would then be accelerated to a \nspeed of say tens of thousands of revolutions per minute. Under the influence of the centrifugal force the mercury, as a liquid, \nwould cover the walls of the drum creating a thin layer. After achieving the target speed a high voltage electrical discharge \nwould be created between the circumference of the drum (the mercury layer — and its axis - the core. Theoretically this would \naccelerate the ions of mercury towards the core, with a speed of many kilometers per second. But since the mercury would \nalready possess a certain torque, in due measure of approaching the core its angular velocity would increase ... thus developing \nan increase in rotational speed. In the case of the drum with mercury this would lead to an overlapping of the two speeds - \ncreated by a preservation of the torque and a result of the flow of electric current. From my approximate calculations it followed \nthat by this means it would be possible to achieve a speed of the ultimate “compressed” vortex of the order of even hundreds of \nthousands of revolutions per second.— \n\n\n\n\nAnd with these tremendous speeds of rotation with a plasma whose axes of rotation were all polarized (lined up in the same \ndirection), it followed that enormous kontrabaryc (anti-gravitational) effects might result, since the recent physics literature indicates \nprecisely such a connection between mass and rotation.— \n\nBut what of the transmutation part of it? Sensing that such vorticular structures are an inevitable template of matter itself, \nWitkowski “recalled the work of the Russian scientist Genadiy Shipov and works of the German physicist, Professor Burkhard \nHeim (working during the war at the Goettingen University). In all their works there was reference to changes being created in the \nstructure of materials by artificially generated gravitational waves.”— As will be seen subsequently, this is a signal clue that much \nmore was involved in the Bell than a mere plasma focus trap, even one incorporating the insightful concept of rotating the active \nsubstance to achieve maximum spin polarization, a concept well in keeping with Gerlach’s interests. Except for one further \nobservation, which we shall get to in a moment, further than this Witkowski does not go. \n\n\n6. A Story from the Neo-Nazi Fringe \n\n\nAmazingly, there is a story from the Neo-Nazi fringe element in North America that oddly corroborates many details of \nWitkowski’s reconstruction. The story is made the more remarkable for the fact that it appeared prior to the publication either of Nick \nCook’s Hunt for Zero Point or of the research on which its revelations on the Bell were based: Witkowski’s The Truth About the \nWunder-waffe. The story emanated from notorious “holocaust revisionist” Eric Ziindel’s Samizdat Press in Canada. The story \nallegedly came from a “Prof. Dr. Friedrich Kuhfuss, who died in Barcelona, Spain, in exile, having never been captured by the \nAllies.”— \n\nDeep among the near-primeval, dark and foreboding forests, somewhere in one of the many hilly areas of Germany, there was \na secret base simply called X. To the outside world it looked like an ancient hunting lodge, perched atop a small hill. Only two \nmeandering winding roads led up to the “Jadgschloss” as German woodsmen and small fanners of the nearby village (about 8 \nkm distant) would simply call it.... (Their) forest area had been declared a restricted area. They were told that for the duration of \nthe war the entire area was under the direct control of the S.S. All villagers were issued with special passes, with photographs; \nno outsiders were allowed to visit them and they were sworn to secrecy.... They observed... bus loads of people driving through \ntheir village, usually sombre looking men, very few women, but many of them unifonned and an exceptional number of higher \nrank officers. \n\nSince there was only one Inn in the village, The Gasthaus zum Goldenen Ochsen (The Golden Oxen) occasionally some of \nthe heavy Mercedes and Opel automobiles would stop and their occupants lunch or partake of snacks. The men behaved in a \nmost peculiar manner. They all took their briefcases with them to lunch, many of these cases being of a size larger than the \nusual German briefcase.... \n\nThere was relative quiet for a number of weeks and then one day S.S. men asked the local burgermaster to call together the \nlocal inhabitants. An officer was introduced, he announced that close to the Jagdschloss an auxiliary to a concentration camp \nwas to be set up and that the inmates were war plant workers engaged in extremely important work. Nobody was to fraternize \nwith these people and all strangers or strange happenings were to be immediately reported to the S.S. Ortskommandatur....A \nfew days later, truck after truck loaded with construction equipment of every conceivable description rolled through the \nvillage.... \n\nSoon loud and frightening blasts could be heard day in and day out, reverberating through the valleys. After a few months \nthey ceased. Then huge, slow-moving, flatbed trucks began to arrive carrying loads, covered with tarpaulins all chained to the \nplatforms and guarded by soldiers. This went on for many, many weeks. By now the whole village was rife with the most \nunbelievable rumours. \n\nOne night, the entire village was awakened and terribly frightened by sound of such high pitch and frequency that had \ncommenced only as a hardly audible humming, that it was soon realized that something very unusual was happening. They \nrushed outside and to their utter amazement and bewilderment they saw a brilliantly illuminated “thing” hovering in the air in \nthe general direction of the Jagdschloss. Then, just as violently as it had announced its arrival the sound died down, the light \nfaded and the strange “thing” settled behind the treetops, out of the sight of the relieved, yet still shaken local people....Soon \nseveral of these strange vehicles, each a little different from the other, were flying about, at first slowly but later at such fantastic \nspeeds that it was difficult to follow them with the naked eye....Sometimes, when flying so fast, they made frightful noises, big \nbangs, that reverberated around the valleys rather like heavy thunderclaps. \n\n.So, the months became years, then one day long columns of trucks clogged the roads. Since there were two roads into \n\nand out of the Jagdschloss it was difficult to know what was transpiring, but soon they knew. Less and less flying “things” \nwere seen and soon the camp was only a shadow of its former self. One day all work ceased, tremendous explosions ripped, \nonce again, through the valley, smoke rose from the area of the Jagdschloss and a few weeks later the Russians rode into town, \nunopposed, raping and looting everything in sight....Little did (the Russians) realize that in those caved-in caverns, with \nelectrical cables and wires dangling from now damp ceilings, on the debris-littered floors, in seemingly endless halls, with \nstrange bum marks on the concrete floors, walls and ceilings, had taken place one of the wonders of the world...only worthless \nbits of pieces of metal, nuts, bolts, steel rods, rubber tires, some leather and some strange-looking and feeling “slacklike,” \ngrayish substance was to be found amongst all the rubble.— \n\nThere are a number of things that would tend to indicate that this story is pure fantasy. \n\nFirst, and most importantly, the idea of SS officers openly carrying briefcases of secret research in the local Gasthaus is utter \nnonsense. For the loyalty-and-security obsessed SS such breaches would have been unthinkable; but, if committed by any member, \n\n\n\nswiftly and ruthlessly dealt with. Secondly, as Witkowski stated in a personal letter to this author, neither the more modem Schloss or \nthe mediaeval castle at Fiirstenstein were ever used as hunting lodges.— \n\nBut there are also a number of things to notice here that corroborate Witkowski’s reconstruction of the Bell in a general fashion, \nand that therefore tend to indicate that the story contains some elements of truth; indeed, it contains many elements in common with \nWitkowski’s history of the Bell project, a coincidence made more compelling for the fact that it predates Witkowski’s published \nwork, and for the fact that it comes from a source with profoundly pro-Nazi sympathies. The latter point would, in fact, tend to \nindicate that someone, somewhere, and independent of any government, knew all about the project and what it had accomplished. \n\nFirst, the story concerns a heavily forested and hilly area of Germany, which Schloss Fiirstenstein certainly qualifies for. \nSecondly, the area, and hence the project reported by the story, were under SS jurisdiction. Thirdly, there was a concentration camp \ninvolved to supply slave labor for the construction and presumably for the project.— Fourthly, the story indicates that a great amount \nof blasting occurred, which strongly suggests that a great deal of underground construction took place. As Witkowski notes, there \nare clear indications that the whole complex of Fiirstenstein was full of tunnels and galleries constructed during the war. Fifthly, very \nobviously the object reported by the village inhabitants in the story gave off strong field effects, a similarity with the Bell that is all \ntoo palpable. Sixthly, it is also clear from the story that heavy electrical cabling was involved, yet another connection with the story \nof the Bell. Seventhly, there is the report of a “slackl ik e” gray substance found among the rubble, clearly recalling the reports of \nblackish or grayish goo that resulted from the Bell’s tests on organic materials. Eighthly, the story recounts the burning and scorching \nof concrete and stone walls, tending to support the idea that whatever was involved put out strong radiation, another parallel with the \nBell as recounted by Witkowski. Finally, the story records the fact that the site was apparently quickly and thoroughly evacuated by \nthe SS, along with more blasting, an indicator, perhaps, that some of the tunnels and galleries were sealed by the SS to prevent \nwhatever that remained from falling into Russian hands. Flere again, the broad outline is consistent with the story of the Bell, with \nthe SS’ removal of the object and execution of some of the scientists and technicians involved. \n\nFlowever, one must weigh this against the unbelievable elements of the story. It is not only unlikely but entirely ludicrous that SS \nofficers involved in a top secret black project would, on their “off hours,” glibly be carrying about secret papers in their briefcases or \ntalking more or less openly about their work at the local Gasthaus. \n\n\n7. Mercury Vortex Engines...Again \n\n\nAs was mentioned previously, Witkowski does not take his analysis of the Bell any further than to imply that it was a uniquely \ndesigned plasma vortex trap that perhaps achieved extraordinary kontrabaric effects. Those effects, if one is to believe the reports of \ninhabitants of the region who spoke of “flying barrels” or even if one is to credit the story from the Neo-Nazi source above, would \nhave been so sensational that the Nazis would have given the device extreme classification. \n\nBut Witkowski is alive to the fact that the Bell might represent much more. Ending the section of his book that surveys the Bell, \nand indeed, ending his entire incredible book, Witkowski asks a question that leads him to consider an unlikely source of inspiration \nfor the whole project: \n\n(Yet) one more issue remains - how did it happen that scientists from the 1940s understood exactly where they were heading? \nThey had applied after all ideas from XXI century physics. How is it, that they were conscious of bringing about a major \nturning-point? What arguments did they lay down (before the launch of work) that caused them to win the race for funds with \nthe great and influential armaments consortiums? And they won decisively. \n\nIt seems that the whole issue is something more than just a technical problem. The unusualness of all this is summed up by \nthe fact, that descriptions of mercuric propulsion had appeared as long ago as in ancient times in alchemy and old Hindu books \n— one can easily check this. The “Samaranganasutradhara” a book at least 2,000 years old, said for example: “By means of the \npower latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside may travel a great distance in the \nsky in a most marvelous manner. \n\nWitkowski is clearly suggesting that the inspiration for the project might have come from the SS’ preoccupation with the occult, and \nfrom its investigations of the possible scientific underpinnings in various occult and esoteric treatises. \n\nWe have encountered this theme before, and, as regards the so-called “mercury vortex engines,” shall have more to say in chapter \nsix. \n\nBut here Witkowski ends his reconstruction of the Bell and his own speculations as to its operation and the actual goals the \nGermans hoped to achieve with it. In doing so, a number of significant questions remain unanswered. \n\nIt will be recalled from the foregoing presentation that Witkowski rightly understands the importance of the rotation of the \nmercury or Xerum-525 substance in the device. But, having once mentioned it, he never considers what the Germans may have been \nhoping to accomplish by counter-rotation of the same substance. In short, the kontrabaric effects of the Bell are explained by one \nrotating cylinder. So why were there two cylinders on a common axis rotating in opposite directions? Equally important: what was \ntheir configuration? Was one cylinder inside the other? Or was one cylinder on top of the other? \n\nA related question is this: beyond the possible esoteric and occult inspirations, what in the physics literature of the day might have \nformed the basis of the Lantern-Bearer Project? As we shall see, the Germans had a number of scientists other than Gerlach who \nrealized the importance of vortices for the very building blocks of matter. Once this idea is stated, one inevitably sees the implication, \nfor if vortices constitute the fundamental building blocks of matter, then they also constitute a template of action for the transmutation \nof one form of matter into another, as well as a template for a variety of other actions as well. \n\nYet another question to be at least speculatively answered is why the device was enclosed in a ceramic, bell-like shell? Was this \nchoice of material, and its shape, significant? \n\nSimilarly, the characteristic sound the Bell made while in operation was like a beehive. This sound could be indicative of a rapidly \nopening and closing switch to pulse the device with high voltage (most likely, direct) current. \n\nFinally, the Bell’s effects on living organisms — whatever its extraordinary kontrabaric and “temporal dilation” effects might have \nbeen — surely could not have been lost on the Germans either. Clearly they were in the presence of a phenomenon that could be \napplied in a variety of ways, as a means perhaps of propulsion, perhaps even of communication, and perhaps also as a weapon. \n\nThe phenomenon the Nazis had accessed via the Bell was a unified phenomenon and pointed to an underlying unified physics. \nThe question is, what is that phenomenon? What were the Nazis after? Did they know what they had accessed? \n\nWhy does the figure of Gerlach keep popping up? Why, for example, is an expert in spin polarization, gravitation, transmutation \nof elements, and mercury plasma, placed in charge of Nazi Germany’s public atom bomb project? Why are his diaries still classified? \nWhy would an anti-gravity device suddenly become a Wunderwaffe? What possible type of physics could underlie all these things? \n\nWitkowski himself points the way to the theme that will guide us in the next few chapters: vortices. \n\n\n5 . \n\n\n„Working in Fields of Physics that were Monstrous on a Daily Basis“ \n\n\n“(Scalar) weapons are the most powerful and flexible weapons on earth. Nothing else can stand against them. Any nation not \npossessing (scalar) weapons is already a second-rate power, regardless of how many nuclear missiles, bombers, and \nsubmarines it possesses, or how many high-energy lasers and high power microwave weapons it possesses” \n\nTom Bearden, Fer De Lance: Briefing on Soviet Scalar Electromagnetic Weapons \n\n\nA. Strange Claims and Quotations: Indicators of Wartime German Research in “Scalar” Weapons \n\n\nWhen approaching the more extreme claims advanced in some exotic literature for Nazi secret weapons developments, one has \nthe impression of some dark mediaeval alchemists’ laboratory, with the alchemists dressed in the black uniforms of the SS, cracking \nwhips on the backs of emaciated concentration camp slaves to perfect their dreadful machines of power and annihilation. It has all \nthe elements — were the scope of human suffering involved not so real and so enormous — of a bad Hollywood “B” movie, with a \ngaunt Boris Karloff orchestrating an oddball cast that includes Bela Lugosi, Peter Lorre, Vincent Price and Sydney Greenstreet, all \nplaying larger-than-life villains conspiring to conquer the world. \n\nBut the situation is not helped by the strange quotations from reliable sources which, if one really pays attention to them, should \ngive one pause. Consider two examples from the Farm Hall Transcripts, the transcripts of the conversations of the German atom- \nbomb scientists interred at Farm Hall, secretly recorded by the British and declassified by them only in 1992. The two examples, \nwhich I cited without extensive commentary in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, concern artificial \nrubies, and an unknown “photochemical process” of isotope enrichment. I will cite both sets of quotations and my remarks \nconcerning them from that book directly. \n\n\n\n1. The Artificial Rubies ” Passage from The Farm Hall Transcipts (Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 142-132) \n\n\nOn pages 142 and 143 of Reich of the Black Sun I observed that one of the interred Farm Hall scientists made a rather astonishing \nstatement, a statement made astonishing not only for its “matter-of-fact” passing nature and brevity, but also because it called forth \nalmost no comment from the editor of the transcripts: \n\nThen, on July 21, 1945, the handsome and cynical Horst Korsching, discussing the prospects for making a living with Diebner \nand Bagge, offers a curious observation: \n\n“BAGGE: For the sake of the money, I should like to work on the uranium engine; on the other hand, I should like to \nwork on cosmic rays. I feel like Diebner about this. \n\n“KORSCHING: Would you both like to construct an uranium engine? \n\n\n“DIEBNER: This is the chance to earn a living. \n\n“KORSCHING: Every layman can see that these ideas are exceedingly important. Hence there won’t be any money in it. You \nonly make money on ideas which have escaped the general public. If you invent something like artificial rubies for the watch \nmaking industry, you will make more money than with the uranium engine.”— \n\nI then commented as follows: \n\nArtificial rubies? Of course, such things were used in watchmaking before the invention of quartz movement. But in 1945, the \nidea was fantastic. Of course, by the time of the declassification of these transcripts, the world’s first laser, which did in fact use \nan artificial ruby as the main component of the lasing optical cavity, was history, having been invented in 1961. But in July \n1945 the idea was more than a little ahead of its time. Is this another possible, though slight, indication that something else was \ngoing on inside Nazi Germany? Later in the conversation, Korsching expresses his desire to return Hechingen to collect his \ntelescope, lenses and prisms, an indication that he was perhaps involved in optical as well as nuclear research. — \n\nThe mention there of the connection between lasers and artificial rubies was not accidental, for on page 104 of Reich of the Black \nSun, I cited the following quotation from former British intelligence officer-cum-joumalist Tom Agoston, who first broke the story of \nthe Kammlerstab, the SS’s secret weapons think tank, to the West in the 1980s: \n\nIts purpose was to pave the way for building nuclear-powered aircraft, working on the application of nuclear energy for \npropelling missiles and aircraft; laser beams, then still referred to as “death rays”: a variety of homing rockets, and to seek other \npotential areas for high-technology breakthrough. In modem high-tech jargon, the operation would probably be referred to as \nan “SS research think tank.” Some work on second-generation secret weapons, including the application of nuclear propulsion \nfor aircraft and missiles, was already well advanced.— \n\nWhat is interesting is the juxtaposition of these two quotations, for while Agoston offers no evidence for his assertion that the SS was \nworking on the development of lasers during the war, he nonetheless clearly states that this was an avenue of research being \npursued. \n\nThus, the subsequent appearance of the Farm Hall Transcripts in the early 1990s oddly corroborates Agoston’s assertions with \nKorsching’s very curious reference to artificial rubies, a then costly and time-consuming process that surely would have merited \nmore than merely making rubies for watches. Since the transcripts had not yet been declassified by the British government when \nAgoston wrote his book, we can only assume that Agoston did not know the contents of the still secret Transcripts and was basing \nhis assertions on his confidential talks with Dr. Wilhelm Voss, who first disclosed the story of Kammler’s black projects secret \nweapons think tank. \n\nThis juxtaposition argues very strongly, though only circumstantially, that the SS was indeed involved in researching lasers. \nWhile we do not yet know how far they pressed this research, nor to what degree of success, it is in any case not of immediate \nconcern, since the theoretical possibility of lasers already existed within quantum mechanics at that time. \n\nBut what is of real interest is the type of physics that Agoston’s and Korsching’s remarks - made decades apart and independently \nof each other — indicate about the nature of the physics concepts the Germans were investigating, in this case, aspects of quantum \n\n\nmechanics and coherence. As was seen in Reich of the Black Sun, Nazi ideology itself, with its rejection of “Jewish” relativistic \nphysics, would have naturally turned to the home-grown, “purely Aryan” and equally successful, quantum mechanical theory as a \nconceptual basis from which to pursue its advanced projects. We shall return to this all-important though brief clue, coherence , in a \nmoment. For now, let us turn our attention to a second odd quotation, another weird glimpse into the possible areas of physics the SS \nwas investigating. \n\n\n\n2. The Farm Hall Transcript’s Indications of a German Photochemical Process of Isotope Separation and Enrichment \n\n\nAs recounted in Reich of the Black Sun, once the interred German scientists had learned of the Allied a-bombing of Hiroshima, \nthey then begin to debate how the Allies could have “done it so soon,” a discussion that naturally quickly turns to the question of \nseparating and enriching enough uranium 235 isotope. In one short exchange between Karl Wirtz and Otto Hahn, the discoverer of \nnuclear fission, the deduction is quickly made by Hahn that the Allies could only have achieved the production of a uranium a-bomb \nwith such processes, a sentiment quickly echoed by Wirtz with his comment “They have it too, ”— a short admission pregnant with \nimplications that methods of isotope separation were clearly known and available to the Germans during the war. \n\nBut as I noted in Reich of the Black Sun, “a short, but astonishing, exchange between Hahn, Weizsacker, Harteck, Wirtz, and \nDiebner” then follows: \n\nHAHN: I think it’s absolutely impossible to produce one ton of uranium 235 by separating isotopes. \n\n\nWEIZSACKER: What do you do with these centrifuges? \n\nHARTECK: You can never get pure “235” with the centrifuge. But I don’t believe that it can be done with the centrifuge. \nWIRTZ: No certainly not. \n\nHAHN: Yes, but they could do it with mass spectrographs. Ewald has some patent. \n\nDIEBNER: There is also a photochemical process.— \n\nAs Reich of the Black Sun goes on to indicate, this little exchange is a sign that perhaps the scientists are playing out a farce on their \nBritish captors, and that the farce may even be continuing by the British themselves in their declassification of the transcripts. \n\nWhat do I mean by this? What I mean is that the British declassification is significant for when it occurs, and I only explored a few \nof the possible reasons in the previous book: \n\nNote that the transcripts are declassified by the British after the German reunification in 1989, an oblique admission, perhaps, \nthat there was no more purpose in maintaining whatever secrets they still held, since there would now be other sources available \nto tell the story that had been long suppressed: that the Nazis had been either perilously close to, or had actually acquired the \natom bomb before the Allies.— \n\nTo see what the “farce” being played out by the interred German scientists and the British government’s declassification may be, one \nneeds to examine a significant question that I only hinted at in various places in Reich of the Black Sum. What is this “photochemical \nprocess”? \n\nA second reference to this mysterious unknown photochemical process occurs a little later in the Transcripts, during a brief but \nvery suggestive interchange between Hartek and Wirtz: \n\nHARTEK: They have managed it with mass spectrographs on a large scale or else they have been successful with a \nphotochemical process. \n\n\nWIRTZ: Well I would say photochemistry or diffusion, ordinary diffusion. They irradiate it with a particular wavelength (all \ntalking together). — \n\nI then commented as follows: \n\nAt this juncture, Bernstein— again observes that “it is not clear” what this photochemical process is.“— In any case, whatever \nthe process was, Wirtz’s mention of it and of irradiation with a particular “wavelength” appears to have provoked a burst of \nconversation from the other scientists. Were they intentionally trying to drown him out and mask his statements so as not to be \nrecorded? We will never know.— \n\nBut perhaps we really do know what this mysterious though unknown photochemical process of isotope enrichment is. \n\n\nA clue is again afforded by the timing of the declassification of the Farm Hall Transcripts: after German reunification. But their \ndeclassification also occurs after another significant event, the discovery and publication of the first cold fusion experiments by Pons \nand Fleischmann. Most do not associate cold fusion with isotope separation and enrichment, but the fact of the matter is, by very \neasily engineered processes that might best be called precisely “electrolytic” or “photochemical” , nuclear transmutation of elements \nhas been observed in laboratories all over the world since then, and using materials relatively easily obtained, and able to be \nengineered in any competent high school or in a garage laboratory bench. The literature covering these cold fusion transmutations is \neasily available on any internet search.— \n\nIf this or something similar is indeed what the Germans meant by a “photochemical process,” then the contents of the Farm Hall \nTranscripts are nothing less than revolutionary, for it means that we have a second indicator, in a very different way, that the \nGermans were researching the phenomenon of quantum coherence of the medium in a variety of systematically pursued ways.— On \nthis view the timing of the release of the transcripts is significant in a dual way, as occurring (1) after German reunification and (2) \nafter the first public release of cold fusion experimental data. \n\nThe implications of the transcripts’ two allusions to such a photochemical process by interred German scientists in 1945 is \nstaggering, for if they had actually discovered and conducted such experiments — and there was certainly ideological impetus from \nthe Nazi government in its pursuit of “energy independence” to do so - and if they had advanced from an initial “Pons and \nFleischman” apparatus to a more sophisticated version that accomplished the transmutation of elements at room temperature, as in the \nrecent Japanese experiments, then we have a second, though still tenuous, indicator that the SS was pursuing some very \nextraordinarily advanced physics conceptions indeed. And there would have been little if anything required in such experiments that \ndid not exist in some form available to the Germans during the war. \n\nSmall wonder then, that when Wirtz begins to talk of irradiation at particular wavelengths that the other scientists appear to begin \ntalking all at once, as if to drown out his comments from the British recorders, an effort that, if one takes Bernstein’s editorial \nmystification as any indicator, was entirely successful.— \n\nWhat do we have, then, at this juncture? \n\nFirst, we have allusions, from the same source, to two different phenomena — lasers and a “photochemical process” of nuclear \ntransmutation - involving quantum coherence at some level. Second, in the case of the reference to artificial rubies and their implied \nuse in lasers, we have further corroboration from an independent source of research, Agoston, whose corroboration of the “laser” \nside of the story comes prior to the release of the Transcripts themselves and Korsching’s passing remark about artificial rubies. \nFinally, the declassification and release of the Farm Hall Transcripts themselves may be significant with respect to timing in a dual \nsense, as occurring after German reunification, and after the first public release of cold fusion laboratory data by Pons and \nFleischmann. \n\n\n3. Back to Roswell and the Majestic 12 Documents: Another Odd Corroboration of Possible Nazi Knowledge of Cold Fusion \n\n\nThis last point, and the reference to cold fusion, is highly significant for yet another reason. In Reich of the Black Sun I also \nattempted to subject some of the Cooper-Cantwheel Majestic-12 documents to an analysis of their technical descriptions of the \ncrashed and allegedly “extraterrestrial” vehicle(s), with a view to determine if the technical data warranted a conclusion that the \ncrashed and recovered vehicle(s) was necessary piloted by “ET” and if the technical data as summarized in the documents \nconclusively demonstrated a non-terrestrial origin for the crafty— The conclusion that I reached was, that while exotic, the described \ntechnologies were not exotic enough to warrant such a conclusion. \n\nOne of the objects recovered and described in those documents was a circular plastic tube, about one inch in diameter, through the \ncenter of which ran a copper tube. A liquid solution appeared to exist inside the tube, which the document implies is “water.” At this \njuncture, as I noted in Reich of the Black Sun, the Nazi “Project Paperclip” rocket scientists were brought in to examine the craft and \nmake a pronouncement. Two of the scientists who allegedly examined the craft were Von Braun and Von Karman, “who were \nunable to identify” the craft as a Nazi V-Weapon. However, they were able to hypothesize that its propulsion was via “a very radical \nform of propulsion via a charge differential, a fact that suggests that while they may not have been able to identify it, they at least \nmay have had their strong suspicions.”— \n\nAdditionally, the almost \n\nSingle-mindedly “terrestrial” nature of the technology described should be clearly obvious: a simple plastic tube, approximately \nan inch in diameter, filled with a substance that is apparently water, in the center of which is a rod wrapped with a coil of “what \nappears to be...copper material.” Moreover, apparently enough examination or analysis and speculation had been done for the \ninvestigators to conclude that the doughnut reactor was somehow a “heavy water” reactor, and that the German scientists are \nalready thinking in terms of a fusion rather than a fission reactor. This is perhaps significant, for the equipment described, in the \ncontext of fusion, suggests the same apparatus set up, in some respects, as the process later known as cold fusion.— \n\nWhy would the scientists Von Braun and Von Karman have even been thinking in such terms in 1947? Clearly, one reason is that if \nthe Majestic-12 documents are indeed genuine, and therefore describing real events, then any hot fusion reaction would simply have \ndisintegrated any such “plastic doughnut” in a matter of nanoseconds. Consequently, this means that the Nazi rocket scientists are \nthinking in such unconventional terms that it compels the possibility that they might have seen or heard of such technology before. \nThis is another indicator, from yet a totally different quarter that a very different habit of “physics thinking and conceptualization” \nmay have been very common currency within the bowels of the Third Reich’s secret weapons projects. It may further indicate yet \nagain that much more was being done at Peenemiinde during the war than research into mere rockets. \n\nWe now have an extremely odd assortment of statements indeed. One group of German scientists are talking about \n“photochemical processes” of isotope separation and enrichment, which sounds an awful lot like cold fusion, while yet another \ngroup of German scientists from a wholly different weapons project is talking about more or less the same thing, and yet a third \nscientist from the first group is found making one short but highly provocative statement about artificial rubies. \n\nTaken together these are strong indicators that within the “reach” of SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler’s black projects \nempire the idea of quantum coherence was apparently a central research preoccupation, and that a variety of avenues were being \npursued to make the “coherence” of the zero point energy — and weapons based upon it - a practical possibility. \n\nBut there is yet a final quotation that we must examine with regard to whatever exotic and unifying conceptual foundations the \nNazi physicists and engineers may have been seeking. \n\n\n4. A British Intelligence Agent’s Statement on the Monstrous Areas of Physics being Developed by the Kammlerstab \n\n\nAs recounted in Reich of the Black Sun, a statement was made to German atom bomb project researchers Edgar Meyer and \nThomas Mehner by an anonymous British intelligence source, an individual who had been a part of the British and American \nintelligence teams sent in to vacuum Kammler’s Black Reich-within-the-Reich of every patent and secret weapons project they could \nfind. The man referred to a “fourth team” within SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler’s secret weapons “think tank,” The fact that \nhe chose to remain anonymous speaks for itself; clearly, there is something extraordinary and much more dangerous than nuclear or \nthermonuclear weapons in the SS’ bag of “alchemical physics:” \n\nYes, and then there was also the fourth team, about which we heard rumors during the last phase of the war. This was certainly \nso shadowy and fantastic, that one could only construe it as a ploy. But after the war it became evident that the world had \navoided a colossal catastrophe by a hair’s breath.... This fourth team worked in afield that was monstrous on a daily basis. And \nwhen I say this, I meant thereby that they experimented with things that a well-informed public would to this very day think \nthem to be unthinkable and unbelievable, and thus imaginary. I mean to imply that these specialists worked in conceptions that \ntotally abandoned conventional physical laws.— \n\nWhile this quotation clearly pointed in the direction of some of the more exotic weapons projects that were subsequently outlined in \nReich of the Black Sun, the fundamental question it poses nonetheless remains: just exactly what type of strange physics were the \nGermans actually up to with their “implosion engines”, “bladeless turbines,” radar absorbent materials research, and even the Bell \nitself? \n\nWere all these projects merely indicative of some mad, insane hodge-podge of a desperate Reich trying to save an increasingly \ndisastrous military situation by snatching at any means to achieve it whatsoever? Clearly such an explanation would explain much of \nthe case, but not everything, and particularly not the quotations being examined in more detail here. So is there an underlying \nconceptual foundation for all these things, a conceptual foundation that would call forth such a sobering evaluation from a British \nintelligence agent implying monstrous areas of physics and the destruction of the world in a context that clearly implies he is not \nreferring to mere atom or hydrogen bombs? \n\nTo answer this important question, one must examine the statements of Lt. Col. Tom Bearden (US Army, Ret.)^ and his claims \nof what exactly constitutes “scalar” physics, and his account of its history. In doing so, we shall discover some significant indicators \nthat he has missed, or perhaps that he has intentionally left unstated, indicators that imply that the story of weaponized scalar physics \nbegins earlier than post-war Soviet Russia. \n\n\nB. Bearden’s Reconstruction of the History of Scalar Physics \n\n\nLt. Col. Tom Bearden has been a consistent proponent of the possibility of accessing the so-called “Zero Point Energy” or ZPE \nby means of what he calls “scalar physics” for almost two decades.— More importantly, one consistent aim of his works has been to \npoint out the extreme power and danger of such physics when it is weaponized. Indeed, much of his writing was initiated by the \nconcern to alert the West and America to the dangers of an on-going Soviet quest to perfect scalar weapons. I recounted much of the \nhistory of the Soviet development of such weapons in my book on the Weapon Hypothesis of the Great Pyramid, The Giza Death \nStar Deployed.— That history is reprised, and expanded, here. \n\nTo understand why the Soviet Union would have developed such awesome weaponry — and their potential power will be \ndiscussed below — one must go back to the end of World War Two, the beginning of the nuclear age, and the Cold War. One must \ncomprehend the geopolitical and military situation of that time not only from the Russian point of view but from Stalin’s point of \nview. Fully one half of the fifty million military and civilian casualties of World War Two were suffered by the Russians.— \n\nWorld War Two would not have been won, and most certainly have been lost, without them. For the German Wehrmacht, the sheer \nscale of operations on the Russian front dwarfed all others; all other fronts, the Italian and French theaters, were for the Nazi military \ncolossus a mere sideshow. The barbarity of that campaign and the enormous loss of life it caused were the result, not of a conflict \nbetween good and evil, but of two barbarous, genocidal and paranoid regimes intent on their own survival and the utter annihilation \nof the other. After a three-month campaign in 1941, the Wehrmacht came within a hair’s breath of doing just that, and the Red \nArmy, after clawing its way back with rivers of its own blood, over the next three and a half years, finally succeeded. \n\nConsequently, by the end of the war, Soviet Russia was in tatters. Not only had she lost approximately sixteen percent of her pre¬ \nwar population, but the cities of European Russia were piles of rubble; her workforce, industry, and infrastructure were severely \ndislocated and strained. Her manpower reserves were exhausted, her economy was a shambles, and her people understandably war \nweary. To make this dismal military picture even more bleak, America had successfully developed the atomic bomb and deployed it \nin war. \n\nTo the Western Allies, therefore, the picture looked as if the Red Army — superbly equipped and competently led — was poised \nto roll over Western Europe. But to Stalin and his marshals the situation was bleak. He needed to demobilize, but in effect, could not, \nsince the Red Army was his one credible bargaining chip. Only its sheer size, its quality of arms and its leadership, offset the \nAmerican atomic monopoly. Therefore, much to the chagrin of Soviet economic planners, they had to do the impossible. They had \nto maintain their devastated economy on a war footing, while simultaneously rebuilding the infrastructure of European Russia, and \nthey had to acquire and deploy atomic bombs in sufficient numbers to be a credible power vis-a-vis the United States and its allies. \n\nBy 1949 Russian spies and scientists had indeed achieved the impossible. They had delivered the a-bomb into Stalin’s hands. And \na few months after the first American H-bomb, the Soviet Union would acquire its own thermonuclear capability. There was just one \nproblem. The Soviet Union could never hope to out produce America in thermonuclear weapons. \n\nIt is in this total context that Bearden’s reconstruction of the Soviet secret project to acquire scalar weapons should be seen. As he \nputs it: \n\nAs one aftermath of the U.S. development and use of the atomic bomb, Stalin — ever the total dictator - lashed his Soviet \nAcademy of Sciences furiously. Undoubtedly he pointed out that the destiny of communism had been frustrated by this great \ntechnical breakthrough made by the Americans (with help from the British and from political European refugees). \n\nIndeed, as Reich of the Black Sun argued, it is extremely doubtful that the American Manhattan Project would have been successful \nduring the course of the war at all if it were not for the surrender of enriched uranium 235 for its uranium bomb, and infrared bomb \nfuses for its plutonium bomb, by Nazi Germany. Stalin at this point “informed his scientists in no uncertain terms that the next such \nbreakthrough had better be Soviet.”— Indeed, Stalin’s exact words could have left no doubt: “The destiny of communism has been \nfrustrated by the U.S. development of the atomic bomb. That is not the last great technical breakthrough. The next one will be \nSoviet! You will provide me with that great new technical breakthrough at all speed, or I will have your heads. Do I make myself \nclear, comrades?”— Stalin thus \n\nplanned to do exactly what the U.S. had done: Find a new area for a great technical breakthrough and superweapon, put the \nentire resources of the nation behind it, develop it in great secrecy, and thrust it upon the U.S. and its allies at the eleventh \nhour....— \n\nAs a result of Stalin’s threats, “the entire Soviet scientific community was galvanized into a most intensive review of all physics.”— \n\n\nThis was the most massive scientific scavenger hunt in history, a Manhattan Project-sized effort, all designed simply to scour through \nwestern scientific journals for a clue that might suggest an area for such a technical breakthrough for a superweapon. \n\nLarge review institutions were quickly set up, staffed with the best Soviet scientists and support translators and teams. One such \nsearch institute involved some 2,000 PhDs along with their support staffs. Soviet ships brought in shiploads of copies of all the \nscientific journals of the West - from the beginning -, and they were reviewed paper-by-paper, page-by-page. Anything novel \nand implying new scientific possibilities, or anything that had not been adequately followed up, was laid aside in a ‘select’ pile \nfor further review and decision by the best Soviet theoreticians available. \n\nSoviet science was scouring the forgotten or discarded and in some cases even the exotic and esoteric avenues of Western science. \nSoviet physics in particular was, due to Russia’s isolation and communist ideology, in almost the same situation as physics had been \nin the Nazi Reich. \n\nBearden’s argument now takes a decidedly speculative turn, but one that is very convincing. Arguing that the Soviet have scalar \nweapons because certain events and physical anomalies in postwar history bear the clear signature of scalar physics, he then poses \nthe question of how and why the Soviets were led to develop such weapons. The answer is the scenario already outlined. Bearden \nthen inquires what specifically they might have found as the “scientific scavenger teams” sifted through scientific journals. Was there \nanything in the scientific, peer-reviewed literature that would serve as the theoretical foundations for the development of a \n“superweapon” more powerful than Russia’s or America’s own hydrogen bombs? \n\nHis answer is astonishing. The Russian physicists discovered not only a basis for the unification of physical fields that was pre- \nrelativistic, but they found one that could be reconciled with quantum mechanics that would allow them to tap into, or “cohere,” the \nlimitless “Zero Point Energy” or “quantum potential.”— It was thus practical and weaponizable. Moreover, as will be seen below, it \nwas a very flexible weapons platform, capable of a variety of uses and effects, and capable of use in varying degrees of destructive \npower, up to and including gigantic regional devastation and, as we shall see, even capable of planet-busting potential. \n\nBut what exactly is scalar, or “quantum potential”, physics? To answer that question, one must look at Bearden’s examination of \nclassical electromagnetic theory and the implicit assumptions that have been the basis of “public consumption” physics since \nMaxwell in the nineteenth century. His examination is another component of the history of scalar physics. \n\n\n1. Bearden on the State of Electromagnetic, or Electrodynamic, Theory, and the Elements of Scalar, or Quantum Potential, \n\nPhysics \n\n\na. Classical Electromagnetic Theory as a Perpetual Motion Machine \n\n\nAccording to Bearden, contemporary theoretical and experimental physics has been on the wrong track since at least the \nnineteenth century since Heaviside editted the brilliant work of James Clerk Maxwell in unifying the magnetic and electric fields. In \nfact, physics has been so wrong that electromagnetic theory itself is the single best example of a fundamental violation of one of the \nfoundational laws of physics: the conservation of energy. This is because, unbelievably, standard electromagnetic theory, as it is \ntaught to this day in universities in the West, has no solid explanation for the origin of electric charge in two of the most fundamental \nparticles in nuclear physics and quantum mechanics: the proton, and the electron: \n\nLet us put it bluntly: Every charge in the universe already freely and continuously pours out (electromagnetic) energy in (three \ndimensional space) in all directions, without any observable energy input. That is the well-concealed source charge problem, \nknown but ignored by the leaders of the scientific community for a century. All (electromagnetic) fields and potentials and their \nenergy come from those source charges, according to electrodynamics itself. Either we must give up the conservation of energy \nlaw entirely, or else we must accept the fact that unobservable virtual (electromagnetic) mass and energy are continuously \nabsorbed from the vacuum by the source charge, transduced into real observable (electromagnetic) energy, and then re-radiated \nin (three dimensional space) in all directions as observable (electromagnetic) energy, creating the associated fields and potentials \nreaching out across the universe.— \n\nThe result of this absurd situation is that the engineering models and devices based on this standard electrodynamics continue to \nassume “that the charge freely creates real (electromagnetic) energy out of nothing at all, in total violation of the conservation of \nenergy law.” Thus, physics faculties, government grant and funding agencies, and corporate research laboratories “unwittingly \nadvocate perpetual motion machines on a scale unparalleled in history. They continue to support an electrical engineering model and \na classical electrodynamics model which do not even model the active vacuum and its exchange with every charge, much less a \nbroken symmetry in that exchange.”— \n\nIn case this is not clear enough, Bearden, who has a bachelor of science degree in mathematics, a master of science degree in \nengineering, and a PhD in science, puts the miserable state of “public consumption physics” and its electrodynamics in no uncertain \nterms: \n\nThere is not now, and there never has been, a single electrical engineering department, electrical engineering professor, or \nelectrical engineering textbook that teaches what powers an electrical circuit. Yet the basis for it has clearly been in particle \nphysics since 1957, as certified by the award of the Nobel Prize to Lee and Yang. What powers every electrical circuit and \nsystem is the broken symmetry of the primary power system’s source charges and source dipole (i.e., the broken symmetry of \nthe opposite charges on the ends of the dipole) in its fierce energy exchange with the seething vacuum, once that dipole has \nbeen made.... Further, any dipole will freely extract (electromagnetic) energy from the vacuum, convert it into real, usable, \nobservable (electromagnetic) energy, and pour out real, usable (electromagnetic) energy continuously and indefinitely, so long \nas the dipole remains intact.— \n\nOr to put it more simply, all electromagnetic devices and circuits “are already powered — though in an inappropriate fashion — by \n(electromagnetic) energy freely extracted from the vacuum. ”— All electrical circuits, in other words, are already “zero point \nenergy” or “quantum potential” devices.— They are just massively inefficient ones for reasons that will be seen shortly. \n\nSince classical electrodynamics viewed charge in a most unscientific manner as a “perpetual motion machine” getting energy from \nliterally nowhere, the next error inevitably followed: electrical circuits and electromagnetic systems were closed systems. \n\nBut how, then, would classical electrodynamics explain the Coler coil, the curious circuit reproduced in Reich of the Black \nSun ?— \n\n\nThe Coler Coil \n\n\n\nAs mentioned there, this odd hexagonal arrangement of coils and magnets had absolutely no source of power and yet it managed to \nproduce power. \n\nClearly, this circuit, understood in the wider context of the other issues examined in this chapter, would have spurred the German \nscientists to seek an explanation within the context of the ideologically approved physics of the Nazi regime, i.e., in quantum \nmechanics and its prediction of a vacuum flux, or “zero point energy.” In understanding such a circuit, in understanding any circuit, \none will thus find it necessary — if one is to avoid the “perpetual motion machine” of standard electrodynamics — “to think in terms \nof the supersystem, defined as having three components, which are (i) the physical power system itself, (ii) the active local vacuum, \nand (iii) the active local curvatures of spacetime.”— Any electrical circuit is thus not a closed system but an open systems. — \n\nWe now have the first three fundamental components of scalar physics and technologies: \n\n1. the medium, aether substrate, or “active local vacuum”, \n\n2. the local curved dynamic of space,— and \n\n3. an understanding of circuits as open systems, rather than closed perpetual motion machines. \n\nMoreover, as the Coler Coil seems to imply, some circuits are more efficient at transducing this “active vacuum” energy than others, \nand one may reasonably assume, therefore, that this efficiency is a function of its circuit parameters, i.e., of its geometry and \n“electrical topology, ” of its shape. \n\n\nb. What the Soviets (and Nazis) Found in their Scavenger Hunt: E. T. Whittaker’s Decomposition of Scalar \nPotentials into Bi-Directional Longitudinal Waves \n\n\nSo, with these observations in mind, it is time to ask the important question: What exactly did the Soviets find during their \nscavenger hunt? And more to the point, what might the Germans have concluded and carefully classified from their examination of \nthe Coler Coil? To answer this, it is necessary to take up Bearden’s reconstruction of the history of scalar weapons where we left it \noff. \n\nBearden maintains that in scouring the West’s scientific journals the Soviets would have come across three relatively obscure, \nhighly mathematical, entirely pre-relativistic, and immensely unusual papers. Two of them were by the well-known mathematician \nand theoretical physicist E.T. Whittaker, and one was by a physicist named Barus. Of the three, the Whittaker papers are \nbreathtaking in their implications, not the least of which because they can be made to work within the context of the later-developed \nquantum theory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first paper, a lengthy and highly mathematical tome, is a masterpiece whose full implications — in spite of its benign and \nsomewhat intimidating title “On the partial differential equations of mathematical physics” — are spelled out by Whittaker in the \nconclusion of the paper(I have italicized the significant portions that bear directly on Bearden’s analysis which follows): \n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the field of force due to a gravitating body can be analyzed, by a “spectrum analysis ” as it \nwere, into an infinite number of constituent fields; and although the whole field of force does not vary with time, yet each of the \nconstituent fields is of an undulatory character, consisting of a simple wave-disturbance propagated with uniform velocity.... \nIn each of these constituent fields the potential will be constant along each wave-front, and consequently the gravitational force \nin each constituent field will be perpendicular to the wave-front, i.e., the waves will be longitudinal.— \n\nThe significance of this short paragraph may be missed unless one remembers that E.T. Whittaker was also a physicist who believed \nardently in the aether, i.e., in a medium or mechanism of electromagnetic energy propagation. Indeed, he is the same Whittaker who \nwrote a classic history of the concept of the aether. Note also that this paper was originally published in Germany, and therefore, the \nGermans could hardly have been unaware of its existence or of its importance as a non-relativistic physics as they sought to explain \nthe curious anomalies of the Coler Coil or their late war radar experiments. Indeed, their experiments with radar, and even the Bell \nitself, are evidence that they were pursuing this “scalar physics” with a vengeance. \n\nTo understand what Bearden means by “scalar” waves in the medium or vacuum, we must now go further into the history of \nwhere public consumption physics went wrong. According to Bearden, it began to make its first massive wrong turn after Maxwell. \nMaxwell first formulated his equations in a mathematical language all but extinct today, a mathematical language called quaternion \ngeometry. This mathematical language differs significantly from the standard “linear algebra,” “tensor calculus” and “vector \nanalysis” in which the standard electromagnetic theory is usually couched in textbooks and physics lectures. In short, the equations \none leams in physics textbooks and physics courses today as Maxwell’s equations are not Maxwell’s original equations! They are \nedited equations. But to understand what effect this simple change of mathematical language — from quaternions to vector analysis \n— had on physics, we need to understand a few simple concepts. \n\nFirst, there are two type of effects that electromagnetic fields can have on charged particles: (1) translation, and (2) stress. There \nare two types of translation, or movement. The first type is simple translation in a straight line, producing the electrical, or “E” field \nitself. The second type of movement is that of a spiral, mathematically symbolized as the “B” field. We will not be dealing with the \n“B” field immediately. \n\nNow let us assume there are two vectors, E t and E 2 , acting upon a particle as shown: \n\n\n\nThe result is a translation in the direction of vector E 3 as the two vectors are added together to get a result, which is called aptly \nenough, a “resultant” vector. Thus, in systems where a large number of translation vectors are involved, “the entire system can be \nreplaced by a single vector,” the resultant, which describes the actual translation that results from the original vectors.— \n\nNow observe that if no translation occurs, the resultant is a “zero vector.” However, one must always recall that one is dealing \nwith geometry and not simply mathematics or numbers. One can therefore envision a multitude of multi-vector systems resulting in a \nzero translation vector, and yet which have profoundly different internal stresses and geometries: \n\n\n\n\nIf one were trained to think only in terms of the conventions of linear algebra to replace multi-vector systems with a resultant vector, \nthen in each of the three cases or systems above, one will replace the entire system with a zero resultant vector. This means that the \ninternal stresses of the systems and their rotational characteristics — each obviously quite different — are all replaced by a zero \nvector, and thus the three systems are erroneously reduced to physical equivalence by a mathematical convention!. \n\nNow we are in a position to see what a scalar is, and why Maxwell deliberately chose quaternion geometry to write his equations, \nfor he had in mind when he did so precisely the types of physical stress situations that are simply represented by the vortices in the \nabove diagram. \n\nIn standard linear algebra, each of the arrows in the above system would be mathematically represented like this: \nv(vector) = ai + bj + ck. \n\nThus, if the total sum of all such vectors is no translation, then one will replace all such mathematical expressions with a zero vector. \nBut as we have seen, each of these systems contains an internal rotation or stress, so something remains. The question is, how to \nrepresent it mathematically? \n\nIn quaternion geometry, a quaternion is simply a “scalar” plus a “vector,” and a “scalar” is simply a pure magnitude, a “number” \nthat has no direction. It simply “is.” Thus, a quaternion (q) is a scalar(s) plus a vector (v): \n\nq = s + v \n\nSubstituting our previous expression of a vector into this, we get \nq = s + ai + bj + ck. \n\nThus, for the hexagonally shaped system above, one would have six different expressions resembling q = s + ai + bj + ck. Now \nimagine we multiply each of these vectors. According to the special rules in linear algebra for multiplying such things, we know that \nzero times zero is zero. So in linear algebra one would end up with nothing once again, a zero vector, since no translation has \noccurred. But in quaternion geometry the scalars, which are not zero, ail multiply, and give — according to the rules of quaternion \nmultiplication — the following result: \n\nq x q= s 2 + t 2 + u 2 + w 2 + x 2 + y 2 + 0 V , \n\nwhere 0 V is the zero vector and the squared quantities are the multiplied scalars. Thus, in quaternion geometry the internal stress is \npreserved even though there is zero translation occurring. The scalars thus represent pure magnitudes of force “locked within ” a \nstructure possessing no “direction ” or ’’translation. ” \n\nNow we are in a position to understand what scalar physics is: it is not standard vector or “linear” physics in any sense, but is the \nnon-linear physics of internal stresses in the local medium. \n\nWe are likewise now in a position to understand the enormous implications of the end of Whittaker’s paper quoted above, \nimplications that Bearden’s analysis makes quite clear: \n\n(The) interference of scalar potentials - each of which is actually a set of longitudinal (electromagnetic) waves, and not a scalar \nentity at all, but a multivectorial entity — produces (electromagnetic) fields and waves and their dynamics. Hence we \nhypothesize that the Whittaker interference of the propagating reordered (electromagnetic) energy entities, continuously \noccurring at any point in space, generates the zero-point (electromagnetic) field energy fluctuations of the vacuum itself. Indeed, \n(a) paper by Evans...has already shown that just such “scalar interferometry, ” produces transverse (electromagnetic) fields and \nwaves in the vacuum at a distance. — \n\nIn other words, one must imagine each of the scalar entities accompanying the vectors in the diagrams above as being composed of \nbi-directional longitudinal or “acoustic” waves in the medium. Thus, Whittaker “decomposes” the scalar entities into pairs of such \npressure waves or “stresses” in the medium. Combining, or “interfering” such waves thus causes the standard electromagnetic fields \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand waves observed in standard physics. And most importantly, this can be done “at a distance.” \n\nBut what does this mean? \n\nSimply put, since every atom and every type of atom consists of particles with charge and/or mass, then every atom has its own \npeculiar “scalar signature” or “resonance” (recall the diagrams above and imagine the mathematical notations that would describe \neach in quaternion geometry). Thus, to produce an effect on any one of these systems, one simply has to “work backwards” as it \nwere, and configure its scalar signature, decomposing each of the scalars into its own pair of bi-directional longitudinal pulses and \nwaves. \n\nOne may thus envision the innumerable types of “zero sum vector systems” like the diagram above as also being a kind of \ntemplate for action, or what Bearden calls a “causal system robot,” or CSR, a template for producing a desired outcome in a system \nat a distance by means of configuring resonance to its “scalar signature”: \n\nWith sufficient theoretical development, one can “work backwards” to obtain a desired causal system...corresponding to some \nphysical system.... One thereby creates a deterministic set of spacetime curvatures and impressed dynamics, which we call an \n“engine.”...By building in scalar interferometry functions, the CSR can be given “weapons” capabilities, etc.— \n\nThat is, one reproduces the “scalar” topological signature of the system one wants to influence (or destroy), and loads the appropriate \ninformation into it: \n\n(By) assembling the desired (longitudinal) wave biwave subsets, the two scalar potentials and their resulting interference- \nproduced carrier wave are internally structured as desired. This is the use of the so-called internal information content of the \nfield. We speak of a deliberately structured potential, field, or wave as having been conditioned, dimensioned, or activated. If \nthese terms are deemed inappropriate, just use the more generic term “internally structured.”— \n\nBy the well-known mass-energy conversion mechanism, mass and inertia are thus “the direct result of — and are — trapped scalar \nresonance.” But what is “trapped scalar resonance”? “The trapping mechanism is the spin of the particle,”— that is, the peculiar \ninternal rotating stresses or vorticies in the medium of various systems, diagramed in our simple example above !— \n\nMore than anything else, it is this ability to configure a template based upon the scalar signature and its long distance resonance \neffects in the medium that allows one to produce an action at a distance that best fills the bill for the “monstrous area of physics” that \nthe British intelligence agent disclosed to German researchers Mayer and Mehner. It is, indeed, a very sophisticated form of magic, \nand sympathetic magic at that. \n\nFor the result of this new physics is that space itself has structure and content, the medium or “aether” may be viewed as nothing \nbut a vast set of scalar potentials, which can be decomposed into longitudinal wave pairs.— And since a “scalar” represents an \ninternal rotational stress — as per our diagrams above - scalar physics is also not only non-linear, but vorticular physics. \n\n\n2. Bearden’s Claims for “Scalar” Physics and its Weaponization \n\n\na. The Dangers of Scalar Resonance: Planet-Busting “Doomsday ” Implications \n\n\nIn addition to a superb defensive capability, there is a far more ominous offensive capability. Since, as has been seen, “scalar \nwaves pass through the electron shells of an atom and interact with the nucleus” directly, this means that “they are continually \nabsorbed and emitted by all nuclei in the universe.” Consequently, “any large collection of nuclei — such as a star or a planet — is a \nstrong absorber and radiator of scalar wave radiation.”— One cannot ponder this too long nor overestimate its importance, for it \nmeans that any large mass such as a planet is a natural resonator of such waves, and this means any scalar weapon has a planetary¬ \nsized potential destructive power: \n\n(This) scalar coupling of the solar system provides a major check on unrestricted use of the large Soviet strategic scalar EM \nweapon systems. If significant scalar effects are produced on earth in a “pulse” mode, pulsed disturbance of the earth-sun and \nearth-moon system results. Here a danger exists that one or more natural resonances of the coupled systems may be excited. If \nthe feedback stimulation of the Sun is not insignificant, for example, large sunspot activity may result sometime thereafter, say \nin a day or two. If too much or too sharp stimulation occurs on earth, the coupled resonant response from the sun could be \ndisastrous. Indeed, a solar response could be stimulated so that the Sun would violently belch and destroy our biosphere, among \nother effects. The simplest doomsday stimulation would be for a violent expulsion of Solar (electromagnetic) energy and \nparticles to occur. If this were due to resonance, the expulsion of Solar (electromagnetic) energy and particles would continue \nduring some decay time. In that case, fiery destruction of the earth, strongly indicative of Biblical prophecy, would result.... \n\nAccordingly, use of huge scalar (electromagnetic) weapons is a double-edged sword. Unless carefully employed, use of the \nweapons could cause a terrible backlash to the user as well as the victim, and even accidentally cause the destruction of the \nearth itself.— \n\nOne may even envision the use of a scalar weapon to acoustically oscillate an entire planet beyond its ability to damp the enormous \ncascade of quantum potential energy to the point that it would explode.— Bearden himself is quite alive to this disturbing potential \nfor the weapons: \n\n(If) the discharge happens to tickle the Sun and Moon’s feedback loops the wrong way, you’ll get convulsions of the earth, \nmighty burps of the sun raining fire and brimstone on the earth, and a violent increase in the interior heat of the earth ’s molten \ncore, with a concomitant eruption of that core right up through the mantle.... \n\n(Whenever) one activates a large scalar (electromagnetic) weapon, one immediately places the entire earth in deadly peril. \n\nThe slightest misstep, and it’s curtains for everyone. And it’s curtains for the earth as well. \n\nIt takes only a little imagination to see that this principle could be pressed even farther, to the inability of the planet to damp its \nviolent, scalar-induced acoustic cavitation. The planet would consume itself in a violent explosion making a hydrogen bomb look \nlike a firecracker. \n\nBut in any case, as Bearden makes abundantly clear, scalar weapons possess planet-busting potential. \n\nThis in turn corroborates yet another seemingly fantastic assertion that Gennan researchers Mayer and Mehner made in their own \ninvestigations of the Nazi atom bomb. Commenting on the allegations of the anonymous British intelligence agent that tipped them \noff that the SS was working on far more than mere a-bombs and h-bombs, but in areas of physics that seemingly “totally abandoned \nconventional physical laws,\"— they then go on to comment on this revelation as follows: \n\nThis could only mean that there was a weapons system that possessed enormous range and degree of efficiency that lay beyond \nthat of nuclear weapons technology. Did the Third Reich really prepare the Doomsday Weapon? And if so, where is this \ntechnology today? Was it discovered by the Allies or does it lurk secretly deep in the earth waiting for its rediscovery? Is such \nan Ultimate Weapon has already been in existence for more than fifty years, then it is a legitimate question to ask what today’s \nmilitary really, actually possesses.— \n\nSuch planet-busting potential over the vast stellar distances of the solar system would seem to be the best and most viable candidate \n\n\nto fulfill this role for it is the only physics that lay within the possibilities of the then existent technology that had the requisite \ndestructive power and enormous range. Additionally, as will be argued subsequently here, there is every indication that this type of \nphysics is exactly what is being presented in the technology of the Bell and various other experiments the Nazis were conducting. \n\n\nb. The Scalar Template and Weapons Applications \n\nIt will be recalled that any physical object, from an atom of any particular element, to planets, has a “scalar signature” that is \nunique to it. Thus, the notion of a “template” containing information loaded into that scalar signature — or one might say “modulated \nby it” — means that scalar physics is an extremely flexible physics. Depending on the configuration of the signature and the amount \nof power used, one might induce beneficial biological or psychological effects at a distance, as well as being able to induce disease, \ndisordered or traumatic psychological states, alter weather, or, indeed, draw energy out of a target and “freeze” it to death, or slowly \nload energy into it and cook it, or instantaneously blow up an entire region of an enemy country. The template is a kind of “scalar \nmagician’s” pentagram, with its incantations and formulas (equations) producing the desired action from a distance from the system \none wishes to influence.— \n\n\n3. The Implications of Bearden’s Reconstruction of the History of Scalar Physics \n\n\nThus far, Bearden’s speculative history of Soviet scalar weapons development is clear enough, and the reason for Stalin’s \nmotivations in pursuing them are clear and plausible. But as I noted in The Giza Death Star Deployed, there was also another source \nfeeding the Soviet interest. This source raises certain questions about the actual Soviet capabilities, and where they actually came \nfrom. In his seminal work on the subject of scalar weapons, Fer De Lance, Bearden states that “Beside Russia, two other nations — \nBrazil and (a) ‘little friendly nation’ — also had developed quantum potential weapons.”— A little further on, he adds the following \nvery significant details: \n\nBrazil implemented an energetics weapons program after it employed the repatriated Dr. Hellmann, a German scientist \ntaken to Russia after WW II along with the German radar team. Years after being taken to Russia, Hellmann was \nrepatriated and made his way back to Germany. In a news interview Hellmann reported that he had worked directly on \nthe development of Soviet secret EM weapons which could suddenly freeze large areas of the ocean surface. That of \ncourse is a scalar interferometry weapon, producing negative (converging) EM energy rather than a positive (diverging) EM \nenergy in their distant interference. Also, when the U.S. made David Bohm persona non grata in the McCarthy witch-hunts, \nBohm was later employed in lecturing and teaching in Brazil for some time. At the time our own scientists continued to \npontificate as to whether they liked or could tolerate Bohm’s quantum potential and his hidden variable interpretation of \nquantum mechanics. Meanwhile, the KGB weapon scientists and the Brazilian Hellmann project seized upon Bohm’s \nhidden variable theory with alacrity as soon as he published his seminal paper. Those two weapon groups were already \nfamiliar with the internal longitudinal EM wave structuring of potentials, fields, and waves (Whittaker 1903), and \nimmediately saw the fantastic weapons implications of a deliberately structured quantum potential, containing a \nspecific “engine” as desired. Most of our scientists still are unaware of it to this day, and are unaware of its formidable weapon \nimplications when combined with Whittaker’s 1904 superpotential paper, his 1903 potential decomposition, and quantum field \ntheory.— \n\n\nA number of very important points emerges from this series of revelations: \n\n1. Hellmann was apparently one of the Nazi scientists, a part of a “radar team” brought to the Soviet Union in their own \n“Operation Paperclip” style use of former Nazi scientists to fuel their own secret weapons projects after the war; \n\n2. Hellmann disclosed that he had been involved in development of Soviet electromagnetic weapons that could freeze large \nareas of the oceans’ surface, a clear signature of scalar weaponry in its “endothermic energy extraction” mode of deployment; \n\nfinally, and most importantly, \n\n3. Bearden implies that not only were the Soviets aware of Whittaker’s mathematical papers and their profound implications, \n\nbut that the Nazis were as well. \n\nThis is a clear indicator that the Nazis may have been behind the initial development of the theory of scalar electromagnetic physics \nand the first prototypical scalar devices and weapons. \n\nWhile Hellmann’s claims about freezing vast areas of the oceans’ surface sound wild and fantastic, what is even more important is \nthe fact that similar research was undertaken by the Nazis during World War Two into the development of a “cold bomb,” a “bomb” \nthat would in effect drain the energy from a region.— This clearly implies a theoretical basis in scalar electromagnetics, but even \nmore importantly, this implies that the theoretical and initial experimental research were already begun by Nazi Germany. Thus, the \nSoviets did not, after all, achieve their breakthrough. They borrowed it from the Nazis. Moreover, as was indicated in Reich of the \nBlack Sun, the Nazis had expressed an interest in Dr. Nowak’s “molecular bomb”, a bomb of great explosive power brought about \nby supercooling matter and then suddenly heating it.— Scalar electromagnetics would be the best and most efficient way of \naccomplishing both the necessary cooling and sudden heating and explosive expansion of matter. Finally, as I reported in my second \nbook on the “scalar” weapon hypothesis for the Great Pyramid, The Giza Death Star Destroyed, there was an event that occurred in \nearly 1943 on the Eastern Front, during the German retreat from Stalingrad, where an entire German regiment was wiped out after \nthe appearance of a strange “energy bubble” over the unit. The “bubble” exploded all the ammunition in the German regiment, \nwiping the unit out to a man. As I noted there, the circumstances of this strange event have all the hallmarks of a German secret \nweapons test of a decidedly scalar weapon, for needless to say, the “energy bubble” clearly has all the signatures of a scalar \nweapon.— \n\n\nSuch “bubbles” or glowing plasmas of ionized atmosphere are clear signatures of “scalar” weapons at low power usage, as \nBearden clearly states: \n\n(There) is another incident of a gigantic test of a Soviet scalar EM howitzer deep within the Soviet Union. \n\nThis is a CIA report, released under the Freedom of Information Act. One can be quite sure that the incident occurred as \nstated. \n\nThe phenomenon was seen from two aircraft approaching Mehrabad Airport in Teheran, Iran on June 17, 1966 and reported \nby their pilots. \n\nOn the far horizon deep within the Soviet Union, an intense spherical ball of light appeared, “sitting on the horizon” so to \nspeak, the globe of light increased to enormous size, dimming as it did so, literally filling an arc of the distant sky as it \nexpanded. The sighting was shielded from most ground observers’ view at the airport itself due to an intervening mountain \nrange that masked most of the phenomenon from the ground. \n\nThe silent, expanding globe was observed for four or five minutes before it faded away. \n\nAgain, this is positive evidence of the testing of a giant scalar EM interferometer, in the “midcourse ABM globe” type of \naction. \n\nHowever, note the date — mid 1966! The Soviets have therefore been testing such scalar weapons of enormous size and \npower for at least two decades. This implies that development must have started at least a decade earlier, or in the mid ‘50S.— \n\nBy “_midcourse ABM globe type of action’” Bearden is referring to the ability of scalar weapons to create a highly charged \n“bubble” that would scramble or knock out the electronics of any vehicle or missile entering it. This alone would have made scalar \nweapons an invaluable prize to the Soviets — or anyone else for that matter — for it would render one’s opponent’s missiles and \nnuclear warheads so much dead and useless mass, and accordingly, give all that much more weight to one’s own nuclear deterrent. \n\nBut this is only a circumstantial argument that the Nazis were after scalar weapons. To make such a case stronger, one would have \nto find evidence that Nazi scientists and their conceptions were the feedstock to this Soviet scalar weapons project. Bearden confirms \nthe worst by offering the following information: \n\nOne of my close colleagues has validated that the German radar team had some severe instrumental anomalies while still in \nGermany. We think this is what they were: \n\nIn WWII the Germans invented radar absorbing materials, to coat their submarine snorkels and prevent Allied \nantisubmarine warfare bombers from tracking the snorkels and destroying the subs. A wide variety of highly \nnonlinear, doped materials were investigated. In addition to single beam radar cross section, the Germans also \nexamined the materials in multi-beam illumination circumstances. \n\nIt appears that, in some multibeam experiments with some materials, conditions were just right so that the multi- \nilluminated absorbing material acted as a pumped phase conjugate mirror (PCM), and wave-to-wave interactions \nemerged. This meant that the absorber material PCM would suddenly gather up all the energy in the pumping beams, \nuse one of the other beams as a signal input beam, wrecking the experiment and creating havoc in surrounding \nequipment. \n\nWhen the German radar team went to Russia, their knowledge of these anomalies went with them. In the desperate Russian \nscientific climate to find just such anomalies, this startling and anomalous phenomenon would have been exhaustingly \nexamined and studied, once the German radar engineers got to Russia to their new laboratories. \n\nIn short, it appears that the Russians quickly came up with what today is called “nonlinear phase conjugate optics,” but first \nin the radar band rather than optics. So before 1950, it appears that the Russians already had working phase conjugating \npumped phase conjugate mirrors for the radar bands and in other bands.— \n\nNow observe carefully the implications of Bearden’s remarks. \n\nFirst, the phenomenon of phase conjugate mirrors was a direct result of late war German radar experiments on highly non-linear \nradar absorbent materials (RAM) that they had invented during the war for their U-boats.— This is as much as admitting, in a round \nabout fashion, that it was not the Soviets that came up with it, but the Nazis. \n\nSecondly, it is to be noted that Bearden clearly implies that the Nazi radar team stumbled across the phenomenon accidentally. We \nshall offer evidence — when we turn to a consideration of the speculative physics of the Bell itself — that the Nazis were not blindly \nstumbling about in quest of a breakthrough, but rather, pursuing all available means to acquire scalar technology and weapons. Their \ndiscovery was therefore not accidental. They were looking for it. \n\nThirdly, if it is the case that the Nazi radar team’s observed anomalies were merely the result of happenstance, then there is an \n\n\nimplicit contradiction between Bearden’s remarks here, and my earlier remarks implying that both the Soviets and the Nazis were \nsurely aware of E.T. Whittaker’s 1903 paper describing the decomposition of the scalar potential into two opposing longitudinal \nwaves. \n\nIn other words, if Bearden’s case that the Soviets developed scalar weapons is based upon \n\n1. Strange installations or devices having no conventional explanation; \n\n2. Strange effects being observed that can only be signatures of a scalar physics and its associated technologies; \n\n3. The crucial role of wave-mixing on non-linear materials such as in the late war German radar experiments; \n\n4. The equally crucial role of rotating non-translational vorticular systems in scalar physics theory; \n\n5. A speculative reconstruction of the history of scalar physics based upon probable reconstructions of forgotten physics papers \nsuch a Whittaker’s, surely known to the Nazis as well as the Soviets; and, \n\n6. Research and Review Institutions or “think tanks” in the Soviet Union scouring western physics journals for an area for \nbreakthrough and weaponization into a post-nuclear super-weapon, \n\nthen by the same token, and as should be now equally apparent, all these things are equally true of the wartime situation of Nazi \nGermany, and clearly signatures of Kammler’s special “think tank.” But one must go further than this: every obser\\>ed effect of scalar \ndevices finds an earlier echo in events during the Second World War , and the only known experiments that could be construed as \nhaving scalar characteristics were conducted by the Nazis. In my opinion then, this means that the case for a Nazi origin of scalar \nweapons is much stronger than for a Soviet one. \n\nSo, might the Nazi radar team’s experiments have been deliberately looking for such an effect? Might the radar team have been \nyet another component of the same project represented by the Bell? While there is no direct evidence, there are a number of factors \nthat would seem to argue persuasively that this is indeed the case. To understand why, we need only look more closely at the Nazi \nradar absorbent material itself, and what the radar team was initially looking for, and the theory of radar that it implied the Germans \nwere working with. As we shall see, it is a theory profoundly different from the standard theory of radar as a “bounce” of a signal \nfrom a reflecting target. \n\nAs was described in Reich of the Black Sun, some of this radar absorbent material consisted of rubber, into which small iron and \nzinc balls of specific diameter had been pressed during molding. These balls were resonant to certain frequencies known to be used \nby British and American radar. In the earliest materials, only certain frequencies would be “absorbed” by the material. The Germans \nknew that eventually the Allies would change their frequencies, and thus the material would be useless. Hence it became necessary \nthat the newer radar absorbent material be absorbent to a wider band of frequencies, and hence the need to test several frequencies \non this material. But now notice that the German team is interfering several beams of different frequencies on this material. This \nmeans, in short, that they have realized two things that are not part of the theory of radar in any standard text to this day: (1) that \nradar is not a “bounce” as much as the target itself is a “secondary transmitter” resonant to certain frequencies. The radar signal \nthus stimulates a current within the target via resonance, and this then is transmitted back to the radar antenna where the amplifier \namplifies it; (2) by interfering several frequencies on the same target composed of radar absorbent material capable of absorbing \ndifferent frequencies, they are trying to determine if nonetheless a secondary transmitter effect results, nullifying the material’s stealth \nproperties. In short, this means that they were expecting some sort of “anomalous return” to their antennae. What exceeded their \nexpectations, in other words, was not the result, but its intensity. This further implies that they might also have been aware of the role \nof longitudinal waves as a means to achieve the phenomenon. \n\nTo sum up, the nature of the experiment’s configuration suggests that the Nazis were well aware of “scalar physics” and its \npeculiar properties, for they clearly perceived radar as a “resonance-and-secondary-transmitter” effect, and not merely a “bounce.” In \nother words, even to have conceived of such an experiment, the Nazi radar research team had to have known that all material, \nincluding highly non-linear material, has a resonance. Thus no “stealth” material is really “stealthy” if one knows how to induce a \nsecondary transmitter effect through resonance and interferometry. This is about as far from “public consumption physics” as one \ncan get. \n\n\na. Back to “Freya” and See-ElefantThe German Over-The-Horizon Radars \n\n\nThe Germans were developing, very early on, a number of early, proto-typical over-the-horizon long range radars capable of \nguiding their intercontinental missiles to target. The following are diagrams of the Freya system from the German Museum in \nMunich: \n\n\nSchematic of the Envisioned Use of Freya for Rocket Guidance \n\n\n\n\nArtist’s Conception of the Mobile Freya Unit Deployed \n\n\n\nNote now that in the artist’s conception of the radar unit, the central antenna, labeled number four in the drawing, is labeled a Sende- \nu.Empfangs-Antenna, a sending and receiving antenna, while two other Sende antennae are located to either side of this central \nantenna (the antenna on the left is obscured in the reproduction, being barley visible in the black smudge on the center of the \npicture). In other words, Freya had three sending antennae, one of which doubled as a receiving antenna. This system is somewhat \nobscured in the schematic of the drawing, which, if one studies it closely though, also indicates that the radar unit’s two “side” \nantenna are sending pulses. \n\nWhy is this three-antenna sending system so important? And what does it have to do with scalar weapons? First, such plural \nsending antennae would have been necessary for a simple, prototypical phased array radar. If each antenna sends out a pulse slightly \nout of phase with the pulses from the other antenna, the result is that the signal of the whole apparatus can be caused to “bend” or \n“shape” itself in a certain way, and hence, one can bend the signal to look “over the horizon.” \n\nBut as has been noted already by Col. Bearden, the other thing such radar sets can do is interfere electromagnetic waves on \nnonlinear material, creating the longitudinal or scalar wave in the medium. Thus, such radar devices are potential proto-typical scalar \nweapons, as the following diagram of Bearden of a scalar device sending out two pulses, not only out of phase but indeed, at \ndifferent times and velocities. The pulses only overtake each other on the target, producing the longitudinal wave: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBearden’s Diagram of a Scalar Weapon Pulse \n\n\n\nTULA HOUWTZIP* \n\n\nlaCALAft »<TMfWO«rTWl \n\n\nAs any cursory examination of Bearden’s diagram with the wartime German schematic of Freya will attest, there is little basic \nconceptual difference between the two types of operation. \n\nWhile this is not to suggest that Freya was a scalar weapon, it is clear that such phased array radars constitute the first elements in \nsuch a system, for by simple reconfiguration, one may advance from the idea of out-of-phase pulses to out-of-phase pulses-fired at \ndifferent times and arriving on target at the same time. In other words, it is not the hardware that changes, it is the template for \naction that changes. It would have been a small step for the Germans to make the change, and, as has already been indicated, this \nappear to be exactly what happened in their late-war radar experiments on radar absorbent material (RAM). \n\nBut is there any other corroboration of the claims of this chapter? \n\n\nb. An Odd Allied Intelligence Report Indicating the Nazi Operation of Scalar Weapons \n\n\nThe destruction of a German regiment on the Russian front in 1943 by what appears to be a scalar weapons test— remains \nspeculative. But there is again another indicator from a declassified American intelligence document. The document was uncovered \nby German researcher Friedrich Georg: \n\n\nSECRET \n\n\nPW INTELLIGENCE BULLETIN no 2/32 \n\n\n13. Fantasia: German Secret Weapons \n\nPreamble. The following stories are from sources of doubtful reliability and may well be pure products of the imagination. \nHowever, in view of the striking similarity between them, they are printed for what they are worth. \n\nFirst Story \n\n\nAround 15 Sept 44, CP of 1127 Gren Regt 559 Inf Div was in REINANGE at GSGS 4416/U1/912797. It was a warm \nsunny day with a few scattered clouds and no wind. About 1600 PW— was standing near the church in REINANGE and \nobserved a formation of Allied aircraft pass, flying from SW to NE, low enough to be recognized as four-motored planes. He \ncounted up to 30 planes. They were flying in close formation. \n\nWhile PW watched them pass by, he saw what he believed to be a small fighter plane (grey color, no identification marks) \nclimb and approach the Allied formation from an easterly direction. PW states that the “fighter plane” was flying at abnormally \nhigh speed at that it penetrated into the midst of the formation apparently without being fired at. Suddenly there appeared, \nwhere the “fighter plane ” had been before, a red ball of fire, somewhat larger than the plane itself A split second later, the \nball of fire turned into a rapidly expanding red circle (parallel to the ground). This circle was bluish-red at its edge, and as its \ndiameter increased, the interior of the sVircle became an empty space. As the circle enveloped the planes, they just seemed to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisappear. In a matter of seconds the entire formation of Allied planes had disappeared, and the sky was just as it had been \nbefore. \n\nPW discussed the incident with several others who witnessed it, including a Hptm— of 1559 Arty Regt.— This officer \n(who was subsequently killed) told him that the “fighter plane ” in question was a wooden miniature plane with a speed of over \n1000 km per hour and which was operated by remote control. The name of the plane is KOMET. The Hptm told him that he \nhad lived near an airfield where such planes were tested and that he had recognized it at once. \n\n(Source: Werner LUTMER, UFFZ. HQ 1127 Gren Regt) \n\nHITLER’S Plans. About 10 Oct 44, the CP of 1127 Gren Regt was visited by the 1 st general staff officer (I-a7) of XIII SS \nCorps (an Oberstlt, name unknown). PW talked for about 10 to 15 minutes to this officer’s driver, a Rottenfuehrer, who told \nhim the following: \n\nHe, the Rottenfuehrer, had overheard a conversation between the general staff officer and HITLER and HIMMLER, who \nhad nvisited the XIII SS Corps HQ a few days before. During the conversation he had overheard HITLER say that “the new \nsecret weapon” would not be employed until a 24 hour mastery of the air and sea could be guaranteed. HIMMLER is supposed \nto have added that another prerequisite was a temperature of 10 degrees below 0. \n\n(Source: ibidp^ \n\n\nThe Allied Intelligence Report Indicating Possible German Use of Scalar Device \n\n\n\nSS* o n * r \n\n\npr»« t>l«.

Either it remained classified through \nsimple bureaucratic inertia and the sheer mountain of material at the U.S. National Archives awaiting declassification review, or \nthere was a reason to keep it declassified for so long. In my opinion, it is the latter, and that brings us to the third thing about this \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument. \n\nNote that the final anecdote about Hitler and Himmler having an idle conversation about secret weapons and the need to ensure a \n24 hour mastery of the air and sea occurs at approximately the same time as the alleged Nazi a-bomb testing the Baltic, ca. 10-11 \nOctober 1944. At that point, successful delivery of an a-bomb to any Allied strategic target could only have been accomplished by a \nLuftwaffe bomber, since the V-2 and V-l would not have had the ability to lift such a heavy weapon, nor the range to deliver it to \nany worthwhile Allied target. Hence, the last anecdote makes sense. \n\nBut it is the first story that contains the reason for keeping this document under wraps for so long. Notably, two elements are not \n“pure fantasia,” since the Messerschmitt 163 “Komet” was in fact a small rocket plane capable of great speeds. Moreover it had a \ndistinctive shape that, once an individual had seen one, would have allowed it to be readily identified. So this element rings true. \n\nThe second element that is not “pure fantasia” is the “cloud” apparently fired by the “fighter plane” at the Allied formation. This \nhas all the hallmarks of the “Kugelblitz” system first detailed by Renato Vesco, a gas that was used to ignite or neutralize Allied \nignitions. \n\nBut here the connections to known German secret weapons projects end, for the “cloud” then behaves in a most nn -gas-like \nmanner. It neither explodes, nor do the Allied planes’ ignitions explode or simply stop. There are no planes falling from the sky, no \ncrashes on the ground, no debris, no nothing. However, the signatures of the “gas cloud” are remarkably similar to the glowing \nglobes that apparently annihilated a German regiment on the Eastern Front in 1943, and remarkably similar as well to similar globes \nspotted by various pilots near the former Soviet Union and adduced by Bearden as demonstrations of scalar weapons systems by the \nRussians The report is clear: the Allied planes simply disappeared. So we have, from an unlikely source, yet another indicator \nthat Nazi Germany most likely was developing scalar physics and scalar weapons as a component of its most sensitive and secret \nweapons projects. \n\n\n4. Conclusions and A Post-War Scalar Postscript: the “Scalar Weapons ” Nations and Germany \n\n\nIt is significant that Bearden initially maintained that in addition to the Soviet Union there were three other nations possessing \nscalar weapons. More recently, Bearden maintains that \n\nA friendly little foreign nation does have such weapons including (quantum potential) weapons that operate in multiply \nconnected spacetime.... That little nation has been responsible for our continued survival and has continued to deter the planned \nKGB strategic energetics strikes upon the West. There are indications... that at least one - and possible two - other friendly \nWestern nations also possesses such weapons. — \n\nOne can only surmise — though it is rather obvious — that the “friendly little nation” Bearden refers to is Israel. \n\nThe reason why it most likely is Israel requires some explanation. In my second book on the Great Pyramid Weapon Hypothesis, \nThe Giza Death Star Deployed, I argued that these three nations were most likely France, Japan, and the then West Germany.— \n\nAs argued there, West Germany would have pressing geopolitical and military reasons for developing such weapons, since it \ncould never hope to offset the American and Russian — not to mention French and British - preponderance in nuclear and \nthermonuclear weapons, even if it chose to develop its own atomic and hydrogen bombs. Additionally, West Germany had \noutstanding treaty obligations against the development of atomic weapons.— Scalar weapons were not covered in these treaties, and \nthus afforded the fastest and cheapest method for Germany to acquire strategic weapons that would level the super-power dominated \nplaying field. Their existence in the contemporary German arsenal would also explain two recent events: first, the recent decision of \nthe German government to take all of its nuclear power plants out of commission, since the “left over plutonium” would no longer be \nneeded for any bombs;— and secondly, the sudden “reunification” of the two Germanies after a series of devastating earthquakes hit \nthe Soviet Union in 1989.— In other words, Germany may have sent the weakened Soviet Union a clear “scalar message” not to \ninterfere in the reunification.— \n\nBut all these were merely circumstantial arguments and speculations. Is there any hard evidence to suggest that Germany actually \nis one of the early “scalar weapons” powers? \n\nIndeed there is, and it comes from Bearden himself. Very early on in his research, Bearden “upped” the number of nations \npossessing scalar weapons, or what he called “Triad” nations, from three to approximately ten nations: \n\nSome 10 nations, for example, now have scalar interferometry weapons, and even the Japanese Yakuza has them and also has \ntheir own facilities for producing them in Japan, including small portable units developed for use in assassination and terrorist \ntype warfare within a targeted nation - the United States of America.— \n\nFor now the enormous implications of an independent criminal syndicate possessing such weapons must be put aside. We shall \nreturn to the subject when we consider the problem of independent Nazi survival and continued independence of their black projects. \n\nFor now, it is to be noted that the number of “scalar deterrent” nations has considerably expanded, and this in turn leads us to \nconsider the South African, Israeli, and West German a-bomb program. Indeed, Bearden himself points the finger in this direction: \n\nAccording to (syndicated newspaper columnists Jack) Anderson and (Lee) Van Atta, a South African navy contingent was “in \nthe area” (of the test) at the time of the 1979 Vela (satellite) detection, and Israel and South Africa were cooperating on an \natomic bomb project as early as 1966. Apparently U.S. announcement of an impending South African atomic test in the \nKalahari Desert in 1977 led to such outcry that the test was suspended. Anderson and Van Atta cite succeeding visits to South \nAfrica by Israeli scientists, technicians, and defense officials. However, since the actual Vela detections showed some \ndeviations from what would be expected from nuclear tests, one can speculate that Anderson and Van Atta have presented \nevidence for the development of scalar electromagnetic weapons by two additional countries.— One may further speculate that \nthis could reveal what has been checking the Soviets from simply moving against the West with scalar electromagnetic \n\n424 \n\nweapons. \n\nWhile columnist Jack Anderson knew that there was a hidden “third partner” in the Israel-South Africa project, he was never able to \npin down who it was with any certainty. But with the research of Zdenek Cervenka’s and Barbara Rogers’ book The Nuclear Axis: \nthe Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and South Africa, we now know that this hidden partner was West Germany. \n\nThus, if Bearden is correct, that the Vela satellite detected not an atomic explosion, but an explosion brought about as the result of \na scalar weapons test, then the conclusion follows that Germany was, from that point on, a “scalar weapons power.” \n\n\nIf this is the case, then one is confronted with a disturbing pattern, for it would appear that scalar weapons research was begun by \nNazi Germany at some point prior to or during the World War, and essentially continued by the same personnel — in various \ncountries and at their expense, including Germany itself — after the war. This in turn permits one to speculate that perhaps all these \ndisparate “scalar weapons” projects and its “not for public dissemination” physics were coordinated from some hidden center. \n\nIn any case, we are now in a position to summarize why Bearden’s historical reconstruction of the development of scalar weapons \nmust be amended to show their origin, not in post-war Soviet programs, but in wartime Nazi Germany’s secret weapons black \nprojects. \n\na. First, there are the references to Nazi Germany’s interest in building a “cold bomb,” and Hellmann’s assertions that the \nSoviets were constructing a weapon to freeze portions of the ocean. Such “endothermic” weapons are clear signatures of a \nscalar weapon being used in its mode of extracting energy from a distant point. \n\nb. Secondly, there is the report of the annihilation of a German regiment by an “energy bubble” on the Eastern Front during \nWorld War Two. As was indicated, this too is the signature of a scalar weapon in yet a different mode of deployment. \n\nc. Thirdly, there is the peculiar nature of the late war German experiments in multi-wave interference of radar waves on non¬ \nlinear material, an experiment that strongly indicates that they have understood the significance of resonance effects on non¬ \nlinear material for scalar physics. \n\nd. Fourthly, there is the presence of one of the chief scientists involved in these radar and scalar weapons projects, Dr. \nHellmann, both in the German, Soviet, and subsequent Brazilian programs. \n\nTaken together these things outline a strong circumstantial case that Nazi Germany was the true origin of scalar weapons, and that \nduring the war the Germans were indeed “working in areas of physics that were monstrous on a daily basis,” pursuing the ultimate \nplanet busting doomsday weapon. And significantly, it appears that West Germany, at least, vigorously pursued such weapons after \nthe wear.— \n\nThis is a strong though still circumstantial case. Is there any other indicator that “scalar physics” was the destructive beast hidden \ndeep within the belly of SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler’s black projects empire? Indeed there is. \n\nThe Bell itself. \n\n\nSo, in the end, Bearden may be right that the Vela satellites detected not an atom bomb test, but a scalar weapons test. He merely \nmissed the ultimate political significance of the test, namely, that behind Israel and South Africa, there was a much more powerful \nhidden player: Germany. \n\n\n6 . \n\n\n„For whom the Bell Colls“: Scalar Physics, Zero Point Anergy, and the particular Aether: A Speculatibe \n\nReconstruction of the Physics of the Bell \n\n\n“The mythology and true history of beamray technology properly begins with the Egyptians, whose awareness of vitalistic \nsolar energies prompted a pagan devotion to “Ra ’’the sun-god. ” \n\nGerry Vassilatos, Declassified Patents of the Cold War and SDt^=^- \n\n\nA. US Declassified Patents from the Cold War and SDI \n\n\nIn an obscure but nonetheless remarkable book, Declassified Patents of the Cold War and SDI, science and patent researcher \nGerry Vassilatos outlines an incredible array of exotic weaponry that exists in recently declassified United States patents. Vassilatos’ \nown introduction to this highly technical material is itself worth the price of the book, for in it, he details a number of little known \nadvances in experimental physics well worth study, and moreover, that bear directly on some aspects of the Bell and its operation. \n\nObviously, the subject of Vassilatos’ investigation is the field of SDI, President Ronald Reagan’s well-known Strategic Defense \nInitiative,— and more particularly, the exotic directed energy weapons that were envisioned as being capable not only of defensive \naction against enemy ICBMs, but ultimately, of replacing them as the new generation of post-thermonuclear strategic offensive \nweapons. \n\nWork had already begun during World War Two on the use of X-rays and gamma rays in “burst” devices that would fire a \nsudden extreme pulse of the deadly high frequency radiation at a target. But in the aftermath of the war and the advent of the nuclear \nage, particularly after the Soviet Union acquiring its own atomic and hydrogen bombs, the need for some sort of defense against \nthem became immediately felt. \n\nOne of the first efforts to improve on the “burst” devices came in 1957, with a patent from the German Siemens firm — US Patent \nNumber 2,904, 692, by inventor Wilhelm Gscheidlen — for the collimation of gamma rays by means of a series of metal baffles \nwith pin-hole sized holes, arranged sequentially, to achieve a lensing effect that would concentrate high frequency gamma photons \ninto a beam, using a cobalt 60 source.— \n\nBut as Vassilatos notes, “such systems lost much of their initial energy before passing through the multiple baffles of the \ncollimator itself. Ultimately, these pinhole camera systems failed from inherent problems of fundamental incoherence from the source \nitself, an intriguing engineering problem requiring the discovery of new phenomena for its solution.”— That is, the sources of \ngamma rays in these systems was rather like a light bulb, emitting gamma rays of various frequencies. No matter how efficient the \ncollimator baffle system, the beam would still spread out — like a “gamma ray flashlight” beam — and thereby lose much of its \nenergy. The goal was for gamma ray coherence, a gamma ray laser whose awesome power can only be appreciated by comparison \nto ordinary optical lasers, which can cut through steel with ordinary light. \n\nThe next step was taken in the early 1960s, with so-called Clear Atomic Light” systems, which relied on a system of underground \ntunnels and a reflecting mirror able to direct the light generated from a nuclear explosion to the surface through a tunnel in a \nconcentrated beam. Such systems, in other words, took the radiation from a nuclear explosion and directed it in a beam. Needless to \nsay, using the weapon also destroyed it, since they could never be more than one shot affairs. Nevertheless, \n\nBefore the development of far better and more pernicious radiation weapons, this CAL (Clear Atomic Light) beam weapon had \nno equal. Its declassification in 1973 occurs some 15 years after its testing in coincidence with Project Plowshare, a “peacetime” \nuse of nuclear weaponry. These experimental weapons were part of PROJECT DEFENDER, the original Star Wars Defense \nInitiative of President Eisenhower. This Project investigated the use of directed hot nuclear plasmas (PROJECT CASABA), \nhigh energy particles (PROJECT HOWITZER), and primary experimentation with X and Gamma Ray LASERS.— \n\nThese CAL or Clear Atomic Light systems quickly moved out of their underground tunnels and bunkers and became more portable, \nand potentially space-based, weapons platforms. \n\nThe well-publicized X-ray laser systems of the early 1980’s were based on these early CAL systems, the small nuclear device \nbeing housed in a hemispherical or “tanklike” structure surrounded with rods of radioactive material. When the device is detonated, \nthe rods become transmitters of deadly cohered, or lasing, x-rays, incinerating anything in their path almost instantly. Given that a \nbeam of enormous diameter can be constructed with such a device, “one is able to produce” a high frequency, high power x-ray \nlaser beam “for the specific purpose of destroying missiles or cities alike. The length of the rods employed determines the \namplification factor.”— These weapons would have the additional advantage over more indiscriminate hydrogen bombs in that they \nwould leave no residual radioactive fallout in their targets. — \n\nThus, the engineers and scientists in America’s black projects were confronted with two unpleasant facts. On the one hand, the \nolder “electrical burst” method of generating such intense beams — the method pursued during the World War, while providing \nintense rays, also required the construction of enormous installations to generate the rays, thus rendering them impractical as \nweapons. On the other hand, x-ray lasers were deadly, of sufficient power to be used in an offensive strategic mode, and were far \nmore efficient than the indiscriminate atomic or hydrogen bomb. But they could only be used once, since firing the weapon also \ndestroyed it. \n\nYet another problem attended the pursuit of X-ray and gamma ray lasers (gamma ray lasers are often called GRASERS). Since \n\n\nthese high frequency radiations (gamma rays are much higher frequency than x-rays and hence pack even more of a punch) were \nable to permeate almost all forms of matter, creating an optical cavity to achieve coherence (the action that makes an ordinary laser \nbeam) for these frequencies was difficult. Ordinary mirrors and lenses did not effect x-rays or gamma rays. \n\nThe quest, in other words, had turned to reusable and “portable” x-ray and gamma ray lasers, for obvious reasons: “Becoming \noperative at the flick of a switch, these weapons represent potentially more of a threat than a single strike nuclear warhead. Any \nsingle electronuclear weapon can be fired repeatedly, the equivalent radiant firepower of several warheads.”— \n\nOne method was quickly found, employing the plasmas created by sudden vaporization of heavy metals with ordinary optical \nlaser light. Once having created a plasma of such material, this in turn was then pulsed with lasers to create an amplification and \ncascade effect that resulted in X-rays and gamma rays approaching coherent, or lased, nature.— “These ‘Z-Pinch’ plasma devices \nfire beams easily capable of melting clean holes directly through thick walls of metal and stone.”— \n\n\n1. Enter the Mossbauer Effect \n\n\nIt is in the search for reusable X-ray and gamma ray lasers that one encounters a physical effect that might bear directly on the \nphysical and theoretical thinking behind the Bell. The effect is known as the Mossbauer effect, and it concerns the relationship of \nacoustic and inertial stress and the effects of these on the gamma lasing activity of radioactive materials. It is best to cite Vassilatos \nextensively: \n\nWhile yet a graduate student, Dr. Rudolf Mossbauer (1959) discovered that specific radioactive elements could be stimulated \ninto gamma ray resonance. Mossbauer directed an external supply of monochromatic gamma rays into various radioactive \nisotopes, finding that they produced identical monochromatic outputs. This gamma resonant effect taught that certain \nradioactive isotopes could be stimulated to release more gamma rays than the amount delivered to them. Mossbauer found that \nhe could stimulate his isotopes into a supersaturated state by continually supplying them with the requisite quanta. Brought to a \nstate of supersaturation, Mossbauer observed the sudden release of gamma ray bursts several orders in magnitude greater than \nthe input. Furthermore, when properly directed, the gamma burst came as a single coherent emission. Mossbauer had found the \nmeans for creating a true gamma ray LASER. \n\nAfter Rudolf Mossbauer discovered the primary aspects of his strange effect, others began discovering its ancillary \n\nphenomena.Some experimenters disovered that the mere proximity of gamma absorbent matter near a gamma isotope source \n\neffectively modified the source, an anomaly. The coherent gamma emissions of Mossbauer resonant stimulations were strangely \nlinked to their absorbers, a relationship modified by motion alone. \n\nSpecial radioisotopes were rotated on special high speed rotors, demonstrating a phase modulation effect... Slotted shields \nwere made to rotate at high speed between isotope sources and absorbers, adding evidence that phase shifts were indeed \noccurring.... These findings strongly suggested the possibility of directly modulating Gamma Ray streams by movement \nalone.... (the) mere application of stress on the isotope samples was found to produce successions of powerful gamma ray \nbursts. Here was an unexpected “piezonuclear” corollary to the Mossbauer Effect. Isotope samples were applied to loudspeaker \ncones, and physically vibrated in the presence of absorbent materials....Indeed, certain experimenters discovered a strange effect \nof vibration upon the isotopes themselves. With applications of increasingly high pitch, the loudspeaker-fixed isotopes produced \ncontinual bursts of coherent gamma ray energy. Here was evidence that the mere compression of specific isotopic material \ncould produce an intense gamma supersaturation. What had been observed constituted an avalanche process, one capable of \norganizing coherent gamma emissions. \n\nThe application of audio signals (400 cps) caused remarkably intense gamma emission in these isotopes. It was soon found \nthat ultrasonic vibrations produced staggering gamma emissions....A growing wave of gamma photons is thus both stimulated \nand driven along by compressional waves alone.... \n\nResearchers who studied the compression phenomenon may not have been prepared for the resultant gamma yield when \nshock impact was applied to the isotopes. Huge coherent gamma ray bursts were produced throughout the small isotope core, a \nradiance which may have produced the first uncontrolled gamma ray “event”: an explosion of pure and penetrating gamma \nsuperradiance. The development of gamma burst “explosives” has well remained completely shrouded in secrecy,— \n\nWhat emerges from the Mossbauer Effect is that abrupt shock — acoustic or otherwise — of certain radioactive isotopes or \ncompounds can cause the emission of radiation to cohere, like a laser beam, giving off deadly effects. One can imagine then, in \nreference to the Bell, that if such radioactive material was spin polarized, and then repeatedly pulsed, what sort of deadly effect \nwould result. One might obtain a kind of “super GRASER.” \n\nIn any case, Mossbauer’s Effect had enormous implications for the development of strategic offensive directed energy weapons, \nfor the effect made reusable gamma ray lasers a possibility. But there were still obstacles to be overcome, and the one who did it was \nJosef Eerkens. \n\nEerkens (1962) discovered that the application of strong axial magnetic fields to rodshaped samples (of specific Lanthanides) \ncould produce a more highly coherent organization of gamma ray emissions. A “superradianf ’ beam was found to emerge from \nboth ends of such rods. The discovery that gamma ray emissions could be cohered in preferred directions was yet superseded \nby methods which actually effected the direction of gamma bursts through a single rod end. Eerkens found it possible to cause \nthe coherent gamma burst to emerge from a designated rod end, by pulsing the rod with gigacycle ultrasound. Producing \ntraveling compression waves in the isotope rod, it was found possible to actually direct the mounting gamma cascade from end \nto end. The powerful coherent gamma blast was thus capable of being directed, a previously unheard potential. \n\nIn the Eerkens design we see a true Gamma Ray LASER, or GRASER... Eerkens founds that the same radioactive materials \n\n\n\ncould be forced to discharge their radioactivity in sudden voluminous bursts when properly stimulated. This latter effect violated \nthe concept that radioactive half-life is an immutable constant, for it was found possible to control the decay rate by a special \n“enhancement process” involving acoustic energy....(The) frequencies necessary for the control of radioactivity is given as lying \nbetween 1 and 10,000 Gigacycles.— \n\nThat is, acoustically modifying and pulsing the environment was the method to stimulate gamma photon cascade and lasing action. \nIn other words, radioactivity is a reaction of an element to its environment. Moreover, the fact that this was achieved acoustically \nsuggests that the effect is a scalar one, since acoustic waves are the 3-space analogue of longitudinal waves in the medium. \n\n\nB. Plasmas, Rotation, Pulses, and Zero Point Energy \n\n\n\n1. Plasmas and Transmutation \n\n\nThere are further connections between the Bell and the strange world of alternative and suppressed physics, this time to one of the \nmost famous names in “alternative and suppressed” physics next to Nikola Tesla: T. Henry Moray. Moray, as many know, perfected \na device that seemed to draw energy from the active medium. Indeed, Moray spoke often and even wrote a book about the “limitless \nsea of energy” in which we move. And like Tesla, Moray designed his own devices, machines, and most importantly for our \npurposes, plasma tubes. \n\nThe later years of Moray’s research were dedicated to investigating a peculiar anomaly that occurred on the electrodes within \nhis plasma tubes: Some of the electrode metal would transmute to another element. It exhibited a nuclear reaction as if the \nnucleus absorbed a proton or emitted a beta particle. Because Moray was secretive about this research, little is known. A clue \nmight appear in Moray’s patent; there is one paragraph describing how to make a particular lead sulfide mixture to be used as \nelectrode material. Did Moray discover how to transmute lead into gold? The anomaly regarding transmutation of elements is \nhard to believe, except that it has been observed over the last decade in the cathodes from cold fusion experiments, and these \nexperiments are quite repeatable today.— \n\nNote here the appearance of nuclear transmutation — via some unknown mechanism — in the context of plasmas , yet another link \nto Gerlach and the Bell. \n\nBut there is yet more. Engineer Ken Shoulders made a significant discovery. Shoulders figured out a way to launch a kind of \n“coherent plasma” that is simply a “cluster of charges predominantly of one polarity,”— that is, Shoulders came upon the same \nprinciple of spin coherence, as exhibited in the Bell, since charge is a phenomenon of spin, of vortices. When such a “cohered \nplasma” strikes an aluminum plate, scanning by electron microscope reveals that the tiny crater made in the metal by the plasma \nimpact results in “transmuted isotopes” that are “unusual and rarely found in nature.”— Moreover, one may easily see that such \nprocesses might be identified — somewhat loosely to be sure — as “photochemical,” confirming the possibility that similar processes \nor phenomena were discovered by the Germans during the war, and giving rise to the baffling “photochemical” statements of isotope \nenrichment in the Farm Hall Transcripts. Moreover, the Farm Hall Transcripts made it clear — in Wirtz’s statement that was quickly \nhushed up by the other scientists — that the process involved “bombardment by a particular wavelength.” If the Bell was in part \nbeing used to research isotope enrichment or element transmutation, then its rotating operation clearly implies that one aspect of its \nconceptualization was precisely resonance, or frequency. Since Gerlach was interested in the subject of transmutation, one may \nsafely assume that the Bell was more than an advanced project in field propulsion. It was also an advanced project in the \nexamination of the basic structure of matter and how to transform it. It was thus a project designed to explore the potentialities of a \nunified physics. The question remains: what was the basis of that unification? \n\nThe uniqueness of the Bell is again manifest, even when compared to these contemporary examples, for the Bell, while clearly \ninvolving a plasma, and while clearly involving charge coherence or polarization, as in Shoulder’s work, involves clearly one other \naspect: counter-rotation, and with that, frequency, and the zeroing of electromagnetic vectors to create a scalar potential. \n\n\n2. Four Mysteries and Ion Oscillation \n\n\nAccording to physicist and engineer Moray B. King, T. Henry Moray himself understood that there were four big mysteries \nassociated with his machine: \n\n1) What is the energy source driving the device? 2) How can thin wires conduct “cold currents” that penetrate glass? 3) How \ncan a device pick up normal street conversations from miles away? 4) How can element transmutation occur at low energies? \nAll of these anomalies seem to center around surging or oscillating ions in plasma, a theme that Moray emphasized throughout \nhis book.— \n\n\nIn other words, Henry Moray understood that the four anomalies were connected to “oscillating plasma,” that is, to regularly pulsed \nplasma. But there are yet more possible conceptual foundations to the Bell. \n\n\n3. Paul Brown’s Glow Plasma Oscillator \n\n\nWhile reading Moray King’s The Energy Machine ofT. Henry Moray, I came upon this picture of Dr. Paul Brown’s “nuclear \nbattery” and was quite stunned at the strong conceptual — and actual physical — resemblance between it and the Bell. \n\nGlow Plasma Oscillator \n\n\n\nCapacitor in lid \n\n\nInner I ransformer \nCoils to take power \nto outside \n\n\nCentral ( oil with \nRadioactive \n\n\nOuter \n\nCoils \n\n\nCasing \n\n\nPaul Brown, U.S. Patent 4,835.433 (1989) \n\n\nNote the principle of interior and exterior coils, with the central coil, as in the Bell, being stimulated by a radioactive material. The \ncoils also imply that rotation was involved in Brown’s thinking from the outset. \n\nMoray King notes that \n\nGeneral Electric, in their due diligence for partnership to manufacture the battery, sent their nuclear physicist to investigate it. \nPaul Brown said the physicist lost sleep for a week because he could not explain the excessive energy. It was after this \ninvestigation that the suppression problems really began for Paul Brown, for it appears he successfully created self-running, \nzero-point energy device.— \n\nIf this can be said for Brown’s device, it is a small step to state the same of the Bell itself, since it operated on principles that, while \ncertainly not identical, were similar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Self-Organization \n\n\nIn my books on the Weapon Hypothesis as an explanation of the machine-like properties of the Great Pyramid,— I touched upon \nan aspect of the emerging new physics called “non-equilibrium thermodynamics.” The physics emerged from the pioneering work of \nIlya Prigogine, who noticed the tendency of systems, driven into extreme states of non-equilibrium, to self-organize. Three \nrequirements had to be present for any system to self-organize: \n\n1. It must be nonlinear, \n\n2. far from equilibrium, and \n\n3. have an energy flux passing through it. The theoretical models describing the zero-point energy fulfill these requirements. \nMerging the theories of the zero-point energy with the theories of system self-organization open the scientific possibility of \nactivating a coherent ZPE interaction, which could become a basis for new technology.— \n\nAs King observes, these requirements “point the way for inventing a system that could tap the zero-point energy:” \n\n1. Work with a highly nonlinear system like a plasma, \n\n2. drive it far from equilibrium by an abrupt discharge, and \n\n3. work with the appropriate elementary particles which maximize their influence when interacting with the zero-point \n\n445 \n\nenergy \n\nNote what is involved here: plasmas which are driven to a far-from-equilibrium state by an abrupt discharge or pulse, and particles, \nwhich, on the view of Wheeler and others — as will be seen below — are but vorticular structures in the aether. Two of the \nelements of the Bell are involved in this — plasmas and rotation — and, if one recalls the “beehive-like” buzzing sound associated \nwith the Bell, a sound characteristic of the rapid opening and closing of high voltage DC switches characteristic of Tesla’s \nexperiments, one may safely conjecture that a third element may have been involved as well, an element that Witkowski, as has been \nseen, discounts: abrupt and rapidly repeated high voltage DC pulsing. If this additional element was involved in the Bell — which \nin my opinion is likely — then this would mean that it was not only a sophisticated “plasma trap” but something more: it was a zero- \npoint energy device involving the use of two different types of electrical potential, continuous (AC) and discontinuous (DC).— As \nKing observes, any “abrupt motion of matter is a vacuum energy activator,”— since, in effect, one is pulsing a vortex in that \n\n\nvacuum. \n\n\n5. Oscillation of Plasma and ZPE Coherence \n\n\nThus one arrives at one possible reason behind the Bell itself: \n\nIf the abrupt motion of a single nucleus can activate the vacuum energy, what if we move a large number together? This is \nexactly what happens during ion-acoustic resonance of plasma.— \n\nThat is to say, if the Germans had managed to discover the low-energy transmutation phenomenon — and the Farm Hall Transcripts \nsuggest that they did — and if they coupled this idea to spin-cohered or charge-polarized plasma, as the research of Gerlach would \nconsistently suggest, then it is a very short step to the idea that the way to maximize the phenomenon would be via a large aggregate \nof matter — in a plasma — and to further stimulate that activity through pulsing of a radioactive substance, as the previous accounts \nof the Mossbauer effect demonstrate. \n\nAll these factors suggest that the Germans were experimenting with the very structure and fabric of matter, energy, gravity and \nspace-time with the Bell, and for various purposes: propulsion, weaponry, and so on. \n\n\n6. Gray’s Scalar Compression Tube \n\n\nYet another device examined in King’s book that bears strong conceptual parallels with the Bell is E. V. Gray’s “Scalar \nCompression Tube.” \n\n\nScalar Compression Tube \n\n\n\nE.V. Gray, U.S. Patent 4,601,747 \nU.S. Patent 4,595,975 \n\n\n(1987) \n\n(1986) \n\n\nThe conceptual resemblance to the Bell may be gleaned from a comparison of King’s comments with the diagram above: \n\nIn 1986 (and again in 1987) Gray patented a circuit and a tube. The tube is the critical element and it exhibits characteristics \nsimilar to hollow cathode switches and the tubes of Correa and Moray. The thin anode, down the central axis of the tube, \ncontains a spark gap. The anode is surrounded by a cylindrical, double grid cathode with the two grids electrically shorted \ntogether. The double grid behaves like a hollow cathode and contains glow plasma. This is the key component....The cold \ncurrent pulses originate from the glow plasma within this cathode.— \n\nThe principle of Gray’s “Scalar Compression Tube” then becomes evident in the following diagram: \n\nSymmetric Implosion Discharge \n\n\nGlow Plasma Shell \n\n\n\nKing states that the surrounding cylindrical double cathode grid \n\nSupports a radial, inward ion surge. This could manifest a “scalar compression” pulse where a positive polarization wave is \nsymmetrically directed inwardly to surround the anode. The phrase “scalar” means scalar potential, which results when opposite \nelectric field vectors cancel. Because of symmetry, the radial electric field vectors from the ions are in perfect opposition, which \ncreates a spiking, scalar potential transient when they surge inwardly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe similarities to Witkowski’s own reconstruction of the Bell’s operating principles is quite obvious, as is the conceptual similarity \nto Witkowski’s own drawing of the Bell, which has a small lead or cable coming from the top of the device, as if it were a very large \nversion of Gray’s tube. \n\n\n\n7. Counter-Rotating Electromagnetic Fields, ZPE Coherence, and Kontrabary \n\n\nThe physicist Wheeler thought that fluctuations in the zero point energy — or if one prefers the terminology, “oscillations in the \naether” — was the “foundation for all matter and energy in our universe.”— When this “fluctuation in the aether” is spin cohered — \nthat is, when a “vortex in the nothingness appears” — then it is detected in normal space as an elementary particle.— \n\nIn this respect, King offers his own summary on the engineering principles involved not only in cohering the Zero Point Energy, \nbut also in the crucial key area of stimulating a glow plasma, the necessary “ingredient” in the alchemy of aether physics: \n\na. Abrupt motion of glow plasma nuclei is needed; this glow plasma needs to be in the maximum possible state of charge \npolarization (spin coherence); \n\nb. The glow plasma needs to be appropriately shaped and symmetrically compressed; \n\nc. The glow plasma should be caught between bucking electromagnetic fields, that is to say, vector-zeroed fields; this is best \naccomplished by, \n\nd. Counter-rotation and “vortical forms.”— \n\nOf these elements, three in particular are crucial to the stimulation of the glow plasma. First there is the abrupt electrical pulse (which \none must assume is rapidly repeated, if the plasma is to be maintained in the necessary state', hence, one has another explanation of \nthe “beehive” buzzing sound Witkowski reports was associated with the Bell, since the sound is typical of rapidly opening and \nclosing DC switches). The second crucial element is the “bucking electromagnetic fields”, and the third is the counterrotating \nelectromagnetic fields, achieving symmetric compression through rotation.— \n\nIf one considers this list very carefully, it will be readily apparent that the Bell’s design and operation, as described by Witkowski, \ncontains all of these elements except that of abrupt and repeated pulsing. Even on Witkowski’s description and speculative \nreconstruction of its operation and design parameters, one is in the presence of an intentionally designed quantum coherence device. \nIf one adds in my own speculation of abmpt and repeated shocks to the vortices — delivered by rapid and repeated DC pulses— — \nthen the picture of the device and its operation is very nearly complete. \n\n\nC. The Vorticular Mechanics of the Aether: The Theories of O. C. Hilgenberg and Carl F. Krafft \n\n\nThere are three laws of any adequate theory of the mechanics of the aether, or of any genuine “hyper-dimensional” physics based \nupon it. These are: \n\n1. Rotation; \n\n2. Rotation; and, \n\n3. Rotation. \n\nPerhaps this humorous point is overstated, but nonetheless, if there is any single concept that has run as a consistent theme in the \nprevious chapters, from Witkowski’s reconstruction of the Bell in chapter four, to Bearden’s weaponized scalar physics and our \nsimple schematic explanation of the non-translational, internal stresses of “scalars” versus “vectors” in chapter five, it is rotation, or, \nif one prefer the more accurate term: vortex mechanics. \n\nBut is there any corroboration of any German wartime focus on such a physics, beyond the work and interests of the great Gerlach \nhimself? \n\nThere is indeed, and, as we shall see, this vortex model of nuclear physics is a fully developed theory , though not, certainly, the \nmainstream theory. And not surprisingly, the Germans are in the thick and center of it. Two scientists — names carefully expunged \nfrom physics textbooks along with that of Nikola Tesla — in particular are involved: O.C. Hilgenberg, and Carl Friedrich (or \nFrederick) Krafft. \n\nThe theory may be called “the vortex aether theory”. \n\nIn essence, a full theory of a vorticular aether was worked out by Dr. Hilgenberg before the war, complete with alternative \nexplanations of phenomena often adduced as support for relativity. Hilgenberg worked these ideas out in a series of booklets \npublished in Berlin: Uber Stromungsversuche mit Senken und Quellen, die das Wesen der Schwerkraft grundlegend erkldreni 1939, \n’’Essay Concerning Flux with Sinks and Sources, clarifying the fundamental substance of the Force of Gravity”), Uber Gravitation, \nTromben, und Wellen in bewegten Medien(1931, ’’Concerning Gravity, Pulses, and Waves in Moving Media”), Uber den Magnus- \nEffekt und seine Umkehrung(1933, ’’Concerning the Magnus Effect and its Reversal”). These were followed by a thorough \nexposition of the vortex aether model of atomic structure in an important post-war booklet called Quantenzahlen, Wirbelring- \nAtommodelle und Helium-Sechserring-Aufbauprinzip des Periodensystems der chemischen Elemente (1959, ”A Quantum Number \nVortex Atom Model and Helium-Hexagonal Construction Principle of the Periodic System of the Chemical Elements”).— \n\nHere we shall rely principally on the less technical presentation of Krafft, since in his book Ether and Matter Hilgenberg’s ideas \nare presented in their main substance.— \n\nIncluded in the vortex theory are some criticisms of relativity theory, as one might expect of a theory under development prior to \nand during the Nazi period. Like others, Krafft criticizes the dogmatic mathematical formalism of relativity by pointing out its \ntautological nature: \n\nRegardless of whether the velocity of light is actually constant, it is rendered constant in the Einsteinian equations by the use of \nvariable units of measurement. It is therefore not surprising that the equations of special relativity have met all the so-called \n“experimental tests”, because they are in substance nothing more than mathematical trueisms, and any violation of a \nmathematical trueism is unthinkable.— \n\nGerman physicist Hermann Fricke was even more unsparing of relativity’s mathematical formalism and the new dogmas it imposed \non physics: \n\nInstead of the ether we now have formulas and equations according to which some stars are millions of times more dense and \nothers millions of times less dense than the sun, although composed of the same chemical elements. We are now supposed to be \nable to ascertain (via mathematics) the diameter of the entire world, and also the number of protons and electrons in it. And \nfinally we are supposed to be able to calculate the exact time when the world (including space and time themselves) began with \nthe explosion of a point. As to all this, the 20 th century physicist may harangue as much as he pleases. All of this is accepted as \nwell-nigh certain. It is only the mechanics of the ether and the vortex atom theory which he may not write about or take up for \nserious study — that is anathema.— \n\nBut perhaps the dogmatism came from the fact that, “as O.C. Hilgenberg explained in detail in his recently published booklets,” the \noft-touted “proofs of relativity” — Doppler Red Shift, the progression of Mercury’s perihelion, and, of course, the failure of the \n\n\nMichelson-Morley experiment to detect the aether wind — “can be accounted for under the hydro-mechanical ether theory as well \nas, and even better than under Einsteinian relativity.”— \n\nPause and consider what this means. At least one scientist in Germany, Hilgenberg — and there were in fact many others — \nevolved a theory, based on a vortex model of the aether, that was not only a comprehensive explanation of gravity, that not only \ngave satisfactory explanations of “relativistic phenomena,” but, as we shall see, gave satisfactory accounts of atomic structure as \nwell, and in some cases did so more satisfactorily than the “nuclear” theory. This, basically, was the theoretical milieu in which \nphysicists in Nazi Germany worked, a peculiar blend of the avante garde notions of quantum mechanics and vortices, with the older \nidea of an underlying substrate common to mind, energy, and matter: the aether.— \n\nAs Krafft points out, one of Hilgenberg’s trenchant criticisms was of relativistic interpretations of the Red Shift effect. Positing an \naether, Hilgenberg stated a law, in 1931, in opposition to Einstein’s emerging “expanding universe” theories that were beginning to \nemerge,— which Krafft summarizes as follows: \n\nThe following is therefore universally true for all media: Whenever a train of waves traverses a medium that has currents \nflowing across it, an observer who is at rest relative to the source of radiation will observe a diminution of frequency, and a \nsimultaneous refraction of the ray in a direction opposite to the direction of the current it traverses.— \n\nThe assumption of a vorticular structure in the aether as constituting the basis of observable particles and energy also bridges \nconveniently to the idea of a flux in the vacuum, or zero point energy, for “if the elementary or subatomic particles are vortices in the \nether, then it would be reasonable to assume that such vortices keep the ether in a turbulent and streaming condition.”— \n\nAs Krafft points out, the vortex model also has another powerful explanatory function in accounting for the persistence of the \nindividuality of any given particle. \n\nThe most outstanding characteristic of all elementary particles of matter is their localized persistence of individuality, and it is \ninconceivable how this can be explained on any other basis than vortex motion, wave motion, or motion into or out of a center \nfunctioning as a sink or source. \n\nIf the ether is incompressible, then it can have only two forms of motion which are dynamically self-sustaining, namely \nvortex motion and wave motion. The stability of these two forms of motion is not due to any unique property of the medium, \nbut is inherent in the form of motion itself.— \n\nMoreover, the model assumes another important feature, one pregnant with implications not only for “scalar physics” and the Bell, \nbut also for any true appreciation of the work of Nikola Tesla: \n\nA vortex atom for example may be assumed to carry an array of standing waves along with it in the form of nodes and loops \nin the streamlines of the circulating ether, as is evidenced by electron diffraction patterns, but this is something very different \nfrom the usual concept of “wave atom.”— \n\nAgain, consider what this means: a basic theory had been worked out connecting vorticular structures in the aether, not only with \nelementary particles and vacuum flux, but that flux is now connected to structures of standing waves in the medium itself, structures \nwhich give rise to “nodes and loops” in the medium, making it resemble a crystal lattice. \n\nKrafft uses the following diagrams to illustrate the basic vorticular structure of electrons and protons. \n\nKrafft’s vortex Model of a Neutron(Left) and Hydrogen Atom (Right) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA further consequence results from this conception, one with obvious implications for the Bell: \n\nThe mass of proton must have its origin in the gyrostatic effect of the circulating or rotating ether , either inside or outside the \nvortex rings. The greater mass of the proton as compared with the electron may then be attributed either to a greater speed of \ncirculatory movement of the ether, or to a greater volume of circulating ether, or to the difference in geometric structures.— \n\nAltering, or cohering the rotation of a particle or aggregate of particles will thus in turn affect the circulation of the ether and \nconsequently affect the mass of that aggregate. \n\nKrafft then makes a stunning series of statements whose similarities to the Bell and the type of physics it implies are obvious: \n\nIf one proton and one electron produces the system of ether current shown in the diagram of the hydrogen atom (above), then \nmany protons and many electrons should produce a similar system of ether currents, but on a larger scale. In order to test for the \npresence of such ether currents, the arrangement of apparatus shown (below) may be used. An interferometer of approximately \nsquare form has hollow metal spheres or cylinders placed over two of the comers. These spheres or cylinders are then charged \nelectrostatically as shown so that there will be an electrostatic potential gradient along one of the bifurcated beams. If there is a \nflow of ether along electrostatic lines of force as indicated by the short straight arrows, then there should be a shift of the \ninterference fringes when the electrostatic field is applied, provided the ether flows with sufficient velocity to produce an \nobservable effect.— \n\nFrom there it is a short step to the idea that the two cylinders could be counter-rotated both mechanically and electrically, producing \nvector cancellation and a “rotational bubble” of localized space around the Bell, to study any mass anomalies. \n\nKrafft’s Interferometer \n\n\n\nI \n\n\nIn any case, Hilgenberg, by the time of his “Quantenzahlen” paper, was able to re-model almost the entire periodic table, \nincluding the properties of the super-heavy elements not even discovered. \n\n\nHilgenberg’s Neon Model (Number 10, Mass 22) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHilgenberg’s Krypton Model (Number 26, Mass 82) \n\n\n\nHilgenberg’s Xenon Model (Number 54, Mass 132) \n\n\n\nHilgenberg’s Model of Element 118, Mass 336 \n\n\n\nWhat emerges from this? \n\nBasically, that during the crucial years leading up to and during World War Two, the Nazi Reich possessed the outlines of a \ntheory - some of which had been worked out prior to the Nazi assumption of power - of matter, of gravitation, of the atomic and sub¬ \natomic structure of matter, and of the fluctuations of the vacuum or zero point energy. Moreover, this theory was based on a very \ndifferent and very simple conceptual foundation from relativity. And notably, one significant prediction of this theory is that local \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurvature of space is engineerable and that mass displacement effects are achievable by counter-rotation of plasma. In short, the \ntheory is in radical disagreement with relativity which predicts space curvature only in the presence of very large masses. \n\nAdditionally, if we assume that the Bell was a pulsed device, then it is reasonable to assume that in the process the Nazis, in their \nexperiments on the Bell, discovered quite deadly field effects resembling the Mossbauer Effect, effects that betoken the scalar \nphysics of Tom Bearden. \n\n\n\nD. Back to Mercury Vortex Engines \n\n\nBut there is one last clue that must be examined. \n\nIt will be recalled that Witkowski mentioned the mysterious “Xerum 525,” and that it was his opinion that this was a radioactive \nisotope of mercury, in compound with other elements: \n\nBefore each trial some kind of ceramic, oblong container was placed in the core (it was defined as a “vacuum flask”...), \nsurrounded by a layer of lead approx. 3 cm thick. It was approx. 1-1.5 m long and filled with a strange, metallic substance, with \na violet-gold hue and preserving at room temperature the consistency of “slightly coagulated jelly ”. From the produced \ninformation it followed that this substance was codenamed “IRR XERUM-525” or ”IRR SERUM-525” and contained among \nother constituents the thorium oxide and beryllium oxide (beryllia).— \n\nAnd, as was seen, Witkowski also ends his survey of the Bell with the comment that the Nazis might have been guided in their \nresearch from a most unusual source: \n\n(Yet) one more issue remains — how did it happen that scientists from the 1940s understood exactly where they were heading? \nThey had applied after all ideas from XXI century physics. How is it, that they were conscious of bringing about a major \nturning-point? What arguments did they lay down (before the launch of work) that caused them to win the race for funds with \nthe great nand influential armaments consortiums? And they won decisively. \n\nIt seems that the whole issue is something more than just a technical problem. The unusualness of all this is summed up by \nthe fact, that descriptions of mercuric propulsion had appeared as long ago as in ancient times - in alchemy and old Hindu \nbooks - one can easily check this. The “Samaranganasutradhara” a book at least 2,000 years old, said for example: “By means \nof the power latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside may travel a great distance \nin the sky in a most marvelous manner. \n\nBut there is more to it than that. \n\n“Xerum 525” possessed some odd properties, not the least of which was its ’’violet gold hue.” An ancient Sanskrit text on the \nancient vimana aircraft of India contains the following interesting sentence: “On the north side liquefied mixture of loadstone, mica, \nand serpent slough should he placed. And crystals should be placed at the requisite centers. Whatever “serpent slough” might \nbe, clearly there is more involved in the ancient “mercury vortex engines” than simply ordinary mercury. It is mercury in compound \nwith other elements, for a little way on, the same text indicates that this is a very odd liquid indeed: “Shaktipaniaraka mani should be \nplaced in the mixture of magnet, mercury, mica, and serpent-slough. ” This suggests that the “violet-gold hue” of Xerum 525 might \nbe the result of the mixture of mercury with quasi-crystalline or crystalline elements, suspended in microscopic flecks in the fluid. \nThe similarity of “Xerum 525” to this ancient Sanskrit text describing precisely an unusual form of propulsion achieved through the \nuse of mercury certainly suggests, that at some very high and hidden level, someone in the Nazi Reich was reading ancient texts with \na very practiced physicist’s eye. In any case, this additional fact makes Witkowski’s suggestion of an esoteric foundation to the Bell \nmore credible. \n\nBut there is one final thing to consider. \n\nThe late Bill Clendenon, well-known UFOlogist and “mercury vortex engine” proponent, similarly stumbled on the ancient \nSanskrit vimana texts, and drew similar conclusions. At the time, some scoffed at Clendenon’s ideas, and of course, at the time he \nwrote his book, Mercury: UFO Messenger of the Gods, the story of the Bell had not yet become public in the upheaval of post¬ \nreunification Germany. \n\nAnd these facts make Clendenon’s quotations and analyses (the italicized portions in the following quotation) of the vimana texts \nall the more amazing: \n\nThe Sanskrit Samarangana Sureadhara says, “Inside one must place the mercury engine with its iron heating apparatus \nbeneath.” Inside the circular airframe, place the mercury engine with its electric/ultrasonic boiler at the bottom center. \n\n“By means of the power latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind— in motion, a man sitting inside may travel \nto a great distance in the sky in a most marvelous manner.” - The unchained heat energy from the hot mercury vapor sets the \nair pump/turbine in motion. \n\n“Four strong mercury containers must be built into the interior structure. When these have been heated by controlled fire from \niron containers, the Vimana develops thunder-power through the mercury. And at once it becomes like a pearl in the sky.” - \n\n\nOne mercury boiler and three mercury flux valve sensor units must be installed in the propulsion system within the center of the \ncircular air frame. When these mercury containers have been heated by electrically controlled fire (hot mercury vapor) from \nthe containers, the aircraft develops ultrasonic power through the mercury. And, at once, the ionized recirculating airflow \nbecomes like a pearl in the sky.— \n\nIf Bill Clendenon can figure this much out, then it takes little imagination to see how a Walther Gerlach, himself a specialist in \ngravity, spin polarization, and mercury plasmas, might interpret such a text. Indeed, if one compares Witkowski’s descriptions of the \nBell to these ancient texts - without the intermediary of Clendenon’s own speculations - then the resemblance becomes even more \npalpable. \n\nAnd if all this sounds incredible, one should recall the article that appeared in the January 3, 1969 issue of Science, where \nscientists Schubert, Gerald and Whitehead “reported that when a heat source was rotated slowly below a dish of mercury, the \nmercury began to revolve in the contrary direction and then gathered speed until it was circulating faster than the flame.”— \n\nIt would seem, then, that the Bell, whatever else it may be from a purely scientific standpoint, is, from the standpoint of esoteric \nhistory, a deliberate attempt to reconstruct an ancient and lost technology, a technology far in advance of that of the 1930s and \n1940s. \n\n\nE. Speculations: the Bell as a Scalar Physics Device \n\n\nSo, gathering together all the alternative notions of the previous chapters, what do we have? \n\nOne may perhaps speculate along the following lines: \n\n1. The basic structure of all elementary particles is that they are vorticular structures in the aether; \n\n2. Mass and “particle” or “system” individuality arise and are preserved by means of this vorticular motion; \n\n3. Since a vortex which is stable in the plane of the medium (i.e., not drifting in any direction) nevertheless still rotates around \nan axis, any particular vortex, of any size in any system context, may be said to possess a scalar signature. In effect, the \n“scalar signature” of any system is ultimately vorticular in structure and nature;— \n\n4. Thus, the local spacetime “medium” or aether is engineerable and, contrary to relativity, it is not necessary to be in the \npresence of large masses to bend or otherwise shape or stress space and the objects in it;— \n\n5. Coherence of atomic spin should thus produce not only mass displacement effects that could be utilized for propulsion, but \nother phenomena that could be weaponized, since vorticular structures can produce standing waves in the medium; \n\n6. This cohering action might be further stimulated by the use of radioactive isotopes subjected to sudden repeated pulses or \nstresses of an “electro-acoustic” nature, as in the Mossbauer Effect, or a continuous stress by counter-rotation to vector-zero \nelectromagnetic vectors, or some combination of both. I believe that the Bell involved a pulsed aspect of some nature such as \nthis, given Witkowski’s testimony of its characteristic sound; \n\n7. Since atoms are aggregates of vortices, it is similarly possible to conceive of transmuting one element into another by \nreconfiguring its scalar signature - i.e., its “aetheric” longitudinal wave structure. Since vortices are accompanied by such \nstructures, an alteration in the one would seem to imply an alteration in the other, and therefore, in the very structure of matter \nitself. Altering that wave structure could conceivably transmute any matter impacted by it, accounting for “low energy \ntransmutation” phenomena. \n\nWhile the Bell demonstrably fulfills, in so many different ways, the paradigms of the alternative physics examined in this and in the \nprevious chapters, there can be no doubt that the Germans working on it, led by Gerlach, whose brilliant student Hilgenberg outlined \nthe emerging vortex theory, were interested not only in the propulsive uses of their new physics and technology, but also in its \nbenign and malign uses as energy suppliers, and ultimately, weapons of horrendous power. It was a prototype “scalar” device for a \nnew and “unified physics,” and it cannot be doubted for a moment that the Nazis new the full potential - both for massively creative \ngood and for massively destructive evil - of what they held in their hands. The fact that the Bell and its master - Kammler - \ndisappeared entirely after the war, the fact that Gerlach’s diaries - which doubtless contained much information on the subject - \nremain classified to this day, the fact that it and it alone, beyond even the Third Reich’s fuel air bombs, Sarin gas, and atom bombs, \nwas classified “decisive for the war” (Kriegsentscheidend) is testimony enough that they were “working in areas of physics that were \nmonstrous, on a daily basis.” \n\n\n7 \n\n\n„Berlach’s Dem Alchemp:“ The Mysterious; Serum 525 \n\n\n“Although the principal compound is almost completely undocumented, the metallic elements involved (in red mercury) loom \nlarge in the history of alchemy and the descriptions of it bear an uncanny resemblance to those of the Philosopher’s Stone, \nright down to its being a form of ‘fixed’, i.e., thermally stable, mercury which can then be ‘projected upon’, i.e., amalgamated \nwith, liquid mercury. ” \n\nS.M.S hires— \n\n\nA. An Article in the Evening Newspaper \n\n\nOn Friday, July 18, 1924, Nobel laureate physicist, Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, published an interesting article in the evening \nedition of the Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper entitled “The Transmutation of Mercury into Gold” (see picture page 274). The article, \nthough brief, opens a Pandora’s box of possibilities and speculations dark with abysmal promise. The editorial introduction begins \ninnocently enough: \n\nTo yesterday’s telegraphically transmitted note on “Modem Alchemy”, we present the following report as a welcome \nsupplement and commentary. \n\nAnd with that short notice, Gerlach’s main text follows in all its significant concision: \n\nIn no. 29 of the weekly magazine “Physical Science,” Prof. A. Miethe from the Technical Higher School in Charlottenburg \ntogether with Dr. Staumreich apprises us (of the fact) that it might be possible to induce the disintegration of mercury with \nrelatively simple physical methods and to clearly identify gold as one of the chemical and physical products of the \ndisintegration. Until now we have known of two types of atomic bonding: spontaneous decay that occurs through no sort of \nexternal influence, and that through such external radioactive disintegration process such as was first carried out by the English \nphysicist Rutherford, and as was shortly thereafter repeated in the Vienna Radium Institute by disintegrating lighter atoms (for \nexample, lithium, boron, silicon, aluminum and so on) through bombardment with “rays”. The general possibility of an \n“alchemy” is no longer in need of proof, since atomic research has demonstrated that all atoms are constructed from very simple \nbuilding blocks, from hydrogen and helium, the lightest things...; various chemical elements may hereafter be distinguished by \nthe number of components and perhaps through the types of atoms they (most readily) bind to. \n\nThe point of origin ofMiethe’s (investigation) was the observation that mercury lamps ... by means of very powerful and fast \nbombardment formed a dark incrustation on their interior winding. The research obtained greater amounts of such \nincrustation in the mercury lamps - it was made certain that such mercury lamps were free of any gold material, in the course \nof 70 - 200 hours with 70 volts potential and loaded with 400-2000 watts - yielding a measurable quantity of gold!....The \namounts are small, but they are always between 1/10 and 1/100 milligrams, but tangibly weighable and analyzable....A larger \nscientific exploration is to be hoped for, because there is every indication these authors have made a singular and \nthoroughgoing breakthrough, especially when one considers the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed.— \n\nOn first reading, the article appears like so many other popular science articles of that era when nuclear physics was on the verge of \nthe discovery of fission (by Otto Hahn fourteen years later in 1938): full of promise, yet naively unaware of the complexities of \nquantum mechanics that lurked just around the comer. A modem day physicist would most likely dismiss it as the type of “wishful \nthinking” that so often accompanies scientific discovery, before the “reality” of subsequent observation sets in. \n\nBut there are problems with that viewpoint too, not the least of which is that the article is by Gerlach, and that it does occur before \nthe discovery of nuclear fission. Simply put, the transmutation being observed by professors Miethe and Straumreich appears to be \ninduced precisely by “electrolytical” methods, since the “bombardment” being referred to is expressed in conventional terms of \n“volts” and “watts.” Yet, the context also indicates that radioactive bombardment - most likely by electrically generated x- rays - is \nalso in mind. \n\n\nGerlach’s 1924 Frankfurter Zeitung Newspaper Article on the Transmutation of Mercury into Gold \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n$«K<ni. «•- lun ««*• \n\n\n3 r ranli ftirler 3 eihimi \n\n---- - - mi* '- / — \n\n\n— |TI* <Prrh»nnbfun<5 t&n C.urcfprtrr In Sorb.] 3u bcr \nMfttrn uni Ul<grapbif$ augBrtfdn fibctmltlcUtn Rotij ,®l gbitM \nVldbtmle* brlngtn lolt a‘.;(,s-- lf?mmcn* Grglnjiiiig Me f#tg«*- \nW« ladjfunblgm Hu8fiibnino r »K«D B 9lt. 29 b« BoAtnf4>rl(t .tl« \nfishitmlfttn (fallen* tctlt tt XDt « t ( t *Mi 0« tt<tnl|djrn \n\n£e«bl4ut( In GbotroKtnbutir'mlt bob «• fbm gmelnfam mil \nw Gtemmrcl^ gclunarn (cl. bat >3nfolI bet CluctfTUbtt* nut \n\nK lntin cln(ocf<r ptjnftfalifArn CUtttln feneUnffllrat unb aU tine# \nt 3*d«Sptobun« baf ® o t b (bdmlfdb unb pb8(ltatlf4 einbeutm \n|u lbtnll|lglttfn Bi8b« ftnnt man gmet Wrttn pen Wtomocrwonb \nlunntn: bit.f«onton ncttouMlxn-iUnb butch fclncrfd Aufitrc Gin. \nilifungcn brtlnflufeboTcn rabrorfUbcn Scrfaniptoi'fTeHinb blc \n\n\n. . _ ____ ...

Miethe. Readers familiar with the Nazi Legend of the UFO will recognize the name of Miethe as being one of those \nallegedly involved with Schriever, Habermol, Epp, Schauberger, and Bellonzo in flying saucer research for the Nazis. Could this be \nthe same Miethe, or even a relation? \n\nAnd finally, does Gerlach’s call for “a larger effort” to investigate the phenomenon represent the factual basis behind Jan Van \nHelsing’s allegations that actual work in radical field propulsion craft began in the secret societies that swarmed in 1920s Germany \nlong before the Nazis came to power? \n\nWhatever the answer to these questions may turn out to be, one thing is clear from Gerlach’s article, and that is that he is not \nthinking in terms of the standard models of transmutation via neutron bombardment that would obtain after the discovery of nuclear \nfission simply because those models do not yet exist, yet, he is thinking in terms of some form of transmutation via radioactive and \nelectromagnetic bombardment, or rather, stress. Indeed, for Gerlach, whose 1921 experiment in magnetic resonance and electron \nspin won him the Nobel prize in physics, these results must have set his own mind buzzing with the possibilities of what spin and \nresonance, under extreme conditions, might be able to achieve, given enough funding, interest, and research. This, I believe, is what \nmust have actually been in his mind. \n\nThese insights make his final two comments darkly revealing. “A larger scientific exploration is to be hoped for,” Gerlach urges, \n“because there is every indication these authors have made a singular and thoroughgoing breakthrough, especially when one \nconsiders the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed.” It is the familiar cry of a scientist making a plea for research \nfunding. And given his notoriety and that of the newspaper in which he presents his plea, there can be only one intended target of his \nremarks: the German government and its many corporate financial backers. \n\nBut notice the final remark concerning “the astonishingly low stability of mercury when it is stressed. ” Gerlach here enunciates in \n\n\n\na few words the line of investigation he wishes such research to take: subject a high density, viscuous low stability metal such as \nmercury to stress. And given the context, we know what kind of stress he intends to subject it to: radioactive and electrical. Gerlach \nhas deduced the obvious: if such simple means can cause minute amounts of mercury to transmute into gold, then this must mean \nthat these conditions induce a kind of instability in mercury. And with that, a whole new world of possibilities opened up before him, \na world he himself calls “alchemical.” \n\nViewed in the context of the previous chapters, an intriguing and highly suggestive constellation of relationships now emerges. At \nthe end of the story, we have Gerlach \n\n1. heading up the most secret weapons project in Nazi Germany (the Bell); \n\n2. this project by all accounts involved the use of extremely high voltage, given that the device itself had ports for high voltage \nelectrical cabling, given that the Henge pool also had similar ports, and given that Dr. Kurt Debus, an expert in high voltage, \nwas a member of the Bell’s scientific research team; \n\n3. this project apparently utilized some dense and liquid material, the mysterious “Xerum 525”, that may very likely have been \nsome isotope of mercury, as plausibly argued by Witkowski; \n\n4. this liquid was housed in lead lined bottles inside the Bell, which gave off strong radiations, indicating that the serum or \nliquid may have been mercury highly doped with radioactive materials; \n\n5. the liquid was rotated at extremely high speeds of mechanical (and possibly electrical) nature; \n\n6. and then was possibly subjected to sudden high voltage direct current pulses, as I Have argued. \n\nAll this is to say that Gerlach headed a project at the end of World War Two that apparently involved some liquid of similar \ncharacteristics to mercury which was then stressed, just as his article urged. \n\nBut at the beginning of the story, we have Gerlach writing an article outlining very similar possibilities for a popular German \nnewspaper, and making a subtle though clear plea for a large scale scientific effort to investigate precisely radioactive and electrical \nstressing of mercury. \n\nConsequently, it appears that someone, somewhere inside Weimar Germany read Gerlach’s article, and decided to back his \nproject. The Bell, therefore, may have been a project that by 1945 had possibly already been underway for twenty-one years! In \nother words, “the Bell” represents the culmination of a project begun nine years before the Third Reich even existed. \n\nMore importantly, Gerlach’s remarks also oddly corroborate the mysterious exchange of the scientists interred at Farm Hall who \nspeak of a “photochemical” process of isotope enrichment unknown to the Allies, a process evocative of “cold fusion,”— for here in \n1924 Gerlach is thinking in precisely such terms: transmutation of a low stability element by subjecting it to high stress of an \nelectrical and radioactive nature. And lest it be forgotten, of all the scientists interred at Farm Hall, it was Gerlach alone who was \nsingled out for the dubious honor of further interrogation by American authorities long after his Farm Hall colleagues had been \nreleased and returned to occupied Germany. It was Gerlach alone, of all the scientists interred at Farm Hall, who appeared to be off \nin his own world of “magnetic fields separation” and “the gravity of local space,” remarks which, I am sure, must have raised not \nonly the eyebrows of his British captors but also his fellow scientists. \n\nBut is there anything in the literature that indicates such a “radioactively doped” form of mercury might possess some peculiar \nphysical properties? As I wrote in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, The Reich of the Black Sun, there would indeed \nappear to be just such a substance: \n\nBut what was the mysterious “Xerum 525”? When I first read of this strange material, I thought it might be some radioactive \nisotope of mercury, or possibly a more radioactive substance in chemical solution of some sort. It is perhaps worth noting that \nrecently a strange substance known as “red mercury”, or mercury antimonite oxide, has been alleged to have strong neutron \nemitting properties when subjected to sudden explosive stress, and is alleged to be a non-fissile method of triggering the \nenormous fusion reactions of hydrogen bombs, as well as being capable, in its own right, of ....explosions in the small kiloton \nrange. Perhaps the Nazis had stumbled onto a similar such substance during the war.— \n\nBut just what exactly is red mercury? Is it a powerful new type of conventional explosive, capable of triggering fusion reactions in \ndeuterium and tritium without the need for an atomic bomb as the fuse, as some allege, making a “pure fusion” bomb a nightmarish \npossibility? Or is it, as others maintain, a fanciful post-Cold War hoax? \n\n\nB. Mercury Pyro-Antimonate, or Red Mercury (Mercury Antimony Oxide) \n\n\n\n1. Code-name DOVE \n\n\nRed mercury, or mercury antimony oxide - chemical symbol Hg 2 Sb 2 0 7 - enjoyed a short, if notorious, career as the nuclear threat \nof the nineteen nineties. The story broke more or less simultaneously in various parts of the world, as the mysterious substance \nappeared to be behind a series of murders in the black market arms trade in post-apartheid South Africa, blocked smuggling attempts \nin the then recently-reunified Germany, and according to some stories, was even being sought by such “nations of concern” as Libya \nand Iraq as a basis for their own nuclear weapons programs. Then, almost as soon as the mysterious compound appeared, \ndenunciations of the whole substance and subject as a “hoax” were issued by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and \nvarious other national and international nuclear regulatory agencies. \n\nBut one physicist who did not dismiss the story as a pure hoax was the American inventor of the neutron bomb, Dr. Sam Cohen. \nFor Cohen, the possibility of “pure fusion” bombs - that is, hydrogen bombs that do not require an atom bomb as their trigger— - \nwas brought home to him while he was on a visit to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories during a visit he made there in the spring \nof 1958.— During this visit, Cohen was briefed on a pure fusion bomb project. \n\nThis device, code-named DOVE, fascinated me. It contained no fissile material; rather, its explosive power derived from heavy \nhydrogen - deuterium and tritium. Because of its extremely low nuclear cost and its high yield - comparable to that of a very \nlarge conventional bomb - it would in a military application, represent a revolutionary new class of weapons. A device of this \nnature, having a yield the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT, could kill enemy troops out to hundreds of yards, with no significant \nurban destruction and contamination.— \n\nThe interest such a device held for the American military was more than just theoretical, for such devices would cost “roughly one- \nhundredth that of a battlefield fission weapon, meaning that these things could be turned out by the hundreds.”— \n\nThe theory behind such a device was simple. \n\nThe most promising approach was to use a large spherical high-explosive charge to concentrate the explosive energy in a very \nsmall capsule containing deuterium and tritium. In theory, this would cause the desired thermonuclear reaction. The program \nproceeded for some years and finally was terminated for lack of progress. Later, the Los Alamos laboratory had a go at it. But \nto my disappointment, and theirs, the problem remained intractable. The program ultimately was ended.— \n\nThat is, theoretically, it should be possible to take the implosion detonator for a conventional atomic bomb, and instead of using it to \ncompress a critical mass of plutonium to initiate fission, one could replace the plutonium with deuterium or tritium, compressing it \nsufficiently to increase the energy and density, and hence the statistical probability of collision (fusion) of heavy hydrogen atoms, \nand voila! One would have a “small” hydrogen bomb without the need of an atom bomb to detonate it. \n\nBut the effort failed, and it should be obvious why: no conventional explosive possessed sufficient brisance— to compress the \nheavy hydrogen to pressures sufficient to initiate fusion reactions. This affords a clue to what Dr. Cohen is not telling in his article: \nthe United States was searching for a conventional explosive of sufficient bursting power that, when used in an implosion detonator, \nwould compress heavy hydrogen to fusion energies and pressures. If such could be found, the atom bomb would become as extinct \nas the dodo bird, for two obvious reasons. First, if such a conventional explosive could be found, then it could be used as a powerful \nexplosive in its own right, replacing the need for small yield strategic and tactical fission weapons, since it would be far smaller than \na fuel air bomb of similar yield, and far less costly than its fission counterparts. Secondly, if such an explosive could be found, then, \nas Cohen intimates, it could be used as the detonator for a very small, “clean,” neutron-emitting hydrogen bomb, or, as Cohen does \nnot intimate, as the detonator for the city-and-county-cracking blockbuster strategic hydrogen bomb. In either case, the cost would be \nfar less than a conventional thermonuclear bomb. \n\nHowever, as Cohen relates, there the story ended, until the crack-up of the Soviet Union and the new Russian Republic’s \nwillingness to be more open about its nuclear weapons research. \n\nSeveral years before Livermore began DOVE, the Soviets had started their own “pure-fusion” development. Unlike the U.S. \nthey were quite open about it, claiming it was directed solely for peaceful applications. In 1957, Soviet nuclear-weapon \ndesigner I.A. Artsimovich presented a paper in Geneva describing experiments done in 1952, based on the same high-explosive \nimplosion technology used in DOVE. He claimed progress had been made. Shortly thereafter, however, Soviet researchers \nstopped all public mention of the project. \n\nOn the other hand, the Soviet military had no hesitation in writing about such devices in their open military literature. In \n\n\n1961, Colonel M. Pavlov, writing in Red Star, discussed almost precisely what I had briefed Paul Nitze on. Pavlov’s \ncalculations of weapon effectiveness were almost identical to mine, which were classified. This indicated to me that although \nthe Soviets were not talking about research on DOVE, they were doing it.— \n\nThen, in 1992, a Russian nuclear weapons expert revealed details about what the Russians called “third generation nuclear \nweapons,” weapons that could “double the yield” with a “hundredfold reduction of weight compared to existing weapons.”— \nCohen cites another Russian authority on the subject as stating “You can drop a couple of hundred little bombs on foreign territory, \nthe enemy is devastated, but for the aggressor there are no consequences,”— for with such weapons there is none of the deadly, \nlong lasting radioactive cloud to drift back over the user’s own country in a lethal radioactive fallout. Again, one is reminded of the \nNazi’s use of fuel-air bombs in their rocket batteries on the eastern front, only in this case, it really is a combination of the phrases \n“tactical nukes” and “carpet bombing.” \n\nAs Cohen explains, the “doubling of yield” with a “hundred fold reduction in weight” clearly indicates that the Russians were not \ntalking about standard battlefield tactical nuclear weapons, since even the most pure plutonium still had to be at least a few hundreds \nof grams simply to have enough material to generate spontaneous fission. Below a certain threshold of weight, fission was \nimpossible, and a one hundredfold reduction would make a fission weapon inconceivable. The Russians therefore had to have been \ntalking about a pure fusion weapon, about “some version of DOVE, based on a detonation technology that doesn’t exist in the \nUnited States. In other words, there were only two options for interpreting the Russians’ remarks: either they were lying, or they \nhad discovered the holy grail of thermonuclear bomb engineering, a conventional explosive with enough brisance to compress heavy \nhydrogen to fusion pressures and energies. \n\nAnd with this Cohen comments, albeit only briefly, on a whole new type of conventional explosive, of which red mercury is but \none substance: \n\nIn recent years unclassified research has been conducted on a new class of materials (including red mercury), referred to as \nballotechnics. These materials use a number of elements in low density powder form. When they are subjected to high-pressure \nshock compression, chemical reactions take place which under certain conditions can produce energy concentrations \nconsiderably in excess of those from high explosives. Ballotechnics therefore offer a significantly greater prospect for success in \nattaining a very low yield pure-fusion weapon than the high-explosive techniques we and other nations have explored.— \n\nCohen also notes that red mercury was allegedly developed in the former Soviet Union precisely as a detonator for nuclear \nwarheads. Indeed, its efficiency as a detonator was so great that a bomb the size of a hand grenade would be sufficient to blow a \nlarge ship out of the ocean.— After taking note of the fact that the CIA and various other American agencies dismissed the “red \nmercury” story as a hoax which they nevertheless were taking seriously - “whatever that means,” Cohen quips— - he then says \nnothing more about it. \n\n\n2. The .01 Kiloton Yield Pure Fusion Bomb: The Logic of Fusion Weapons Development \n\n\nBut what has all this to do with red mercury and the Bell? The answer is a complex one, and to see why, one should place Dr. \nCohen’s remarks in the context of a general history of nuclear weapons developments. The pure fusion device represents the last in \nthe various generations of nuclear weapons. One may summarize these various generations as follows: \n\na. First Generation Weapons: \n\nThis generation of weapon comes in three distinct phases, ascending from the least to the more complex: \n\n1. Radiological Weapons (“Dirty Bombs ”): this is the simplest type of nuclear weapon, where a conventional explosive \nis used to disperse a cloud of deadly radioactive fallout over a wide area. The explosion is purely conventional, \nalthough it requires rudimentary nuclear technology to produce the required radioactive isotopes in sufficient quantity \nfor such a weapon. This is the type of weapon many erroneously allege was the only nuclear weapon ever actually \nachieved by the Third Reich; \n\n2. “The Semi-Fission” or “Atomic Fizzle” Bomb: This type of device actually does generate some nuclear combustion \nof the nuclear fuel, creating an enormous explosion, though falling short of a full fission reaction. It is a cross between \nthe “dirty” bomb” above and the full fission device below. The explosion, since it does not combust the nuclear \nmaterial nearly as completely, is also a very dirty bomb. Its yield would be in the fractions of a kiloton, still enormous \nby conventional standards, but still far short of an actual atom bomb. The atomic “fizzling firecracker” effect of such \na bomb looks and has the shock wave of a typical explosion, but it is nonetheless a “fizzle.” \n\n3. The Pure Fission, or Atomic Bomb: This type of device is the first genuinely nuclear bomb, where a critical mass of \nuranium 235 or plutonium 239 is assembled quickly enough to emit fast neutrons, which then split the atoms of the \ncritical mass in a geometrical growth of fissioning atoms, producing the colossal explosion of an atomic bomb. The \ncrictical mass is typically assembled by an implosion detonator of explosives surrounding a sphere of plutonium, \nwhich is crushed to supercritical density. Nonetheless, some of the critical mass remains unconsumed in the explosion \nno matter how efficient it is, and deadly radioactive fallout is always a by-product of such weapons. These are the \ntypes of weapons America first dropped on Japan. Note that to achieve this final stage a basic reactor technology, \nwhile not needed, is desirable, since plutonium, the most efficient fuel for such a device, can only be synthesized in a \nfully functional reactor. This will become an important point as we proceed. \n\nb. Second Generation Weapons: \n\nThe next generation of weapons comes in three distinct chronological phases: \n\n1. Boosted Fission Weapons: As nuclear technology develops and becomes more proficient as isotope separation and \nenrichment, purer grade of fissile weapons grade material is produced, allowing more efficient combustion of the \ncritical mass in the explosion, and a commensurate drop in deadly radioactive fallout. Additionally, some neutron \nemitting material such as deuterium or tritium is “salted” into the critical mass, to create an additional burst of high \nenergy neutrons which increase the amount of neutrons in the chain reaction, increasing the yield of the bomb, \nmaking smaller bombs of higher yield possible. This is the first step towards miniaturizing an atom bomb, as well as \nthe first step toward a fully fledged hydrogen bomb. Atomic bombs of this sort can also be very large, having yields \nin the several tens of kilotons. It is this type of weapon that some allege was tested by Nazi Germany in March of \n1945 at the Ohrdruf troop parade ground in Thuringia.— \n\n2. Fission-Fusion (-Fission) or Full Hvdrogen Bombs: The next step from boosted fission is to make the heavy \nhydrogen component of the bomb the main explosive punch of the weapon by packing the bomb with enough \nfusionable material that, when the atom bomb is detonated, the enormous pressures and temperatures created \ncompress this material to such a degree its atoms collide and combine, or “fuse ” (rather than split or fission), \nreleasing truly stupendous amounts of energy and free neutrons. The yield of the first exemplars of such weapons \nwere in the tens of megatons (one million tons of TNT equals a megaton, whereas an atom bomb is measured merely \nin kilotons, or one thousand tons of TNT). While the fusion reaction produces enormous radiation, this is in the form \nof gamma and x-rays and free neutrons, which, while deadly, dissipate rather quickly after the explosion when \ncompared to the radiation caused by the atom bomb used to detonate it, which lingers for years. Theoretically, there is \nno limit to the size of a hydrogen bomb.— This type of bomb may have a second atom bomb added to increase the \nyield and radioactive fallout. It implies the existence of a highly developed nuclear technology both to miniaturize the \n\n\natom bomb, and to create sufficient amounts of fusionable material - the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and \ntritium - for a thermonuclear explosion. \n\n3. The Neutron Bomb: In this type of bomb the atom bomb detonator is made as small and efficient as possible, as is the \nheavy hydrogen component. The goal is to make the atomic explosion and radioactivity from the fission reaction as \nsmall as possible, while making the radioactivity from the neutrons of the heavy hydrogen as large as possible. The \nblast damage from such a weapon is thus comparatively small, while its radioactive effects are quite large. The aim is \nto minimize physical damage to buildings, while killing enemy troops. In effect, the neutron bomb is the opposite of \nthe boosted fission bomb. In the latter, the heavy hydrogen is used to “boost” the yield of the atomic explosion itself, \nbut in the neutron bomb, the atomic explosion is used to “boost” the neutron yield of the heavy hydrogen. The goal \nof the boosted fission bomb is to increase the explosion; the goal of the neutron bomb to decrease long-life \nradioactivity and atomic explosion, while increasing short-life deadly neutron radiation. This type of bomb requires \nthe most advanced nuclear technology both in the production of high purity fissile material, the conventional \nexplosives used to assemble it, the science and geometry of assembling the critical mass, and the technology to \nproduce heavy hydrogen or other fusionable materials in high quantity. \n\n4. The “Salted” or “Doomsday” Bomb: While not strictly speaking a type of bomb in its own right, mention must be \nmade of this type of nuclear warhead. A “salted” bomb is simply a fully fledged atomic or hydrogen bomb to which a \n“doping” or “salting” of highly radioactive material such as cobalt 60 or strontium 90 has been added. The aim is not \nonly to produce a high explosive yield of maximum physical effect, but also to create a cloud of very deadly and very \nlong-lived radiation to drift over an entire province or region in an enemy’s territory. As such, any fully fission or \nfusion warhead may be “salted,” although normally hydrogen bombs were thought to be the best for such purposes, \nsince the mushroom cloud from their explosions reach high into the stratosphere, enabling the fallout to be carried \nover a wide area. These types of doomsday devices obviously had as much repercussion for the nation using them as \nfor the nation being targeted by them. These were the doomsday weapons of the late 1950s and early 1960s. This \ntype of weapon, while monstrous, constitutes an important step for the creation of the third generation of weapon, \nsince to “salt” a bomb with exotic isotopes implies the existence of a sufficiently large and advanced nuclear \ntechnology to create such isotopes in the needed large quantities. This requires a sophisticated reactor technology. \n\nc. Third Generation Weapons: The Pure Fusion, or Pure Hydrogen. Bomb: This is the type of weapon envisioned by project \nDOVE, and alluded to by the Russian military experts cited by Cohen. As has already been seen, it dispenses entirely with \nthe need for an atomic bomb to set off the thermonuclear explosion. Thus, very “small” nuclear explosions can be created \nwhose sole goal is to create deadly, though very short lived, bursts of neutrons over an area several hundreds of yards in \ndiameter, killing all life within it, but causing a minimum of physical damage. This type of thermonuclear weapon requires \nnot only the ability to manufacture heavy hydrogen in sufficient weapons quantity, but also a breakthrough in conventional \nexplosive to achieve the pressures and energies necessary for atoms to fuse, without the necessity of an atom bomb for the \n“trigger. ” \n\nWhat Dr. Cohen mentioned, as has been seen, is a small device with the equivalent explosive yield of ten tons of TNT, what by \nnuclear terms is a “small” explosion. But the idea that such an explosion would cause no physical damage is nonsense. Only imagine \nwhat setting off ten tons of TNT in a normal city block would do, and one gets the idea. In any case, if such a weapon were feasible, \nthen it poses the nuclear nightmare in no uncertain terms, for one would no longer have to worry about acquiring an atomic bomb, a \nmuch more efficient device would be feasible at much less cost. Moreover, with no atom bomb needed, any radioactive effects are \nvery short lived, since the neutrons released by the weapon eventually (and very quickly) ran “out of steam” and lose their lethality. \nIn short, there are relatively no radioactive fallout consequences to a nuclear exchange. \n\nAnd there is one final, even more unthinkable, danger. It will be recalled that thermonuclear weapons can be made to be very \nlarge in terms of their yield, to the tens if not hundreds of megatons. Thus, within the - as yet unknown - limits of the ability of any \nsuch breakthrough in ballotechnic explosives, such fusion bombs could conceivably be made quite large. One is confronted with the \ndreadful prospect of a truly city- (or region-) busting thermonuclear bomb that is not only cheap to produce, light, and comparatively \nsmall, but also one with almost no radioactive consequences to the nation or group using it, and almost no radioactive signature that \nwould allow such a device to be detected.. \n\n\n\n3. The Red Mercury Legend, Recipe, and “Xerum 525” \n\n\nWe now enter the dark and murky world of late twentieth century nuclear weapons research, a world with its own highly \nsuggestive connection to the Bell, for precisely such a breakthrough in conventional explosives is alleged for the mysterious \ncompound “red mercury.” It is therefore worth recounting its legend, the “recipe” for its confection, and their possible relationship to \nthe Bell’s mysterious “Xerum 525”. \n\n\na. The Red Mercury Legend \n\nThe Red Mercury Legend began in the immediate aftermath of the “collapse” of Communist Russia. With the collapse, several \nRussian nuclear scientists found themselves out of work, and out of money, and began to sell Russian nuclear secrets on the black \nmarket. One of the secrets was Red Mercury. Not much would have been known about it had not the story surfaced in connection \nwith a series of bizarre murders in the Republic of South Africa, murders that raised the prospect that South Africa’s own progress in \nnuclear armaments had proceeded much farther along under its apartheid governments than previously imagined.— The story also \nsurfaced, appropriately enough, in Germany, when the German government successfully closed down a number of nuclear \nsmuggling operations, including some allegedly trying to smuggle Red Mercury.— \n\nThe Red Mercury Legend, however, does not have directly to do with the number of deaths that seem to mysteriously occur in \nconnection with it, but with its properties itself, for it is allegedly one of the prized “ballotechnical explosives,” i.e., a “conventional” \nexplosive capable of initiating thermonuclear fusion without an atom bomb. \n\nAuthors Peter Hounam and Steve McQuillan, who researched and published what may be the only book-length investigation of \nthe subject, The Mini-Nuke Conspiracy: Mandela’s Nuclear Nightmare, traced the origin of the substance to secret Russian nuclear \ninstallations around the city of Sverdlovsk.— Contacting a Russian named “George”, they were quickly apprised of its various \nproperties: \n\n“When it is first made, it is a powder which is dark red in colour. But we irradiate it in a nuclear reactor which turns it into a \n\nvery heavy liquid, the colour of wine. It is very, very expensive, because it is so difficult to make.” \n\nThen George lowered his voice: “You know, my friend, that one of the uses of red mercury is for nuclear weapons. You can \nmake them in a different sort of way - nothing like the ones you have in the West - and they can be used by underdeveloped \ncountries. That is why our mafia are in the black market.”— \n\nThe plot thickens, because, of course, Sverdlovsk or Ekaterinburg is where U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down in May, \n1960, trying to photograph the very same nuclear installations. And lest one forget, many allege that Lee Harvey Oswald, during his \n“defection” to the Soviet Union, betrayed the necessary radar secrets and operational parameters of the U-2 that allowed the Soviets \nto shoot Powers down. \n\nIn any case, “George” also related that the uses of Red Mercury could be used in atom bombs in an implosion detonator to \ncompress a plutonium core, while at the same time generating a powerful burst of neutrons to make “the fissioning more \nefficient.”— “George” also revealed the fact that many nations were trying quietly to obtain their own supply from the Russian \nmafia for use in their own nuclear programs, including, predictably enough, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, and much more importantly, \nJapan.— \n\nWierdly enough, the story of Red Mercury first surfaced publicly in post-Communist Russia, where Presidential Order number 29, \nsigned by Boris Yeltsin, authorized a company called Promecology, headed by one Oleg Sadykov, to sell up to ten tons of the \nsubstance annually, an amount with an estimated value of 3.5 billion dollars!— As if this were not enough, Sadykov claimed other \nunusual properties for the substance, among them “faster semiconductors” and newer, “cheaper methods of energy production.”— \n\nAt this point, “George” \n\nWas getting into his stride, disclosing that red mercury, in the form that was leaking on to the black market, perished after \nseveral months and became useless - unless buyers had the facility to refresh it. When it was delivered from the production \nplant, it was in the form of a dark-red honey-like liquid, but as it deteriorated it turned into a powdery sludge.— \n\nPresumably “refreshing” means to re-insert the substance into a reactor core, and this may explain the reason that the Soviet military \n\n\n\ndeveloped a series of small, portable reactors capable of being transported, presumably for battlefield use. \n\nAll of the claims put forward by the Russians in the immediate post-Communist era about “doubling yields” with a “hundredfold \nreduction in weight,” about “red mercury” and new semiconductors and cheaper energy, led British nuclear physicist Frank Bamaby \nto come independently to the same conclusions as did Dr. Sam Cohen; all these claims “must mean that Russia is using a new \ntechnology unreported in Western scientific literature,” since “such a tiny type of nuclear warhead would be impossible to construct \nusing fissile materials such as plutonium- 239 and uranium-235.”— \n\n\nb. The Recipe and “Xerum 525” \n\n\nThen, even more strangely, as stories about the strange substance began to appear in the western press, the Russians themselves \nappeared to be mystified about its properties, for according to a top secret KGB report obtained by British journalist Gwynne \nRoberts - a report prepared by the KGB’s First Chief Directorate, Technical Branch for Boris Yeltsin himself - a few Western \ncompanies were also conducting their own very secret research into the substance, including Rockwell, General Dynamics, British \nAerospace, and - perhaps with its own dark significance - the German armaments and aerospace firm Messerschmidt-Bolkow- \nBlohm, and the giant German electrical company, Siemens.— The same memorandum also noted that the compound was “a \nmercury salt of antimony with the formula Hg 2 Sb 2 0 7 ”— and that it was first produced in the Soviet Union near the high energy \nphysics research institute in Dubna in 1968,— which possessed a reactor “suited to implanting the material with strontium, caesium \nand other isotopes.”— The reactor was suitable, in other words, for “salting” or “doping” the Red Mercury with other highly \nradioactive material. At this point, the resemblance of the substance - heavy liquid, high radioactivity, deep wine colour - to the \nBell’s mysterious “Xerum 525” should be obvious.— \n\nWhatever “Red Mercury” may be chemically, certain conclusions about its confection, about it “recipe”, may now be drawn: \n\n1. Mercury itself was most likely involved in whatever compound was actually made - whether that compound was mercury \nantimony oxide or not - since as a high density liquid metal which can exist in its own radioactive isotope forms, it is an ideal \nvehicle for “salting” or “doping” with other more radioactive materials; \n\n2. Mercury also has its own peculiar stability properties which manifest themselves when it is highly stressed, as pointed out by \nGerlach’s article, and as claimed in ancient texts relating to “mercury vortex engines”; \n\n3. With such a highly “salted” compound, as “Xerum 525” appears to have been, utilized in a device such as the Bell, any \nnumber of strange properties may have been discovered by the Germans; and finally and most importantly, \n\n4. It appears that the essential step in its confection is to subject whatever compound “Red Mercury” represents to exposure in a \nreactor core. More about this crucial point in a moment. \n\nBritish physicist Frank Bamaby, on the basis of classified reports recovered from Russia, learned that the chemical composition of \nthe substance prior to its immersion in a reactor core was also important, for the compound mercury antimony oxide was purportedly \nthen “dissolved in ordinary mercury metal, the type used in thermometers. It was then put in containers which were placed in the \nheart of a nuclear reactor for about twenty days. Under intense neutron bombardment, and perhaps with the addition of catalysts, the \nmaterial was transformed and became a very thick and heavy cherry-red liquid.”— Authors Hounam and McQuillan add an \ninteresting comment: \n\nApparently the procedure was quite complicated and entailed mixing the powder with ordinary mercury in roughly equal molar \n\nweights, then adding other chemicals whose recipe was a closely guarded secret. After irradiation, the mixture was heated to \n\nevaporate the remaining mercury metal, leaving behind the gel.— \n\nOne may guess that perhaps the “secret ingredients” were hafnium or tantalum isomers, for reasons that will be apparent in a \nmoment. \n\nNote again the crucial requirement of immersion in a reactor for the precise purpose of subjecting the compound to high intensity \nneutron bombardment. We are now in a position to speculate why the material has such a high alleged density, and why it seems to \n“decay” after a few months, requiring “refreshing” by re-immersion in a reactor, for the chemical composition may be such that it \nallows the compound to absorb an excessively high and abnormal number of neutrons, which then slowly decays again. This would \nexplain its extreme density. Likewise readers of my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, will also recall \nmention of the Japanese intercept detailing German research in extremely high density materials such as obtained in certain types of \nstars, an allusion, perhaps, to precisely such German work with high density radioactive compounds immersed in nuclear reactors. \n\n\nFinally, if the “recipe” for the confection of Red Mercury sounds a bit familiar, it should, for after all, it was Gerlach who hinted at \nwhat the possible inspiration may have been: alchemy. \n\n\nc. Nuclear Isomers, Spin, GRASERS, and Gerlach \n\n\nBut why isotopes of hafnium and tantalum as the “secret ingredient(s)”? These substances are a strange form of radioactive \nisotope known as nuclear isomers, and isomers have some very strange properties indeed. Discovered in 1921, isomers are simply \nmetastable or “extremely stable” forms of atoms that are brought about by a state of excitation of protons or neutrons in their nucleus, \nsuch that they require a change in their spin before they can release their pent-up energy. We are now a step closer to understanding \nthe Bell, since it now appears that the device, due to the presence of “Xerum 525” was much more than a high-voltage, counter¬ \nrotating plasma trap as conjectured by Witkowski. It certainly was that, but it was also a kind of reactor as well, designed to release \nnuclear energy by extremely high stresses brought about by high speed rotation and, in my own speculative reconstruction, by abrupt \nhigh voltage direct current pulsations. \n\nMost isomers have unusually short half-lives, but in the case of tantalum-180m, its half life is an extremely long 10 15 years, or ten \nquadrillion years. And oddly enough, tantalum-180m is thought to have some connection to exploding stars, to supernovas. \n\nHafnium- 178-2m is yet another metastable isomer, with a half life of a modest 31 years, but also apparently the isomer with the \nhighest excitation energy, giving for one kilogram approximately a quarter megaton of yield of energy, mostly in the form of gamma \nrays. As such, it is one substance being investigated by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) as a possible \nballotechnic explosive, capable not only for use in “pure fusion” bombs but also as a means for pumping a gamma-ray laser, or \nGRASER, recalling the Mossbauer Effect outlined in the previous chapter. \n\nNote now what we have: \n\n1. Isomers release their energy through changes in their spin; \n\n2. Nuclear magnetic spin resonance and gravity are the specialized fields of Prof. Dr. Walther Gerlach, project head of the Bell; \n\n3. The Bell employed a heavy liquid substance called “Xerum 525”, probably a “salted” compound based in part on mercury; \n\n4. This compound, since it was “salted”, depended for its creation on immersion over a period of time in a reactor core to \nsubject the material to neutron bombardment, creating a substance of abnormally high density; \n\n5. World War Two Japanese intercepts refer to Nazi research in extremely high density materials for fusion research; \n\n6. Descriptions of Red Mercury are eerily similar to ’’Xerum 525, and Red Mercury is purportedly a “ballotechnic” chemical \nexplosive capable of generating fusion bombs without the need for an atom bomb; \n\n7. “Xerum 525” was subjected to high velocity counter-rotation or stress inside the Bell; \n\n8. ’’Xerum 525” may also have been subjected to repeated abrupt extremely high voltage direct current pulses inside the Bell; \n\n9. Gerlach wrote, nine years before the Nazis took power, of the need for a large scale project to investigate the phenomenon of \nmercury transmutation when mercury was subjected to precisely such stressing; \n\n10. Other “occult” and “esoteric” sources have long alleged that some similar such project was conducted in secret, by various \nsecret societies in Germany prior to the Nazi era. \n\nAll these things combined tend to corroborate the notion that not only does the Bell represent a project most likely carried out over a \nlong period of time, a project that the Nazis inherited from Weimar Germany and not one that they initiated , but it also corroborates \nthe notion that at least some of this technology, probably in rudimentary form, made its way into the Soviet Union after the war, \nwhere it became the basis for the Russians’ own research into ballotechnics and their peculiar properties. \n\n\n\nC. Back to the Nazi Atom Bomb: The Implications of the Ohrdruf Test Reconsidered \n\n\nBut all these things not only suggest but require the use of a reactor in the confection of the compound, and this is problematic, \nsince, after all, the Nazis were not supposed to have been successful in building a reactor. After all, even on the most radical \nreconstruction of their nuclear program, one that would allow them the achievement of a uranium fueled atom bomb, they never had \na plutonium bomb because they were unable to synthesize that element in a reactor. No reactor, no plutonium bomb. No reactor, no \n“ballotechnic”, no ability to “salt” a compound like “Xerum 525” by neutron bombardment - and neutron bombardment and \nabsorption is the only conceivably effective way to achieve anomalously high density materials, highly speculative though these \nthoughts may be. \n\nAll these considerations lead inevitably back to the alleged German test of a small critical mass, high yield atom bomb at or near \nthe Ohrdruf troop parade ground on March 4, 1945.— \n\n\n1. The Claims for the Ohrdruf Test \n\n\nIn order to appreciate the significance of the Ohrdruf atomic bomb test for the story of the Bell being developed here, it is \nnecessary to reprise some of the remarks I made in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, for readers \nwho may not have read that book, or who may not be familiar with the Ohrdruf story. The test was first brought to the attention of \nthe German researchers Edgar Meyer and Thomas Mehner by an elderly German expatriate in Argentina by the name of Adolf \nBemd Freier, who shortly before his death, told of the test of an atom bomb on the troop parade ground near the village of Ohrdruf \non March 4, 1945. At this point, it is necessary to cite my remarks from Reich of the Black Sun rather extensively, in order to \nhighlight the problems it poses: \n\nIn any case, the most problematical aspect of the alleged test of an atom bomb by the Nazis in the Orhdruf-Three Comers \nregion of Thuringia comes from a rather specific, and rather startling, assertion. According to Freier, the test took place on \nMarch 4, 1945 at the old troop parade ground at Ohrdruf. There, a small scaffold about 6 meters high had been erected, at the \ntop of which a small “atomic weapon”— was placed. The weapon, according to Freier, was “100 g”, a mere one hundred \ngrams! \n\nThis is one of the most significant, and highly problematical, allegations regarding the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb \nproject, made by someone supposedly involved in it, for as will be immediately obvious, 100 grams is far short of the 50 or so \nkilograms of critical mass needed for a uranium-based atom bomb, as has been seen, and it is still well below the amount \nneeded for the critical mass for a typical plutonium bomb. Yet, Freier is insistent upon this point, and moreover alleges that all \nthe “slaves”, the luckless concentration camp victims that were forced to take part in the test, within a circle of 500-600 meters \nfrom ground zero were killed.— This would give an area of approximately 1 to 1.2 kilometers of blast damage, roughly the \neffect of a modem tactical nuclear bomb. Such a blast radius would require an enormous amount of the then available \nconventional explosives, and that amount would far exceed the mere 100 grams Freier alleges for the device. These points \nindicate that the “A-Waffe: or “atomic weapon” was in fact a fully fledged atom bomb. So how does one explain the \nextraordinarily small critical mass, especially since the Manhattan Project was aiming for a uranium critical mass of around 50 \nkilograms? \n\nThe question deserves serious consideration, for it affords yet another possible clue - if the allegation is to be credited with \naccuracy - into the real nature of the Nazi atom bomb project. We have seen already that the project was developed under \nseveral different and discreet groups for reasons partly due to security, and for reasons partly due to the practical nature of the \n\nGerman program.The real atom bomb development occurred far from the prying eyes of Allied intelligence, under the \n\nauspices of the Reichspost and more importantly, under the direct auspices of the SS. \n\nThe second fact of the German atom bomb project we have likewise previously encountered: its emphasis on what was \npractically achievable during the war. Hence, while the Germans knew of the possibilities of plutonium and a plutonium-based \natom bomb, and therefore knew that a functioning reactor used to produce plutonium for bombs would thereby enable \nGermany to develop more bombs for the same investment of fissile material, they also knew that a major technical hurdle lay \nacross the path: the development of a successful reactor in the first place. Thus, as has been previously argued, they opted to \ndevelop a uranium-based bomb only, since uranium could be enriched to weapons grade purity without the necessity of the \ndevelopment of a reactor, and since they already possessed the technologies to do so, if employed en masse. Fike its American \nManhattan Project counterpart, the SS-run program relied on massive numbers of enrichment units to separate and purify \nisotope. \n\nNow let us extend this line of reasoning further. Germany was also seeking to be able to deploy such bombs as warheads on \nits rockets. And that meant, given their limited lift capabilities, that the weight of the warheads had somehow to be reduced by \nseveral orders of magnitude for their rockets to be able to carry them. And there is an economic factor. Knowing that their \nindustrial capacity would be strained by the effort, even with the help of tens of thousands of slave laborers from the camps, \nanother problem may have presented itself to the Germans, a problem illumined for them by their own knowledge of the \npossibilities offered by plutonium-based bombs: How does one get more bang for the Reichsmark without the use of \nplutonium ? Is there a way to rely on less uranium in a critical mass assembly than is conventionally thought?— \n\nAnd at this point, the reader will recall the history of nuclear weapons generations given earlier in this chapter, for there is such a \nway, via “boosted fission,” i.e., through the addition of some high neutron emitting source to the atomic fuel to spit extra fast \nneutrons into the chain reaction than would be caused by the critical mass itself. In short, the Germans were already thinking in terms \nof second generation nuclear weaponry.— And one such neutron emitting source is precisely deuterium and tritium; \n\n\n\nThus, “boosted fission” would have afforded the German bomb program a practical way to increase the number of bombs \navailable to them, and a reliable method for achieving an uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction with lower purity of enriched \nmaterial. It is perhaps quite significant, then, that Freier’s testimony concerning the Three Comers underground weapons \nfactories also mentions the existence of an underground heavy water plant in the facilities, for heavy water, of course, contains \natoms of deuterium and tritium (heavy hydrogen atoms with one and two extra neutrons in the nucleus respectively).— \n\nAnd there I let matters lie, without going into further comment on the scientific and historical implications of Freier’s allegations. \nThat some sort of atomic test did take place in Ohrdruf seems apparent from the physical evidence of the region: old tree stumps are \nflattened in a radial pattern from a common center, as if blasted away in a huge explosion. And the region also has the highest \nbackground radiation of any area of modem Germany, a background radiation that is anomalous. \n\nBut let us consider, for a moment, the implication of that 100 grams. If that 100 grams represented plutonium, then it is just barely \nconceivable that the weapon tested at Ohrdruf was a fully functional “boosted fission” atom bomb, for that is just about the minimum \npossible amount of plutonium for a conventional modem boosted fission tactical nuclear bomb. \n\nBut therein, too, lies the problem, for that very small amount of plutonium would require by the nature of the case a very high \npurity of plutonium. It would require not only a reactor technology, but a rather well-advanced one, and of course, German failures \nin building a conventional graphite moderated reactor are well-known, as are Heisenberg’s own clumsy attempts at construction of a \nheavy-water moderated reactor towards the end of the war.— What all this leads up to is that a third generation nuclear weapon, not \na neutron bomb as alleged by William Lyne, nor a “boosted fission” bomb as I implied in Reich of the Black Sun, but a pure fusion \ndevice, a pure hydrogen bomb, may in fact been the type of device tested at Ohrdruf, one relying, not on fission, but on the fusion of \nheavy hydrogen, to achieve its yield. Only such a device is in keeping with the very small weight and very high yield recorded for it. \nThat the Germans had the technology to produce the heavy water for such a device is known. But to produce a conventional \nexplosive to achieve the extremely high density and fusion energies necessary is another matter, unless, of course, one recalls the \nBell and its mysterious “Xerum 525” and its eerily peculiar resemblance to the alleged ballotechnical explosive compound Red \nMercury. \n\n\n\nIt will be noted that the bomb contained alternating layers of U 235 and paraffin, which is used as a moderator to stop thermal \nneutrons from initiating fission in the uranium until the bomb smashed against the ground, assembling the critical mass. Note \nalso the small sphere in the center of the device. This, like its Manhattan Bomb “Fat Man” counterpart, is an “urchin” of \nneutron emitting material that is smashed by the plunger, spitting out more thermal neutrons into the chain reaction. In short, this \nbomb is designed to “semi-fission” or “fizzle” with a colossal explosion and, more importantly, being a ground impact device, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto chum up a massive cloud of deadly radioactivity. Additionally, there is the extremely slight chance that the critical mass \nassembly in this device, even though assymetrical, may have been fast enough to achieve full fission, though still well below \nthe levels of efficiency as those achieved in the Little Boy bomb. \n\nBut we are still not off the hook yet, for every mention of ballotechnics, from the alleged “Red Mercury” to exotic nuclear \nisomers, require at some point in the recipe a process of synthesis of the compound by neutron bombardment and absorption in a \nreactor. In short, one still requires a reactor. So both the Ohrdruf test, and the Bell’s “Xerum 525” point unmistakably to the \nexistence of a well-developed, though still quite hidden and unknown reactor technology inside Nazi Germany. And since their \ngraphite moderated reactors were known to be failures, and since Heisenberg’s heavy water moderated reactors and their “failures” \nare also well-known proto-Chemobyl “disasters”, what other options were there? \n\n\n\n2. The Implied Existence of a Reactor Technology: Hartek and Houtermann’s “Cold” Reactors and the “Recipe” \n\n\nOddly enough, it is the physicist Fritz Floutermanns and the nuclear chemist Paul Flartek who point clearly and unequivocally to \nthe existence within Nazi Germany of some very unusual, and even very refined, ideas for reactors with unusual, and very available \nmoderators. \n\nFlartek had early on hit upon the simple expedient of using tons of dry ice as a moderator in a reactor, a solution that avoided the \ncooling and energy problems of a conventional graphite reactor and moreover served his purposes well: the creation of large \namounts of nuclear waste to be dusted over enemy cities.— \n\nMore significantly, as outlined in chapter nine of Reich of the Black Sun, Floutermanns pointed the way to a methane cooled and \nmoderated reactor. In any case, in both concepts one sees the same principles and aims at work: the creation of a relatively “cool” \nreactor that avoided the problems associated with graphite, and the creation of a reactor for the express purpose of creating large \nquantities of isotopes. Both concepts, in any case, would have leant themselves rather more easily to the insertion of materials for \n“salting” via neutron bombardment. In other words, both types of reactor, and especially some version of Floutermanns’ methane \nreactor, would have been ideal designs for creating a “doped” compound such as Red Mercury or Xerum 525. \n\nThe question of whether or not the Nazis would have actually constructed and operated some version of either reactor is a moot \none, since the SS-run black projects would have concealed their existence quite successfully, as it did with the uranium enrichment \nfacilities at Auschwitz. Given the nature of this program it is extremely unlikely that the SS would not have attempted from the \nearliest date feasible to construct and operate a reactor. The existence of the Ohdruf test and the Bell’s mysterious “Xerum 525” \npoint clearly, if not entirely conclusively, to the existence of just such a hidden and operational reactor technology inside the Third \nReich, a technology that, as the existence of ’’Xerum 525” indicates, was used in some very exotic materials engineering. The Bell \nitself may thus be not only related to such technology, but it is also conceivable that it might, to coin a pun, be at its nucleus. Not \nonly may the Germans have discovered some prototypical ballotechnic in “Xerum 525” but they may also have discovered some \neffect similar to the Mossbauer Effect. \n\n\nD. Briefly Back to Roswell and MAJIC-12: General Nathan Twining’s “White Hot Intelligence Estimate” \n\nReconsidered \n\n\nReaders of my previous book Reich of the Black Sun will doubtless be thinking that all this discussion about radioactively \n“doped” materials such as Red Mercury and “Xerum 525,” as well as all the discussion on high electrical discharges and spin, \nsounds vaguely familiar. But for those for whom it does not, the following MAJIC-12 document, the “White Hot Intelligence \nEstimate,” prepared as a technical overview of the craft and technologies recovered at Roswell, is cited just as it was cited in Reich of \nthe Black Sun: \n\n18. The following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside ULAT- \n1 : \n\n\na. UF6 in metallic form;— \n\nb. Hydrogen-fluoride gas; \n\nc. Water and uranium tetrafluoride; \n\nd. Powdered magnesium and potassium chlorate; \n\ne. Metal similar to lead with a chocolate brown color; \n\nf. U-235 in metallic form; \n\ng. Plastic-like material similar to NE 102; \n\nh. Beryllium; \n\ni. Pure aluminum; \n\nh.(sic) Thorium isotope material; \n\nj. (sic) plutonium powder.— \n\n\nAs I point out in Reich of the Black Sun, this list of materials, while exotic, was not beyond the technological capabilities of 1940s \nmanufacture, either for Germany or for America. But what is unusual is that these materials are all components of what the document \nitself specifies is a “neutronic engine.” Moreover, as other MAJIC-12 documents make clear, some of the scientists consulted by the \nearly Roswell investigators were precisely the Paperclip expatriates Von Braun, Steinhof, and others. \n\nAs is likewise observed in Reich of the Black Sun, this exotic mixture of materials, like much else in the documents’ technical \ndescriptions of the Roswell wreckage, points to technologies clearly associated with the Bell, technologiues similar to “Xerum 525”, \nand thus clearly point to Nazi Germany.— \n\n\nE. A Summary and Conclusions \n\n\nSo, looking back over part two, what does one have? \n\n1. The Bell represented the culmination of a project possibly begun in the mid-1920s, under the instigation and inspiration of \nWalther Gerlach; \n\n2. The Bell was intentionally designed, if one combines the insightful views of Witkowski with my own speculations, as “a \nplasma trap” and oscillator designed to subject highly doped radioactive elements in compound with mercury to extremes of \nmechanical rotation and electrical stress; \n\n3. The purpose of this device may have been, in part, to test the gravitational, vorticular, and “scalar” physics implications of \nGerlach’s and his student Hilgenberg’s views of the vorticular stmcture of matter and of the aether itself, the ultimate \ningredients in any planet-busting doomsday weapon; \n\n4. Thus, the project may have been inspired in part by a paleophysical “reconstruction” of ancient esoteric and classical texts \nregarding the properties of mercury and its “transmutability”, as Gerlach’s references to “alchemy” suggest; \n\n5. Thus, the project may have also been intended to study not only the uses of this theory and technology for energy production \nand propulsion, but, as the existence of “Xerum 525” and its similarities to the alleged “ballotechnic” Red Mercury suggest, it \nmay also have been intended to create and or investigate the areas of extremely high density matter states and their use as \npotential weapons in their own right, as distinct from any “scalar” weapons potential as may have existed under point 3 \nabove. \n\nThus stated it is small wonder that the SS went to such extreme lengths to protect and preserve the secrets of the Bell. After all, what \nlittle is known of it is known only from one war crimes trial affidavit of an SS general being tried in post-war Poland for crimes \nagainst his own SS, and from the handful of surviving concentration camp victims who worked on the project or in its immediate \nenvirons, and who witnessed its effects. And of course, one of its original team members, Dr. Kurt Debus, was subsequently \nemployed by NASA in a very critical position: as a director of the Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida. Interestingly enough, \nDebus never once mentioned any connection, or gave any inkling, of the existence of a project as secret and as advanced as the Bell. \nWere it not for the action of the Polish government declassifying SS General Sporrenberg’s - the general who was actually tasked \nwith murdering the Bell’s research technicians for the SS - war crimes trial affidavit, were it not for the stories of the few remaining \neyewitnesses, and for the efforts of Igor Witkowski, nothing whatsoever would be known of it to this day. \n\nBut what they do tell is enough, if one follows the technical and theoretical clues through to their modem physics analogues, for \nthey tell of a physics, a technology, a propulsion and a weaponry so advanced and so potentially destructive, that their conceptual \nbasis remains hidden and cloaked behind the “public consumption physics” of relativity and an equally if not more severely flawed \nnineteenth century electrodynamics. Something else altogether occurred in Nazi Germany; some other paradigm was adopted early \non and pursued with all the economic and scientific resources and intellectual brilliance that a modem and technologically \nsophisticated great power could muster. A whole new paradigm of physics - a combination of vortex aether, scalar, quantum- \nelectrodynamic and nuclear physics — appears not only to have been outlined, but conceptually and experimentally developed.

So, in this chapter of extensive documentary analysis and \ncomparison of their contents with known Nazi technology, perhaps two pictures will be an adequate backdrop for our discussion. I \nam not the first to notice this comparison, nor, I imagine, will I be the last. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning again that fact which \nmost UFOlogists know: that the “modem era” of the UFO began with pilot Kenneth Arnold sighting several silvery metal objects \nskipping across the skies of Washington state while he was flying his private plane. Arnold’s sighting, just a few days before the \ncelebrated Roswell incident, inaugurated the modem era of the UFO. \n\n\nKenneth Arnold and his Sketch of His UFO, 1947 \n\n\n\nBut few are aware of the peculiar resemblance of Arnold’s “UFO” to a piece of very real, and very German, hardware already flying \nin 1939. the Flying Wing of the Horten Brothers. \n\n\nThe Horten Brothers’ Flying Wing over Gottingen in 1939 \n\n\nAnd a close comparison of Arnold’s sketch with the Horten brothers’ designs for a jet-powered flying wing will exhibit even \nstronger parallels. \n\n\nThe Hortens’ Design for a Jet Powered Flying Wing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. MAJIC-12 Documentary Analysis \n\n\nMany UFOlogists took their cue from Frank Edwards’ bestselling Flying Saucers, Serious Business, maintaining that the early \npost-war UFO activity was reconnaissance of our military bases, and particularly, of our atomic testing: \n\nTo this growing list of such “coincidences” we should by all means add the following cases: \n\nThe explosions of the first manmade atomic bombs in 1945 were followed by the appearance of UFO’s in numbers in \n1949.... \n\nThe 1947 mass appearance of UFO’s over the United States included numerous sightings around our atomic installations at \nHanford and Oak Ridge, as well as the great scarred area near Alamagordo, New Mexico, where we had fired our first atomic \ndevice.— \n\nThis idea was picked up by Stanton Friedmann and others, who maintained the very plausible scenario that E.T. was monitoring our \nburgeoning nuclear and soon to be thermonuclear military capabilities, as any prudent intelligent society would monitor the military \nactivities of a potential threat. \n\nSo far, so good. \n\nBut then Friedmann and others failed to notice the significance of the parenthetical statements Edwards himself makes in the \nabove quotation at the ellipsis, statements I deliberately omitted from the above quotation: \n\n[The two bombs were exploded over Japan: the 1946 UFO’s were over Scandinavia and Russia. If they were looking for the \nsource of those atomic flashes, they had the right latitude but the wrong longitude.]- \n\nBut, given the speculative history recounted in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, and the \ncircumstantial case presented in it for German tests of nuclear devices in 1944 and early 1945 in the Baltic and in Thuringia, then the \nlogic takes on a whole new context and sinister significance. If “E.T.” was indeed monitoring atomic tests and human intentions, \nthen the 1946 “fly-bys” over the Baltic and Scandinavia were indeed at the right place. \n\nAnd if one presses the logic a bit more, then it would appear that where the Nazis and their advanced technology went, E.T. and \nhis reconnoitering UFOs were not far behind. \n\nWhich brings us at last to Roswell, to MAJIC-12, to Col. Philip J. Corso’s well-known version of events and his explanation of \nthe “real origin” of certain technologies, and of course, to the New Mexico Nazis. \n\nWhile more will be said about Col. Corso’s “Roswell-ET” thesis of the origin of some technologies typical of the mid-to-late 20 th \ncentury, it is worth citing his own words here, since they bear directly on the alleged MAJIC-12 documents examined below: \n\nMy boss, General Trudeau, asked me to use the army’s ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filter \nthe Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. Today, \nitems such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle-beam devices, and even the Kevlar material \nin bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and \nturned up in my files fourteen years later.— \n\nThe thesis is quite clear, an extraterrestrial craft crashed and was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, and the recovered \nextraterrestrial technology was back-engineered, leading directly to the integrated circuit via the transistor, to fiber optics, to the laser, \nand a host of other devices and technologies. This thesis must be bom in mind as the following MAJIC-12 documents are analyzed, \nfor we shall return to it at the end of this chapter. \n\nDrs. Robert and Ryan Wood are well-known for their document authentication efforts concerning the MAJIC-12 “Cooper- \nCantwheel” documents. Some of these documents they published in a book, which, according to the statements on their own \nwebsite, argue conclusively for the existence of “ET” and the exotic “ET” origin of the crashed and recovered craft. \n\nHowever, some alleged MAJIC-12 documents that are not included in Robert and Ryan Wood’s MAJESTIC-12 book, strongly if \nnot conclusively indicate the continuation of an independent Nazi development of advanced aerodynes and propulsions systems \nbegun during the war. These documents furthermore imply a clear connection between MJ-12 and the assassination of President \nJohn F. Kennedy, and the subsequent mysterious death of former CIA Director William Colby. \n\nThese documents, analyzed individually in this chapter, are: \n\n1. A Memorandum of the Air Materials Command, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, classified SECRET and dated in September of \n\n\n1947, to Brigadier General George Schulgen at the Offices of the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces; \n\n2. A Memorandum of a “Research and Development Laboratory” Concerning Flying Saucers submitted to the Commanding \nGeneral, Air Materials Command, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, and also to the Attention of Brigadier C. P. Cabell as \nUSAAF Headquarters in Washington, dated 2 September (1947), with no classification indicated; \n\n3. An apparent NS A Intercept between a American agent Code-named “Joshua” to a Soviet counterpart, mentioning “33 \ninvestors” as possible independent sources of funding for Soviet SDI research and development; \n\n4. A Memo from “Thomas Cantwheel” Concerning Recovery, Building, and Test-Flight of so-called “S” Craft based on \nRecovery of Crashed Vehicle in Louisiana in 1942; \n\n5. A Letter from “Source 1” to Timothy Cooper connecting MJ-12 to the Assassination of President Kennedy, dated June 23, \n1999; \n\n6. A Second Letter from ’’Source 1” to Timothy Cooper outlining significant Details of MJ-12 Operations, including its alleged \nprivatization by President Nixon in 1969, dated July 7, 1999; \n\n7. Dr. Edward Teller’s Pitch to President Reagan for SDI, no date and no classification; \n\n8. Annex C Fragment indicating MJ-12 involvement in assassination of Secretary of War James Forrestal; \n\n9. Double Top Secret Letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to General Marshal, concerning recovered Cape Girardeau \nCraft in 1941, dated February 22/24, 1944; \n\n10. Top Secret Letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to General Marshall concerning recovery of crashed vehicle, dated \nFebruary 27, 1942; \n\n11. The “Bowen UFO Encyclopedia.” \n\nIn analyzing these documents, I have retyped them word for word as they appear on the Wood’s website, preserving the various \nfont style changes, and noting page breaks in the original documents as follows: “===END===” or “====END PUBLICLY \nRECEIVED DOCUMENT====” or some similar notation. All italicized portions are emphases added to the documents by me to \nhighlight those aspects discussed in the analysis sections which immediately follow each document. Such italicized portions do not \noccur in the documents themselves unless otherwise noted. I have also indicated blacked out text by strings of questions marks - \n??????? - and attempted to preserve all capitalization. \n\nFinally, for purposes of this chapter, authenticity issues are not discussed, since this would make an already lengthy book grow to \nenormous proportions. Instead, the documents are presumed to exist in the fuzzy area between “plain straight legitimate” and \n“cleverly concocted disinformation,” i.e., as even in the latter case containing some legitimate information. I do not believe that the \ndocuments are hoaxes outright. That being said, on to the documents themselves. \n\n\n\n\n1. Document 1: Air Materials Command Secret Memo to Brig. Gen. George Schulgen, Sept 1947: \n\n\nThe text of the document is as follows, all emphasis has been added: \n\nS ECRET \n\n\nHEADQUARTERS \n\nAIR MATERIAL COMMAND \n\n\n1. REPLY ADDRESS BOTH \nCOMMUNICATION AND EN¬ \nVELOPE TO COMMANDING \nGENERAL, AIR MATERIAL \nCOMMAND, ATTENTION \nFOLLOWING OFFICE SYMBOL \nTSDIN \n\n\nTSDIN/HMM/ig/6-4100 \nWRIGHT FIELD, DAYTON, OHIO \n\n\nSUBJECT: AMC Opinion Concerning “Flying Discs” \n\nTO: Commanding General \nArmy Air Forces \nWashington 25, D. C. \n\nATTENTION: Brig. General George Schulgen \nAC/AS-2 \n\n1. As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented below the considered opinion of this Command concerning the so-called \n“Flying Discs.” This opinion is based on interrogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by \npersonnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Division T-3. This opinion was arrived at in a conference between \npersonnel form the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office, Chief of Engineering Division, and the Aircraft, \nPower Plant and Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3. \n\n2. It is the opinion that: \n\na. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. \n\nb. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as \nmanmade aircraft. \n\nc. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors. \n\nd. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and \naction which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the \npossibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely. \n\ne. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows: - \n\n1. Metallic or light reflecting surface. \n\nU-39552 \n\nSECRET \n\n\n\n=========[PAGE BREAK]======= Sl ( \\<\\ I \n\nBasic Ltr for CG, AMC, WF to CO, AAF, Wash. D. C. subj “AMC Opinion Concerning ’’Flying Discs”. \n\n2. Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object apparently was operating under high performance \nconditions. \n\n3. Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top. \n\n4. Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects. \n\n5. Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial rumbling roar was noted. \n\n6. Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated. \n\nf. It is possible within the present U. S. knowledge - provided extensive detailed development is undertaken - to \nconstruct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph (a) above which would be \ncapable of an approximate range of 7000 miles at subsonic speeds. \n\ng. Any developments in this country along the lines indicated would be extremely expensive, time consuming and at the \nconsiderable expense of current projects and therefore, if directed, should be set up independently of existing projects. \n\nh. Due consideration must be given the following: - \n\n1. The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the product of some high security project not known \nto AC/AS- 2 or this Command. \n\n2. The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered vehicles which would undeniably prove the \nexistence of these objects. \n\n3. The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our \ndomestic knowledge. \n\n\n3. It is recommended that:- \n\na. Headquarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification and Code Name for a \nDetailed study of this matter to include the preparation of complete sets of all available and pertinent data which will \nthen be made available to the Army, Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDS, the Air Force Scientific Advisory \nGroup, NACA, and the RAND and NEPA projects for comments and recommendations, with a preliminary report to \nbe forwarded within 15 days of receipt of the data and a detailed report thereafter every 30 days as the investi- \nSKCKKT \n\n-2- U-39552 \n\n==========[END]======== \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n1. Note that no mention is made of the ET Hypothesis for the origin of recovered vehicular technology. This is extremely odd, \nfor this fact places the memo in the same class as General Twining’s “Air Accident Report” as reviewed in my Reich of the \nBlack Sun.— Odder still is the fact that this date is also in the same approximate time frame as the “White Hot Intelligence \nEstimate”, which, according to the analysis in Reich of the Black Sun,— contains two contradictory data-sets - the \ntechnological arguing for terrestrial origins and the biological arguing for ET origins - that are obfuscated in favor of the ET \nHypothesis of its origin. The curious omission of the mention of any ET Hypothesis as an explanation of the craft’s origins \ncan be explained in one of two ways: \n\na. As the document itself avers, the origins of the craft are terrestrial, even though its technology is exotic; or, \n\nb. The absence of mention of the ET Hypothesis may be a reflection of a lower level of involvement, i.e., it is not \nmentioned except in the upper echelons of the organization that is beginning to emerge as “MJ- 12”. A lower level of \ninvolvement, however, is itself odd, since by some accounts the recovered craft was shipped to Wright Field directly \nfrom Texas, where it had been flown from Roswell AAFB. Thus, in terms of the internal contents of the document, \nthe stronger of the two interpretations is that no ”ET Hypothesis” deep cover story is needed. The recovered craft and \nits technology are therefore terrestrial, though exotic, in origin and nature. \n\n2. Certain statements in the memo, considered individually and collectively, point to a terrestrial origin for the craft, and given \nthe exotic nature of the recovered technology, these can only come from Nazi Germany: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. The craft is “of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft;” that is, nothing about the \ncraft suggests to Air Materials Command (AMC) an extra-terrestrial origin; its size is consistent with the size and \nscale of human physiology; \n\nb. “The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and \naction which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the \npossibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.'” This statement can be \nexplained by references to known, though exotic, technologies of Nazi secret weapons and their alleged performance \ncharacteristics (extreme rates of climb), as well as German progress in remote control of aircraft;— \n\nc. The “Absence of trail, except in a few instances when the object apparently was operating under high performance \nconditions” finds an analogue in the assertions of Vesco and Childress in Operation Intercept and Man-Made UFOs \nthat the so-called Mark I saucers were but exotic but standard suction (jet) aircraft, which left the telltail contrails.— \nThe statement “Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a substantial rumbling roar was noted,” \nmay also point to German development under Prof. Dr. Lippisch and others of high performance, high altitude ramjet \nengines; and finally, \n\nd. The statement “Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated” once again indicates much too low a \nperformance for any interplanetary craft, but point much more directly to something terrestrial. It should be noted that \nthis speed is far below the 1200mph reported in the White Hot Intelligence Estimate of the same time period.— We \nare therefore dealing with two different craft, or the same craft has been observed under different circumstances. This \nvery low performance figure may likewise indicate the nature of the document itself as being deliberately concocted \ndisinformation, since such a speed would hardly call forth a secret memorandum. In my opinion, however, it may \nsimply be due to a observation under low performance conditions. \n\n3. The document concludes with three breathtaking statements that shatter the ET Hypothesis: \n\n“Due consideration must be given the following: - \n\n1. The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the product of some high security project not known to \nAC/AS-2 or this Command. \n\n2. The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered vehicles which would undeniably prove the existence oj \nthese objects. \n\n3. The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic \nknowledge. ” \n\nNote that Air Materials Command, by statements (1) and (3), is not even thinking in terms of a recovered ET vehicle, i.e., \nnothing about the observed technology is so exotic as to compel the ET explanation. Note also, however, the extraordinarily \ncurious statement in item (2), which suggests either that nothing was recovered at Roswell - a conclusion this author rejects - \nor that AMC has not actually seen what was recovered, or that what was recovered was not actually a UFO. Statement (3) \nwould tend to mitigate against the interpretation that AMC has not actually seen what was recovered in the formulation of \nthis memo, since any number of propulsion mechanisms could have suggested themselves to AMC in the absence of any \nactual craft to examine. That is AMC could just as easily have proposed magnetic, electromagnetic, or other forms of field \npropulsion if its conclusions were only based on the reports of the flight performance characteristics of UFOs. Therefore, it is \nmost plausible that AMC had actually seen the craft and based its summary on an actual analysis of its propulsion unit. In this \ncontext, statement (3) becomes much more significant, since the only other country with a known interest in nuclear means of \naircraft propulsion at that time period was Nazi Germany.— It is to be recalled that one specific area of research of the \nKammlerstab was precisely in nuclear aircraft propulsion. \n\nWhich leaves the statement “ Due consideration must be given the following: - The possibility that these objects are oj \ndomestic origin - the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command” to be explained. First it \nis to be noted that no mention is made of the possibility of the technology being Soviet. Secondly, it is clear from the \nstatement itself that AMC considers the possibility that it represents a project so black and secret that it is simply unknown to \nit. This would also allow the possibility that the technology is the product of a wholly independent project. In short, it allows \nthe idea of a continued and independent Nazi continuation of its wartime projects. \n\n4. These conclusions indicate that AMC is at a loss to explain the actual origin of the craft, though it is clear that it thinks of its \norigins as strictly terrestrial. Therefore the combined weight of the statements (1) and (3) at the end of the document point to \nthe existence of a program of exotic aerodyne research and development wholly unknown to the USAAF and its premier air \ntechnology analysis unit, the AMC at Wright Field. Given that the document nowhere mentions the alleged recovery of ET \n\n\nbiology, this tends to support the conclusions reached in Reich of the Black Sun that nothing about the recovered technology \nor its observed performance characteristics compelled to the conclusion that the craft was ET in origin. Indeed, the document \nimplies the existence of a program, possibly completely independent of the US government, about which AMC knows \nnothing. \n\n\n\n2. Document 2: Analytical Report of Research and Develop Laboratory of 2 September (1947) \n\n\nResearch and Development \nLaboratory \n\n\nAnalytical Report \nIJKAD-2B/AO \n\n\n2 September \n\nSUBJECT Flying Saucers \n\nTO: Commanding General \nAir Material Command \nWright Field \nDayton, Ohio \nATTN: AC/A2-g \nBrig. Gen. C. P. Cabell \nHeadquarters, Army Air Force \nWashington 25, D. C. \n\n1 . Av requested by your letter of 16 July 1947 this office has produced its conclusions on the manufacture, function and \npossible origin of the above referenced subject. On-site preliminary study data provided by personnel of T-2 and T-3, search \nand recovery team of the AFSWP, ‘ Paper Clip’ personnel, select personnel of the Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory \nGroup and personnel of the Atomic Energy Commission Advisory Committee was utilized in the construction of our \nanalysis. \n\n2. The analyses of the Office of Research and Development are: \n\na. Aerodynamics and design evaluation studies performed by the Aircraft, Power Pant and Propeller Faboratories of \nEngineering Division T-2 personnel, has concluded that some nation has reached a stage of flight development in \nwhich the present ideas are entirely obsolete. \n\nb . A notable advance in reducing drag and highlifts, wing load is evident in the “cleaned up” refinement in the \nextreme. The absence of riveting and surface over-lapping indicates a “simplistic” concept that confronts our \ntechnology to match the “careful and well-considered compromises in respect to weight, aerodynamic refinement, \nand design.” \n\nc. The designers have managed to offset Bernouilli’s theorem that allows the “total pressure in a flow ” to be less at all \npoints; we can liken this to the concept of ‘conservation of energy ’ and their negating friction losses, which would \ndissipate heat. \n\nd. The airfoil design of the circular wing is similar to the NACA 230 series with the exception to the wing plan form \nand thickness range requirements. The parasite drag appears to be controlled by the refinement of the design and \nelimination of protuberances. The induced drag lessens with the circular span inversely with the low aspect-ratio of \nthe wing. \n\ne. The fuselage/hull appears to fall into the seaplane type in concept by manifesting excellent hydrodynamic \ncharacteristics of low \n\n\n- 1 - \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\n“porpoising” tendencies. Conventional surface controls are absent in the wing and cabin portions of the recovered \nsections though what appears to be tabs or flaps are identified. Because there are no vertical or horizontal stabilizers \non the craft, there are no fore-and-aft positions of the wing relative to the fuselage/hull. Wing incidence seems to be \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npre-selected via an in-flight trim computer to reduce drag attitude when the wing is at the angle of attack required at \nhigh speed and provide stability to lift the weight of the craft. \n\nBasic Itr fr R&D, to CG, AMC, ATTN HQ, AAF, WASH.

A comparison of ADI HI 112 steels indicates that the metals used to \nconstruct the craft exceed structure, chemical composition and mechanical properties currently under \ndevelopment. Metal specimens were subjected to ADI S620, ADI 3140, ADI 4140, ADI E4340, ADI \n5149m AU3U 5640, ADI E 52100, and ADI 430, 410 and 347 machining tests with negative results. \n\n2. Craft designed, for high altitude flight. Automatic exhaust orifices were identified. A gyro-controlled wing \nstabilizer apparently maintains craft in a hover mode. \n\n3. Power plant may consist of a spherical reactor (hydrogen isotope type) connected to propulsion motors. \n\n4. 100 ft. in diameter with central section approximately 20 ft. Central cabin may have three flight decks: top \nlevel for flight control; central section for equipment and lower section for power plant and landing gear. \nCircular wing may have rotating section and adjustable leading edge. \n\n5. Top (Dome) may have the ability to recede into central section for high performance operations. Observation \nblisters are retract (sic) to provide observation top and bottom of wing. \n\n6. Construction is based on a 6:1 ratio. \n\n7. Flight instruments and controls are activated by optical wave guide fibers similar to glass rods except they \nare flexible and have a plastic cladding wrap. All functions may be operated by touch sensitive of texture \nsending stimuli. Instruments are covered by a plastic plate and seem to be color coded. \n\n8. Craft may have all weather navigation capability to allow ‘blind flying’. Possible television viewing used. \n\n- 2 - \n\n===========[END ]========== \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n\n1. Again, nothing in the document mentions the ET Hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the recovered vehicle, even \nthough, as indicated by the opening statement, the question of its origin is the very purpose originating the memo in the first \nplace: “As requested by your letter of 16 July 1947 this office has produced its conclusions on the manufacture, function and \npossible origin of the above referenced subject. ” Indeed, the document is quite clear in its conclusions that “some nation has \nreached a stage of flight development in which the present ideas are entirely obsolete.” If the ET Hypothesis were in view as \nan explanation of origins, this sentence would have been worded appropriately. And again, it is significant that something \nabout the technology suggested to the Air Force that German Paperclip personnel could shed some light on the subject. The \nGermans, as has been seen from the chapters in part one, had made great strides in high altitude high performance aircraft. \nThus, something about the technology looked “German. ” \n\n2. Thus, this tends in turn to corroborate the notion that at some higher level of the MJ-12 group a deliberate deep cover story of \nET origins is being put out in the documents themselves to conceal what is now becoming obvious: such high-altitude high \nperformance craft were the exotic purview and provenance of the highly classified experimental research being done by Nazi \nGermany, since it is the only nation on earth at that time to have possessed, developed, and tested such technology. Thus, the \nimplicit implication of this statement is that these projects were being carried forward after the war, independently or quasi- \nindependently, by some unknown entity and in some unknown location(s). \n\n3. The exact methods of this achievement are then clearly specified: “The designers have managed to offset Bemouilli’s \ntheorem that allows the “total pressure in a flow ” to be less at all points; we can like this to the concept of ‘conservation of \nenergy’ and their negating friction losses, which would dissipate heat. ” The mention of Bemouilli’s theorem suggests that \nthe aircraft was designed for high performance in the atmosphere, most likely in high altitude. Moreover, the brief and \nsuggestive mention of the conservation of energy and negation of friction losses also strongly suggests German research into \nsuctioning the boundary layer mentioned by Vesco and Childress in Man-Made UFOS, and even more suggestively, to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexperiments in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a revolutionary physics concept for that time. These theoretical indicators \nagain point clearly to developments in Nazi Germany, as it was again the only country to have undertaken such research. In \nthis regard, it is once again perhaps significant that the recovered craft was brought to Air Materials Command at Wright \nField, where a number of Paperclip scientists and technicians are known to have been employed at the time. This fact \nsuggests once again that something about the craft immediately suggested a German provenance to the American personnel \ninvolved in its recovery and analysis. \n\n4. The statement that “Wing incidence seems to be pre-selected via an in-flight trim computer to reduce drag attitude when the \nwing is at the angle of attack required at high speed and provide stability to lift the weight of the craft” mentions specifically \nan in flight computer. This fact may tend to contraindicate our thesis of continued independent Nazi development of such \ntechnologies. While it is true that both the Allies and Germans did develop early digital computers during the war, these were \nof such bulk and size that the complex calculations needed to perform trim computations would have been impractical on an \naircraft, even an unconventional one, unless the Germans had also incorporated their semiconductor technology in the \ndevelopment of much smaller computers for such purposes. While no evidence exists that this was ever done, the fact that \nboth computing and prototypical transistor technology were possessed by them during the war means that it merely remained \nto combine the two. As has been argued in Reich of the Black Sun, this combining of highly advanced technologies is a \nsignature and favored method of the Kammlerstab. And as was seen in chapter two, the Nazis had made great strides during \nthe war of miniaturizing television cameras for use in guided missiles. Nonetheless, this would have remained a bulky device, \nand accordingly, this piece of information argues more persuasively for an E.T. or other exotic origin. \n\n5. As noted, the “Craft (was) designed for high altitude flight. Automatic exhaust orifices were identified. A gyro-controlled \nwing stabilizer apparently maintains craft in a hover mode. ” The high altitude was again a characteristic of developments by \nDr. Lippisch, Dr. Sanger, and others during the war, and the mention of “exhaust orifices” tends to support the conclusion \nthat this is a suction or ramjet based craft of some sort. Note, however, that apparently the craft is capable of stationary \nhovering, a fact that would seem to preclude any conventional ramjet craft. \n\n6. The description of a spherical power plant based apparently on hydrogen fusion fits similar descriptions given in the “White \nHot Intelligence Estimate” and General Twining’s “Air Accident Report” as discussed in Reich of the Black Sun.— \n\n7. Note that “the circular wing may have (a) rotating section” or turbine of some sort. Again, this points to the researches of \nBellonzo (as reported by Vesco/Childress in Man-Made UFOs), Schauberger, Fleissner and others in the Third Reich. \n\n8. The “construction is based on a 6:1 ratio”, which is the same ratio as reported in the MJ-12 documents examined in Reich of \nthe Black Sun. This would tend to argue quite strongly for the fact that we are dealing with one and the same craft. \n\n9. Note that flight control appears to be based on “optical wave guide fibers similar to glass rods except they are flexible and \nhave a plastic cladding wrap, ” i.e., on fiber optics. Recall that Col. Corso also mentions this piece of technology as being \ndeliberately ET in origin, and recovered from Roswell. \n\n10. The same cannot be said, however, for the final statement: “Possible television viewing used. ” As has been seen, the \nGermans were greatly successful, largely due to their semiconductor achievements and ability to miniaturize klystron tubes, \nin miniaturizing television cameras to sufficiently small size and weight to be used as guidance systems on their lighter \nrockets such as the Tonne anti-aircraft missile. \n\n11. Finally and most significantly, it must be noted that this memorandum is addressed to Brigadier General C. P. (Charles \nPeare) Cabell, who later became Deputy Director of Central Intelligence under Allen Dulles, and who was fired by President \nKennedy ostensibly for his part in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It is also to be noted, as some JFK assassination researchers have \npointed out, that Cabell’s brother was mayor of Dallas during the assassination, and was instrumental in the last minute \nchange of the motorcade route to divert towards the Texas School Book Depository. We have then, with this document, a \nclear link from the UFO problem with all its “Nazi implications” as exhibited in the documents thus far examined, via Cabell, \nto the Kennedy assassination. Given that the origin of the craft in no wise is considered to be extra-terrestrial by the \ndocument, but rather to have originated with “some nation,” we may safely speculate that there is a “Nazi” aspect not only \nlurking in the background of the 1947 UFO flap, but in that of the JFK assassination as well. \n\nThis UFO-JFK assassination connection is “corroborated” in a letter from Timothy Cooper’s anonymous source almost immediately. \n\n\n3. Document 3: Letter of Source 1 to Timothy Cooper: \n\n\nReceived 6/30/99 \nIsl Timothy J Cooper \n\nCOPY \n\nFILE \n\n\nJune 23, 1999 \n\nMr. Timothy Cooper \n\nP. O. Box 1206 \n\nBig Bear Lake, CA 92315 \n\nMr. Cooper: \n\nI am a retired CIA counterintelligence officer who worked for Jim Angleton from \n\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????? secret files \n???????????????????? sensitive files that would connect MJ-12 to JFK’s murder. This document did not exist officially and has \nnever been disclosed within the agency. AWD was very fearful of disclosure to unauthorized channels and leaks in the White \nHouse. I literally snatched the “Directives” from the fire and have kept them safe from review. To allow a review would \ncompromise future directors and put the agency in a difficult position. \n\nI feel the time is fast approaching when the files of the Majestic/Jehovah project will be pried loose and the public’s right to \nknow should begin. We in Cl— have monitored civilian UFO research for a long time and have played a major role in keeping \nthe UFO community busy. ?????????????????? that the MJ-12 Directives be sent to you and hopefully, be disseminated in a \nresponsible manner. \n\nI think your decision to work with Dr. Wood was a good one. He has credibility and good science skills. I hope you have read \nthe BLUE BOOK/MAJIC report with an open mind and a critical eye for detail. This, you might say, is the missing BLUE \nBOOK files (don’t confuse these with Project BLUE BOOK). You need proof and here it is. I don’t think you realize it but \nyou and Dr. Wood have started a shit storm. Nixon’s SCEO ordered all MJ-12 documentation purged and destroyed. This one \nwas not. This carbon copy is the only link to MJ-12 and don’t expect any more in the future. Everything is now on computers \nand there is no existing paper trail to my knowledge. If you play your cards right, you should make progress with what you \nhave. I caution you to be careful about who you talk to and trust with this information. \n\nFILE \n\n\nP.S. Not everyone has good intentions watch your ass \n\n\n[ENDj \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n\nWhat concerns us here is the brief statement toward the beginning of the document: “secret files ???????????????????? sensitive files \nthat would connect MJ-12 to JFK’s murder.” We have seen in the analysis of the previous document that a clear connection exists \nbetween the UFO recovery program and the JFK assassination, via the memo to Brigadier General C. A. Cabell. This is \ncorroborated by Cooper’s anonymous source, who goes a step further by implying the existence of files connecting MJ-12 itself to \nthe assassination. The implication is that, at its highest level, the MAJIC - 12 operation is its ultimate motivation, behind and higher \nthan, but not in contradiction with, the other lesser motives advanced in JFK assassination literature, e.g., Mafia revenge, CIA \nrevenge, and so on. This is further corroborated and expanded upon by Cooper’s “source” in a second letter a few days later: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Document 4: Letter of Anonymous Source to Timothy Cooper Concerning Privatization of MJ-12: \n\n\nReceived 7/9/99 IMPORTANT July 7, \n1999 \n\nTimothy J Cooper \n\n\nPlease read everything I am about to tell you as the truth. I am not a prankster or a wacko. My reason for typing this letter is to \ngive you the facts as I know them. I am what is called in spy jargon a “walk in.” I became such in 1982 when I learned about \nBill Moore and his “aviary” sources who were really OSI agents. Unlike yourself and others, Moore was taken in by the \ndeception about Majestic Twelve and EBE’s. He was promised “inside” information regarding the Roswell case. From what I \nknow about Moore and his desire to be on the “inside” led him to hoax some documents based on material supplied to him by \nOSI. I think he was so taken in by the material that he believed it himself and went off the deep end. You seemed by what I \nhave been told and what I have read about you on the internet to be a level-headed guy with some real backing and good \ninformation on the UFO issue. You may not know now, but you have some really important stuff that is creating a lot of tension \nin the UFO community. If you don’t, you have better appreciate it. You have been given information that no one has. To make \nmy point a little more clearer, remember a few years back when you got the JFK memo William Colby got fingered in it and \nsomeone decided to shut him up before he was questioned about it. Coincidence? No way! He was not the first to be eliminated \nand won’t be the last I assure you. You have been left alone for the most part I think because you are a nobody in the UFO \ncommunity and have no credibility with them and that is good. I think “they” wanted it this way. Being a high profile \npersonality is not always a good thing. Look how STF — got put on the “watch list” by the OSI. \n\nToo high of a profile and too vocal with national identity. Linda Howe is another example. \n\nIMPORTANT \n\n=======[PAGE B RE AK]======== \n\n-2-IMPORT ANT \n\nWhen high profile individuals begin making waves with allegations and hard proof they put themselves in very difficult situations in \nwhich they have to defend constantly. The demise of several key personalities in just the last five years should tell you something. \n\nNow, I want to fill you in on some things regarding the specific studies and conclusions by the defunct MJ-12 group. \n\na. MJ-12 does not exist as a government intelligence entity. It ceased to exist in 1969 and became a private concern financed by \nbig money and big science. \n\nb. The group has been called by many names. The most recent one was used in 1992 and was identified by the name \nJEHOVAH. At one time it was called ZODIAC and may have changed in 1995. \n\nc. The UFO/EBE Working Group is an international consortium financed and supported by some of the biggest money \ninstitutions and private industrialists in the world \n\nd. MJ-12 was a consolidation of two Pentagon projects MAJESTIC and JEHOVAH overseen by a group of twelve high level \nmilitary, intelligence, and scientific institutions within the defense establishment hence MJ-12. Each code name had \nclassification above TOP SECRET and fell into a classification called MOST SECRET. \n\ne. JEHOVAH was a DoD project to back engineer the hardware research the physics. Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer was \n\nappointed by Dr. Bush to head this project. The project name was coined by Albert Einstein in 1949. Oppenheimer held this \njob until 1953 until the AEC no longer considered him reliable and had his security clearance taken away and lost his \ngovernment job in 1954. \n\nf. Einstein became unreliable in 1955 and died of “cancer ”. \n\ng. Oppenheimer continued as a MJ-12 2 player until his death from “cancer. ” \n\nh. In 1960 MJ-12 concluded that UFOs were a possible threat to U.S. defenses and could instigate mass paranoia. They also \nconcluded that the EBEs could gain control of U.S. defenses \n\nIMPORTANT \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-3-IMPORTANT \n\nduring a nuclear crisis by interfering with the guidance and targeting computers of the Atlas ICBMs based in Turkey. \n\nj. In 1960, President Eisenhower approved a joint defense plan written by MJ-12 that in the event the U.S. came under a nuclear \n\nattack by the USSR through EBE deception the U.S. would not retaliate with proposed USAF SIOP— and only after \nconfirmation of UFO misidentification launch surgical strikes on the USSR. The purpose of the strikes was to take out USSR \ncommand and control infrastructure preventing an all out nuclear war. \n\nk. During the Cuban Missile Crisis President Kennedy was briefed by MJ- 12 and was told that the EBE deception was the \nreason the Soviets wanted to place first strike nuclear weapons in Cuba and he therefore restricted U.S. nuclear forces from \ninitiating the GRAND TOUR to bomber strikes. General Lemay was so furious with JFK that he secretly gave orders to \nSAC to go ahead with SIOP in the event the U.S. perceived a first strike warning from Russia. \n\nl. In 1963, JFK sought to ease the uneasy tension by extending cooperation with the USSR in outer space investigation or \nUFOs through a joint moon project. MJ-12 was opposed to this because they felt the militarization of the moon would place \nthe U.S. in a dangerous situation with the EBEs who control the dark side of the moon. \n\nm. In 1964, President Johnson was briefed by MJ-12 on the dangerous relationship with EBEs’ and how they influenced the \ndoctrines and policies of U.S. foreign relations. MJ-12 successfully prevented NICAP representatives from issuing their \nconclusions on UFOs to government leaders and blocked attempts by NICAP to brief Johnson on the UFO threat. MJ-12 \nwas responsible for this coup. n. In 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on all aspects of UFO activity and the \nEBE problem since 1947. Fearing possible leaks within his NSC and national security advisor Kissinger, Nixon \napproved a Special Classified Executive Order that required the U.S. intelligence community to purge all references to \nMJ-12 in their UFO files and to destroy documents that could connect him to JFK’s assassination by MJ-72. As Vice \nPresident, Nixon approved ZR RIFLE written by the 40 Committee (MJ-1 issued new directives that sanctioned JFK’s \nmurder) for political assassination operations. \n\no. After the press learned of the Watergate break in and theft of documents that could link MJ-12 to the 40 Committee, MJ-12 \narranged for Nixon’s exposure to ZR RIFLE and blackmailed him which led to his resignation. \n\np. MJ-12 arranged for the removal of FBI DIRECTOR J. Edgar Hoover in 1972 through “natural causes” because he “knew \ntoo much” and had used his contract killers to eliminate unrealiable individuals who could expose MJ-12’s existence and \nactivities \n\n\nIMPORTANT \n\n[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\n\nIMPORTANT \n\nMr. Cooper, I could go on and on but I think you get the gist of it. I cannot verify everything I have written here but with a little \nreading and research I think you can judge for yourself whether all this is true or not. Consider the JFK murder for example. \nEveryone believes he was a victim of a “lone nut” assassin as the Warren Commission Report said (which by the way was pure \nfiction). It was not the Cuban problem or the Cubans. Cuba was a screen to keep civilian researchers and the Congress away from \nthe true motive for his death. Simply put, Kennedy would have interfered with MJ- 12’s effort to come up with a defense and a \nplausible explanation to the UFO/EBE problem and was too sensitive an issue for interruption even by a president. Everyone \nbelieves that a president is in charge of his own office. That is simply NOT TRUE! Presidents can be and are compromised about \nissues they don’t need to know of. The reason is a simple one. It gives them plausible deniability just like CIA directors who are \noften asked this question: ‘What do we know about UFOs?’ Once exposed to the data they are changed and are stuck with this \nproblem: ‘What do I tell the President?’ You can’t tell the President without telling others. There is no such thing as a secret in the \nWhite House. Just look at the China espionage case. Until he really needs to know nothing will be told him and that is that. This is \nthe real dilemma for those in “the know” because the EMEs (extraterrestrial materialized entities) have complete control over UFOs \n(not to be confused with man-made UAVs often mistaken for UFOs for they have been around since the 1950s and are operated and \ncontrolled by the USAF, CIA and NRO) and can appear anywhere as anything at any time. Do you understand now? The \nintelligence behind true UFO sighting cases can materialize and ???????? \n\nIMPORTANT \n\n\n[PAGE BREAK] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-5-IMPORTANT \n\nappear at will to anyone at anytime any place. Why do you think the Air Force wanted Project Blue Book terminated? Because they \ncould not explain them in conventional terms without being laughed at by scientists. After 12,000 cases they had all the evidence \nthey needed and handed it over to the CIA and NSA. Was it mere coincidence that Blue Book was terminated after Apollo 11 \nlanded on the moon? And, do you think it was mere coincidence that the Dead Sea Scrolls appeared about the same time the UFOs \nwere found in New Mexico? Everything associated with UFOs has a purpose and so far, no one has figured it out yet. The \nappearance of UFOs in our century is no accident. Why do you think the other project was called JEHOVAH? Put the two together \nand see for yourself. It is SPIRITUAL! MJ-12 did and it scared the shit out of them. The 12 Apostles and the 12 created in 1947. \nOne is an antitypical reflection of the other except the antitypical 12 are not spiritual men and couldn’t grasp the significance and \nimport of what was happening on the world scene. I know this sounds crazy and unbelievable but it is true, believe me. I have it \nfrom reliable sources that the CIA used Jacques Vallee’s books as a guide for interpreting the human response to the UFO contact \nproblem and I suggest you do the same. He is studied at the CIA and NSA and is quoted in their literature. One thing that you \nshould concern yourself with and that is the possible undercurrent of image and character assassination that may be used against you \nif you are taken too seriously by the media and the press. Unless you have strong backing by the responsible members of the UFO \n\nIMPORTANT \n\n=========[PAGE BREAK]========= \n\n-6- IMPORTANT \n\nand the media you could end up like some others who have tried to use this knowledge for their own personal gain. I also caution \nyou about the severe psychological and spiritual affects from UFO investigations. Some well known researchers have suffered \npersonal identity questions and loss of close family ties and even faith itself. Don’t let this happen to you. You have to maintain a \nbalance and perspective when investigating this phenomenon. Some have lost all sense of reality and have suffered insanity as a \nresult. I wouldn’t recommend getting involved in remote viewing for a solution. The EMEs are not to be believed and are quite \ndeceptive. I’ll let you in on one secret that MJ-12 found early on. The earth ’s environment has undergone significant changes and \nare part of the ENVIRONMENT! The redacted portion of the librarys (??) book found in New Mexico predicts a world wide \ninvasion of EMEs in the year 2030 according to the lunar calendar which commences sometime after 1999. The CIA has \nundertaken a survey project called ENVIRONMENT through a joint CIACIVILIAN project called MEDEA to look at what \ndamage has been caused by EME controlled UFO activity especially around nuclear power plants and industrial waste production. \nFrom what I know the earth’s population is being contaminated and our DNA is being altered through pollution or our air, food \nsupply, and water. The digital Trojan Horse is going to wreck havoc soon and we have the EMEs to blame (not really, the army is \nresponsible for that one). To reduce it in a few words. WE ARE CATTLE AND SUBJECT TO SLAUGHTER BY EMEs. That is the \nGAME PLAN. The “insiders” know this and are taking advantage of the situation. Our only hope may come from extraterrestrial \nintervention. The world leaders see no viable solution except \n\nIMPORTANT \n\n\n[PAGE BREAK} \n\n\nIMPORT ANT-7- \n\npopulation control through biological warfare and regional conflicts. If UFOs trigger a nuclear exchange lets say between India and \nPakistan, or between China and Japan, or North and South Korea, or between Israel and Iraq, the NATO countries will surely take \nadvantage and try to finish them off. Keep an eye on Russia and China. They may start something along these lines and try to draw \nthe U.S. into it. In order to justify this kind of population control they may invent a crisis from outer space. They may try to convince \nthe world that extraterrestrials may invade our planet and eliminate the human race and therefore they need to deploy their space \ndefenses and kill a number of people in the process. Already there are events taking place all over the U. S. and in other countries \nthat are UFO related that bear this out. We are being inoculated for possible biological warfare and at the same time being \nconditioned (programmed) for extraterrestrial contact. This was and still is the agenda of secret government preparations. They \nknow it is coming but don’t know when and how. \n\n\nI hope you don’t take all this as the rantings of a raging lunatic. What I have written is based on what I have learned over the years \nand my association with the intelligence community who is equally in the dark as to the ultimate conclusion. I have included some \ngoodies for you which you might find helpful. Lot’s of luck to you and keep plugging away. The answer may be a simple one. \n\n\nIMPORTANT \n\n\n[END ]: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\nThis document contains a number of unsubstantiated assertions regarding MJ-12 and the nature of its ongoing operations, not the \nleast of which is again its willingness to commit murder to maintain its deep secrecy and covert development of “recovered \ntechnology”: \n\n1. Former CIA director William Colby is allegedly murdered because of his implication by name in MJ-12 documents linked to \nthe JFK assassination (“you may not know now, but you have some really important stuff that is creating a lot of tension in \nthe UFO community. If you don’t, you have better appreciate it. You have been given information that no one has. To make \nmy point a little more clearer, remember a few years back when you got the JFK memo William Colby got fingered in it and \nsomeone decided to shut him up before he was questioned about it. Coincidence? No way! He was not the fi.st to be \neliminated and won’t be the last I assure you. ”) \n\n2. MJ-12 appears to have been privatized by President Nixon, in part as a measure to insulate him from being implicated in \ninvolvement with the assassination, but, reading between the lines, also in part as a wider attempt to provide completely black \ncover to MJ-12 and independent sources of funding. Put differently, Cooper’s anonymous source alleges a fantastic thing: \nMJ-12 has grown so powerful it no longer falls under the control of the American government, but has become a private and \ninternational concern in its own right, with deep corporate pockets. This is elaborated in three discrete statements by the \nsource: \n\na. “MJ-12 does not exist as a government intelligence entity. It ceased to exist in 1969 and became a private concern \nfinanced by big money and big science. ” \n\nb. “The UFO/EBE Working Group is an international consortium financed and supported by some of the biggest \nmoney institutions and private industrialists in the world. ” \n\nc. “In 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on all aspects of UFO activity and the EBE problem since 1947. \nFearing possible leaks within his NSC and national security advisor Kissinger, Nixon approved a Special Classified \nExecutive Order that required the U.S. intelligence community to purge all references to MJ-12 in their UFO files \nand to destroy documents that could connect him to JFK’s assassination by MJ-12. As Vice President, Nixon \napproved ZR RIFLE written by the 40 Committee (MJ-1 issued new directives that sanctioned JFK’s murder) for \npolitical assassination operations. ” \n\nd. These points suggest an independent and very secret development of advanced technologies. Notably the date was \n1969, the same year as the first Apollo moon landings. One might therefore speculate on the following scenario: \nGehlen, Von Braun, and scores of Nazi scientists and intelligence agents struck their famous “bargain” with the \nAmerican military-industrial-national security complex, and in return, continued not only to pursue their projects, but \nto penetrate sensitive areas of the very government that presumed to control them, giving them a measure of “semi¬ \nindependence.” In 1969 their influence had grown so powerful, perhaps, that the relationship was severed, and \nMAJIC-12 became totally independent, perhaps merged into some “Nazi International” with deep corporate pockets. \n\n3. Einstein and Oppenheimer were allegedly murdered by MJ- 12 by being “given cancer” when they became “unreliable”, \npresumably meaning no longer in sympathy with the goals or methods of the MJ-12 group. It is significant perhaps that Jack \nRuby, the assassin of the alleged assassin of JFK, claimed that he was being “murdered by cancer” injections to silence him. \n\n4. The Apollo Moon program apparently has some connection with a plan not only to militarize the moon jointly with the \nRussians,— but also is a program specifically designed at its heart - though the purpose remains secret - to investigate UFOs: \n“In 1963, JFK sought to ease the uneasy tension by extending cooperation with the USSR in outer space investigation oj \nUFOs through a joint moon project. MJ-12 was opposed to this because they felt the militarization of the moon would place \nthe U.S. in a dangerous situation with the EBEs who control the dark side of the moon. ” In other words, the document gives \nits own version of the Two Space Programs hypothesis. \n\n5. Kennedy was assassinated for attempted interference with the plans and goals of the MJ-12 group: “Simply put, Kennedy \nwould have interfered with MJ-12’s effort to come up with a defense and a plausible explanation to the UFO/EBE problem \nand was too sensitive an issue for interruption even by a president. ” \n\n6. The crash and recovery of a craft in Roswell in 1947 and the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is not coincidental, implying \nthat there is a spiritual dimension to the problem. Moreover, the cancellation of Blue Book after Apollo 11 landed is \nconnected: “Was it mere coincidence that Blue Book was terminated after Apollo 11 landed on the moon? And, do you think \nit was mere coincidence that the Dead Sea Scrolls appeared about the same time the UFOs were found in New Mexico?” \nThe implication is similar to my analysis in Reich of the Black Sun that the Byrd Highjump Expedition to Antarctica and the \nsubsequent allegations he made in the Chilean press are connected to the events at Roswell and to the murder of Secretary of \n\n\nWar James Forrestal. Cooper’s source is, moreover, suggesting a “spiritual” dimension by connecting the Dead Sea Scrolls to \nall of this.— \n\n7. Cooper’s source alleges that the portion of the recovered “leaf book” that is blacked out in the publicly received version of \nthe “White Hot Intelligence Estimate”— contains information concerning the planned invasion and slaughter of humanity by \nEBEs in 2030: “I’ll let you in on one secret that MJ-12 found early on. The earth ’s environment has undergone significant \nchanges and are part of the ENVIRONMENT! The redacted portion of the library — (??) book found in New Mexico \npredicts a world wide invasion ofEMEs in the year 2030 according to the lunar calendar which commences sometime after \n1999. ” \n\n8. Of interest is the coincidence of this genocidal agenda with Hitler’s own genocidal plans for the world had he succeeded in \nconquering it: “To reduce it in a few words, WE ARE CATTLE AND SUBJECT TO SLAUGHTER BY EMEs. That is the \nGAME PLAN. ” Thus, even ideologically there appears to be a connection to Nazism, and likewise, to the “spiritual” aspect \nalleged by Cooper’s source. This “globalcidal” agenda appears, however, to be the result of a planned deception of \nhumanity: “In order to justify this kind of population control they may invent a crisis from outer space. They may try to \nconvince the world that extraterrestrials may invade our planet and eliminate the human race and therefore they need to \ndeploy their space defenses and kill a number of people in the process. ” This squares exactly with Von Braun’s warning to \nDr. Carol Rosin, as recorded in her affidavit and cited in Reich of the Black Sun.— In other words, the source’s remarks may \npoint to the survival and “internationalization and privatization” of the Nazi death cult via the privatization and \ninternationalization of MJ-12 itself. \n\n\n5.

As a result of the Twining Report, the President was compelled to sign into law the National Security Act of 1947 which \ncame into effect in 19 September.

While distasteful ???????????????????????t times, the use of \n???????????????????? measures have been executed. The untimely death of Secretary Forrestal, was deemed necessary and \ninevitable.” This calls for some speculation. Assuming that the relationship between Operation Highjump, possible (though \nimprobable) Nazi survival in the Antarctic, and the Roswell crash and recovery are all related, might Forrestal have been privy to the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeep cover “ET hypothesis” disinformation plans of MJ-12 and objected to them? Might he therefore have been considered \n“unreliable” or a risk to the long term, and apparently “globalcidal” goals of the group, as alleged by Cooper’s source? If so, he \nwould have been eliminated. Equally, if some rapprochement was struck between MJ-12 on behalf of the US Government and any \nindependently surviving group of Nazis, and had Forrestal known of it, he most likely would have registered severe objections, and \nagain been eliminated. We will most likely never know for certain, but the possibilities bear mentioning. \n\n\n\n7.

Consultation with Dr. Bush and other scientists on the issue of finding practical uses for the atomic secrets learned from \nstudy of celestial devices precludes any further discussion and I therefore authorize Dr. Bush to proceed with the project without \nfurther delay. This information is vital to the nation’s superiority and must remain within the confines of state secrets. Any further \ndiscussion on the matter will be restricted to General Donovan, Dr. Bush, the Secretary of War and yourself. The challenge our \nnation faces is daunting and perilous in this undertaking and I have committed the resources of the government towards that end. \nYou have my assurance that when circumstances are favorable and we are victorious, the Army will have the fmits of research in \nexploring further applications of this new wonder. \n\nYou may speak to me about this if the above is not wholly clear. \n\nF.

I also agree that application of non-terrestrial know how in atomic energy must be \nused in perfecting super weapons of war to affect the complete defeat of Germany and Japan. In view of the cost already incurred in \nthe atomic bomb program, it would, at this time, be difficult to approve without further support of the Treasury Department and the \nmilitary. I therefore have decided to forego such a enterprise. From the point of view of the informed members of the United States, \nour principle object is not to engage in exploratory research of this kind but to win the war as soon as possible. \n\nVarious points have been raised about the difficulties such an endeavor would pose to the already hardened research for advanced \nweapons programs and support groups in our war effort and I agree that now is not the time. It is my personal judgement that, when \nthe war is won, and peace is once again restored, there will come a time when surplus funds may be available to pursue a program \ndevoted to understanding non-terrestrial science and its technology which is still greatly undiscovered. I have had private discussions \nwith Dr. Bush on this subject and the advice of several eminent scientists who believe the United States should take every advantage \nof such wonders thut have come to us. I have heard the arguments of General Marshall and other members of the military that the \nUnited States must assume its destiny in this matter for the sake of the Nation’s security in the post-war world and I have given \nassurances that such will be the case. \n\n\nI appreciate the effort and time spent in producing valuable insights into the proposal to find ways of advancing our technology \nand national progress and in coming to grips with the reality that our planet is not the only one harboring intelligent life in the \nuniverse. I also commend the committee for the organization and planning that is evident in Dr. Bush’s proposal and the delicate \nway in which it was presented. I trust the committee will appreciate the situation on which this office must render its decision. \n\nFranklinDRoosevelt \n\n\nDOUBFE TOP SECRET \nDOUBLE TOP SECRET \n=========[END DOCUMENT) \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n\nFrom the foregoing alleged letters to Secretary of War General Marshall from President Franklin Roosevelt, we are in a position to \ndraw some tentative conclusions: \n\n\n1. The US retrieved craft with extraordinary technology earlier than Roswell, ca. 1941-42, most likely the alleged Cape \nGirardeau and Louisiana crashes noted previously. Given that the Nazi projects are at this time nowhere near the degree of \nprogress they would be by the end of the war and after, we may reasonably assume that these recovered aircraft do not \noriginate there. \n\n2. Two conclusions follow from this: \n\n\na. Given allegations of similar crashes in Fascist Italy ca 1933 and Nazi Germany ca 1936 as recounted in Reich of the \nBlack Sun and elsewhere, it is possible that the US, Italy and Germany were all in the possession of extraterrestrial \ntechnology which each nation began to back-engineer. This would square with some interpretations of the off-the- \nrecord remarks made by Von Braun and Von Karmann to Twining as recorded by Col. Corso and mentioned later in \nthis chapter and in Reich of the Black Sun.— An important question thus ensues: Why were these nations in \npossession of recovered craft? It is peculiar that it appears that these three major combatants alone were in possession \nof this technology. It should be noted that the alleged Italian and German crashes occurred prior to the announcement \nof nuclear fission’s discovery by Otto Hahn in 1938, thus making it possible that this research itself was part of the \nprocess of back engineering. Given also that it appears from the data presented in Reich of the Black Sun that \nGermany was enriching uranium on a massive scale ca. as early as 1940, this may be a possible explanation. \n\nb. The alternative explanation is that the crash and recovered vehicle themselves are not extra-terrestrial, but stem from \nsome independent terrestrially based group pursuing its own technological developments and that these vehicles \ncrashed and were recovered by the Germans, Italians, and Americans. They may represent therefore a continuation of \nthe 1890s “Air Ship Mystery”. — In support of this contention the following MJ-12 document should be noted: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Document 9: Recovered, Reconstructed, and Test-Flown “S” Aircrati and Paper Clip Assistance: \n\n\n4-15 \n\nTHE “LOANED” AIRCRAFT WAS ACQUIRED IN 1945 FROM THE AIR TECHNICAL SERVICES COMMAND (ATSC. NOW \nAEDC, AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND). THE “S” AIRCRAFT WAS WAS(SIC) DESIGNED FROM A AERODYNE \nRECOVERED IN 1942 IN LOU SIAN A. RECONSTRUCTION COMMENCED IN 1945 WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GERMAN \nSCIENTISTS AT WRIGHT FIELD. PROPULSION PROGRAMS TRIED TO DUPLICATE THE ATOMIC POWER PLANT \nFOUND ON THE AERODYNE CAPTURED IN LOUSIANA AND INTEGRATED THE MAGNETIC DRIVE SYSTEM \nDEVELOPED BY TESLA. THE AAF HOPED TO INTRODUCE THIS CRAFT IN WAR, BUT RESOURCES AND MONEY \nWAS NOT AVAILABLE. FUNDING WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO R&D UNTIL 1946, WHEN LEMAY TOOK OVER \nTHE PROJECT. THE S CRAFT COULD TAKE OFF VERTCALLY (SIC) AND REACH ALTITUDES AS HIGH AS 90.000 \nFEET AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS. THE CONTROLS WERE ELECTRONIC FLY BY WIRE AND THE PILOT LOOKED \nAT PROJECTION OF SYMBOLS ON A TRANSARENT SCREEN. THE CRAFT WAS SO COMPLICATED THAT TEST \nPILOTS HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN HIGH PERFORMANCE AT VERY HIGH ALTITUDES. SEVERAL TEST PILOTS \nWERE KILLED AS A RESULT OF DECOMPRESSION AND EJECTION. CAPSULE OR ESCAPE CYLINDERS WERE NOT \nDESIGNED FOR HIGH ALTITUDE EJECTIONS. AS A RESULT, ONE “S” CRAFT WAS LOST. THE MATERIALS USED \nIN THE CONSTRUCTION BY HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY FAILED TO PROTECT THE TEST PILOTS IN \nMAXIMUM THROTTLE SETTINGS AND EXPOSED THEM TO HIGH DOSE OF RADIATION WHICH RESULTED IN \nSERIOUS ILLNESS AND DEATH. TEST FLIGHTS CONTINUED OVER THE WSPG IN EARLY 1947 AT KIRTLAND \nAAF, AND AT ALAMOGORDO AAF TULAROSA RANGE WITH BETTER RESULTS TO FLIGHT PERFORMANCE. \nBUT EXPOSURE TO THE RADIATION FROM THE ATOMIC ENGINE CONTINUED. IN 1947, THE “S” CRAFT WAS \nMODIFIED TO CARRY ATOMIC WEAPONS OVER LONG DISTANCES. BUT HIGH ALTITUDE FLIGHT SIMULATIONS \nAND PILOT SURVIBAILITY WAS STILL A PROBLEM. BELL AIRCRAFT WAS GIVEN THE CONTRACT FOR A \nROCKET-POWERED AIRCRAFT TEST BED TO RECORD FLIGHT DATA AT SUPERSONIC SPEEDS AS A \nPROBLEM SOLVING LABORATORY. DATA COLLECTED FROM X-l AIRCRAFT WAS UTILIZED FOR DESIGN \nMODIFICATION OF “S” CRAFT AERODYNAMIC TESTS AND LANGELY. RADIATION PROBLEMS PROMPTED A \nCHANGE IN THINKING IN THE TEST PILOT PROGRAM PROMPTED A NEW PILOT “MODEL” EXPERIMENT \nUSING ALTERNATE CHOICE OF SUBJECTS AND SERVICES, AND WAS GIVEN SPECIAL STATUS EQUAL TO THE \nSECURITY OF THE ATOMIC BOMB PROGRAM. AT LEAST A DOZEN “S” CRAFT WERE BUILT AND TEST FLOWN. \nTHREE WERE LOST DUE TO MECHANICAL FAILURE AND PILOT ERROR. TWO MORE “S” CRAFT WERE LOST \nALONG WITH FIVE FATALITIES, THAT CAUSED THE AAF TO CANCEL THE PROJECT INDEFINITELY. ALL \nSIMILAR “WING” AIRCRAFT PROJECTED FOR SERVICE IN AAF WERE LIKEWISE CANCELLED IN 1949 AT THE \nRECOMMENDATION OF GENERAL LEMAY. FUTURE ATOMIC-POWERED AIRCRAFT WERE “PILOTLESS” AND \nWOULD BE CONTROLLED REMOTELY. THE AF WOULD NOT RESUME TESTING OF “LOANED” AERODYNES \nUNTIL PILOT SAFETY ISSUES WERE SATISFIED AND A MORE SECURE TEST RANGE COULD BE USED FOR \nAEROSPACE R&D PROGRAMS. AREA 51 IS BUT ONE SUCH RANGE AMONG THE SECRET TEST SITES NOW IN \nOPERATION. A SPECIAL RECOVERY AND SECURITY UNIT CALLED S.T.U.D.S., WAS CREATED IN THE LATE \n1980’S TO FACILITATE THE SERVICING OF NEWER “S” CRAFT FLIGHT TEST OPERATIONS. EFFORTS TO \nCONCEAL THE TRUE NATURE OF FLIGHT OPERATIONS WERE-SUCCESSFUL IN THAT THE AF DEVISED A COVER \nINTELLIGENCE PROJECT CALLED BLUE BOOK. PROJECT BLUE BOOK. AS A COVER PROHECT, WAS \nCONTROLLED BY THE C1.9 TO PROTECT AF TEST FLIGHT OPERATIONS FROM SPECULATION BY THE PUBLIC. \nAND CONVINCE THE SOVIETS THAT USAF HAD NO AIRCRAFT CAPABLE OF FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND \nMANEUVERS AS OBSERVED AND REPORTED TO BLUE BOOK AND THE USAF UFO PROGRAM.

Note that the “S” craft was allegedly a design based on the wartime Louisiana recovery, done with the assistance of the \nPaper Clip scientists, implying that their special expertise was needed in order to bring the project to completion (“The \n‘loaned aircraft’ was acquired in 1945 from the Air Technical Services Command (ATSC, now AEDC, Air Force Systems \nCommand). The “S” aircraft was was (sic) designed from a aerodyne (sic) recovered in 1942 in Lousiana(sic). \nReconstruction commenced in 1945 with the assistance of German scientists at Wright Field.” \n\n2. Note also that the propulsion unit is both atomic and magnetic - like the Bell - and has some connection to Tesla, implying a \nkind of field propulsion. (“Propulsion programs tried to duplicate the atomic power plant found on the aerodyne captured in \nLousiana (sic) and integrated the magnetic drive system developed by Tesla.”) These statements corroborate William Lyne’s \nversion of the Two Space Programs Hypothesis, with his peculiar reliance on Tesla’s ideas. \n\n3. Note that the “S” aircraft lacks an adequate ejection mechanism for ejection at high altitudes and/or high performance, a \nproblem specifically solved by wartime Nazi research in conjunction with their own research into high altitude high \nperformance ramjet aircraft. The report mentions the building of 12 “S” aircraft. \n\n4. The craft were developed to carry and deploy atomic weapons remotely. \n\n5. Finally and most importantly, the Air Force apparently developed Blue Book as a deep cover story to cloak the development \nof these craft and conceal their extraordinary flight characteristics behind the ET Myth as a disinformation operation designed \nto persuade the Soviets that the US had no such technological capability. This suggests that the nature of the recovered craft \nin Missouri in 1941 and Louisiana in 1942 were of extraordinary, though terrestrial and unknown, origin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9: Document 10: Edward Teller’s Pitch to president Reason for SDI: \n\n\nRECEIVED \n1 2 TJC \n3-1 \n\n\nEdward Teller’s pitch to President Reagan for SDI \n\nI wish to bring to your attention of a very real(sic) and dangerous situation that threatens not only us, the world, but our very \nexistence, as a race. For over forty years I have been involved in developing advanced technologies in the defense of this country \nwhich would insure our security, freedom, and our form of government from surprise attack. As you must be aware, the Defense \nDepartment has initiated several space defense programs of vast proportions and at great expense. But there is a new and alarming \ndevelopment of which I am compelled to inform you of(sic). A menace greater that the nuclear arms race exists. It does not \noriginate here on earth but comes from space itself. The agent of mass destruction has no reasoning psychology other than the \nultimate destruction of our civilization and our way of life as we know it. \n\nObtaining critical information of this menace has been hard and time consuming and the facts seem to he tangled among dark \nthreats of ultimate destruction; our innate fear of the unknown has interfered with our ability to comprehend it. A space attack could \nbe real in the near future bringing with it the truth that by our inaction global war could be immensely accelerated. No longer can the \nUnited States be in the position which it found itself in 1947. This was realized and in January 1950 President Truman made the \ndecision to go ahead with a defense program exceeding in scope and cost of the Manhattan Project. Late in president Eisenhower’s \noffice, several attempts \n\n==========[PAGE BREAK 1========== \n\n\n- 2 - \n\nwas (sic) made to limit further development by prohibiting the testing of space defense weapons. A moratorium was entered into, a \n“gentlemen’s agreement” whereby Russia and the United States concurred that testing be halted until further notice. \n\nUnfortunately, secrecy and denial has prevented further work of which I now propose. A more detailed proposal is difficult to \naddress in my brief, especially since I want it to be realistic and acceptable. Yet such a proposal is made here, both to give warning \nof what could happen and to begin a concrete discussion on the Space Defense Initiative program. The Defense Department could \ncontinue “classification” of critically key information of knowledge collected in 1947 and, therefore, its secrecy in its present form. \nOnly a small number of documents might need to be kept secret for a longer period, but in those cases a few highly responsible \npersons would have to certify, year by year, that continued secrecy be maintained. What I wish to impress upon you is the need for \nabsolute secrecy for the real reasons for a space defense. The real danger is the existence of secrecy can not be kept secret for ever. \nOur scientists will not turn to national defense unless they perceive an actual danger to the United States. A danger was perceived in \n1939, only two years before Pearl Harbor. It is vital to the program that scientists should perceive the danger now, before it is too \nlate. What is at stake is not only the prevention of defeat, but the prevention of cosmic war. Nevertheless, convincing the American \npeople that military research is necessary is a difficult thing. \n\n==========[PAGE BREAK 1========== \n\n\n-3- \n\nI am not speaking of another arms race, but rather a race of technology. One individual familiar with military technology and \nengineering of special intelligence, Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., estimates that in 1960 the United States and the USSR spent equal \npercentages of their military budgets on space defense and research and development, while in 1974 that percentage was three times \nas high in Russia as in the United States. The quality of future space defense weapons depends more on research and development \nthan on any other factor; the obvious recommendation is that we should spend more on it. Today we spend approximately 10 \npercent, so this recommendation does not seem too difficult to implement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace defense plays important roles in military affairs, particularly in communications and intelligence gathering. Both of these \nfunctions apt to become increasingly important in the future. An extension of our information gathering, including continuous \nsurveillance of deep space, should have high priority. This could be done in two ways. One is to increase our ability to launch \nsatellites of all needed varieties within a short time. The other is to provide decoys in space, thereby multiplying the number of \ntargets the enemy would have to knock out. A combination of these two procedures could, indeed, avert the enemy from taking out \nall our space vehicles. A third possibility is to prepare retaliation against the enemy by destroying their space vehicles. But, at least \nin regard to the important item of information gathering, the enemy relies on stealth more than their spacecraft than we do; therefore \nemphasis on the first two \n\n==========[PAGE B RE AK]========== \n\n\n-4- \n\ntwo (sic) approaches is recommended. In preparing decoys for space vehicles, the main objective would be for decoys to look like \nspace vehicles that function like real ones. One the whole, this is not too difficult. Usually the main problem with a decoy is its mass. \nIn order for a decoy to be inexpensive it must be light, but usually the light weight gives it away - for instance, in meeting air \nresistance, a lighter vehicle is more easily slowed down. Exceedingly little air resistance is encountered by space vehicles. Therefore, \nlightweight decoys for space vehicles are more feasible than decoys for almost any other application. \n\nRemotely piloted vehicles (RPV s) have been developed and tested with marginal success. The possibility of RPV s exist for the \nenemy as well for us. The use of RPVs was first explored by the U.S. Air Force. It can also be applied to small space objects. An \ningenious new circular airfoil design is now in experimental stage. A single wing is used in this design. Another design is also under \ndevelopment. This one uses a single wing as well, pivoting at its center at the fuselage. The wing is at right angles to the plane at \ntakeoffand landing, but as the right wing points forward while the left wing points backward. A third design is the triangle-shaped \nwing and is the focus of intense development of which I have personal knowledge of. \n\nThere is the possibility that chemical and biological warfare may be used by the enemy. The fact that these forms of warfare may \nbe inflicted upon us from space only fires my \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\n\n-5- \n\npersistence in having the President consider my proposal seriously for a broad and comprehensive Space Defense Initiative. \n\nThere are several fronts which must be considered in my proposal to the president. We must boost spending in new, more \npowerful radar. We must encourage more reseurch program, s /or lasers. And, we must investigate the use of microwave and pulse \nenergy devices along with directed energy weapons in space systems. Particle beams are effective over vast distances and could aid \nin space defense against intruding enemy spacecraft. \n\n\nProgress toward such an objective, since the end of World War II, has occurred in discouragingly small steps. Even so, we cannot \nafford to give up hope; we cannot afford to stop taking small steps. By the same token, we cannot afford not thinking of taking big \nones. What I suggest is a big gamble but what if the gamble pays off through a major breakthrough in technology? We have the \ntalent. We have the means. All that is lacking is the political will and determination to succeed. We must not hesitate nor falter. I \nbelieve all that I propose is possible and can be done. I ask that you weigh the risks and the benefits and consider what the alternative \noffers if we fail. \n\n\nPresidential Approval [ ] Yes [ ] No \n=======[END DOCUMENT]===: \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n\n1. In Teller’s private letter that the SDI program is called rather the Space Defense Initiative, rather than the Strategic Defense \nInitiative. \n\n2. While it is clear from the opening paragraph that Teller’s remarks throughout the letter could be construed as referring to (a) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nan extra-terrestrially based and originated threat, it is also true that his remarks could be construed (b) in the standard \nterrestrial sense as referring to the Soviet Union, or (c) in a non-standard terrestrial sense as referring to some unknown \nterrestrially originated and based threat that nonetheless possesses an advanced outer space traveling capability. \n\n3. With regard to point 2(c) above, observe that the genocidal and “cosmic war” implications Teller alludes to could clearly \nindicate the presence, within whatever unknown threat constitutes the concern of his letter, of an ideology that is \nfundamentally a “globalcidal” death cult. It goes without saying that this ideology is consonant to deeply held Nazi beliefs. \nThis may indicate an extra-terrestrial spiritual influence on the development of the ideology of Nazism. \n\n4. Finally it is to be noted that Teller outlines a program of development of an exotic array of directed energy weapons, \npresumably for offensive as well as defensive purposes against this unknown threat. \n\nPRELIMINARY SCENARIO ASSESSMENT \n\nFrom the foregoing documentary considerations, a broad scenario emerges. \n\n1. From 1933-1942, the US and the two Axis powers, Germany and Italy, recover and begin the process of back-engineering \nexotic technology discovered in crashed craft of unknown origin. Alternately, Nazi ideology formed the basis and \nenvironment for the development of a whole new physics and technology. \n\n2. From the memos of President Roosevelt to General Marshall, it is clear that the US has concentrated its scientific efforts on \nthe immediate defeat of Germany and Japan through the development and deployment of the atomic bomb via the Manhattan \nProject, and thus does not undertake immediate wartime development of the recovered technology. \n\n3. From The Reich of the Black Sun is it clear that Nazi Germany, conversely, placed the highest priority on the development of \nthe same sort of technology represented in the alleged crashes. It may be reasonably speculated that since the Kammlerstab \nhad one such back-engineering component in its departmental organization that it may have been involved in the reverse \nengineering of such a craft. Alternatively, as was seen in Part Two, there was sufficient ideological and scientific ferment in \nNazi Germany to pursue the development of the exotic physics represented by the Bell entirely independently of any need \nfor an “ET Crash” to provide the motivation or impulse. \n\n4. It is not germane to the case whether the pre-war and wartime recoveries were of extra-terrestrial origins or not. However, the \nquickness with which the USA was apparently able to redesign the recovered craft in its own “S” craft after the war indicates \nthat the technology is not so exotic as to compel an ET interpretation of its origins. It is, however, as the MAJIC-12 Cooper- \nCantwheel documents repeatedly note, exotic enough to require the assistance of the Nazi Paperclip personnel. In short, \nhome-grown American talent is too unfamiliar with the type of physics and engineering that the recovered vehicles, whatever \ntheir origin may be, imply. \n\n5. It also appears from the analysis of documents in the previous section that MJ-12 was involved, and may form the ultimate \nmotivation behind, the murders of JFK and Secretary James Forrestal. The subsequent spin-off and privatization and \ninternationalization of the group — as alleged by Cooper’s Source 1 - would seem to indicate that some internal influence, \nwith such international and financial connections, within the MJ-12 group was successful in gaining control of the group and \nwresting it from the control of the US government. Only two such groups are alluded to in the documents examined thus far: \n(a) the Masons, in the form of “the 33 investors” of Document 5 (implying the participation and involvement of fraternal \ngroups in the financing and research of these Black projects); and (b) the Paperclip scientists, implying a connection to, and \nthe continued existence of, post-war international Nazi organizations such as O.D.E.S.S.A. and others. \n\n6. In such documents as have been examined, no specific technological or performance characteristic of the recovered craft is of \nsufficient performance characteristics to indicate an interstellar origin much less and interplanetary one, since the stated \nspeeds for the vehicles are far below what they would need to be to make such travel possible. Moreover, it is apparent that \nthe performance characteristics in most respects is consonant more with very high altitude high performance craft flying \nwithin the terrestrial atmosphere. Other than the allusions to atomic and magnetic drives, which would be consonant with \nexo-atmospheric flight, the speeds are still far too slow for practical interplanetary travel within our own solar system. \n\n7. This in turn suggests that at the highest levels of MJ-12 a “deep cover” disinformation operation is being waged, to make \npeople think in terms of (friendly) extra-terrestrial visitation as an explanation, while it is apparent from the examined \ndocuments that there is an even deeper level of concern that the craft are indeed hostile and have “globalcidal” intentions. \nSuch an ideology is consonant with deeply held Nazi beliefs and is thus another subtle indicator of the nature of the US \ngovernment’s concern and the reason for the high security operation that is MJ-12. \n\n8. In respect to point 7, it is to be noted that Robert and Ryan Wood seem unable to concentrate on internal technical details of \nany MJ-12 document without obfuscating them in favor of the ET Hypothesis. \n\n9. A possible means of explaining MJ-12 motivations behind the murder or sanction of the murder of JFK should be noted. If, \nas one of the documents suggested, JFK planned a joint expedition with the USSR to militarize the moon as a means of \n\n\n\ndefense against the threat posed by UFOs, then this would seem, in light of the pattern emerging of US-USSR cooperation \nregarding Antarctica, that Kennedy posed a threat to MJ-12 and thereby to the secret Paperclip influence over MJ-12 and \nover the monopoly on the research and technology and weapons developed under its aegis. \n\n10. The year 1969 is the year MJ-12 is privatized and internationalized. Thus, this might represent, on one point of view, a step \nin the reassembly of the broken and scattered parts of Nazi secret weapons black projects. If so, then corroboration is rather \neasy to find: it should be a relatively easy thing to look for details of corporate actions, mergers, and maneuvers and \ntechnological developments from that time forward to see if a pattern — if any — emerges that would corroborate or deny \nthis hypothesis. Alternatively, one might look for strange corporate actions immediately prior to and during the period of the \nJFK assassination that have a German connection or flavor. \n\nWith these thoughts in hand, it is time to turn to the most sensational MAJIC-12 document in the Cooper-Cantwheel collection on \nthe Woods’ website. This is \n\n\n\n10. Document 12: The MJ-12 “Bowen Encyclopedia on Flying Saucers \n\n\nThe Kammlerstab and Nazi Saucers \n\nThe Bowen “Encyclopedia on Flying Saucers”, dated by Robert and Ryan Wood on their website to sometime in 1959, is the \nmost crucial piece of MJ-12 documentary evidence that one can adduce in support of the above scenario and the thesis advanced in \nReich of the Black Sun that what crashes in Roswell was a Nazi “saucer.” In their website dedicated to the Cooper-Cantwheel and \nother MJ-12 documents, a website dedicated also to defending the ET Hypothesis as the primary explanation for 1940s UFO \nobservations and crash retrievals and whose header motto is “Evidence That We Are Not Alone”,— the following introductory \nsummary is given to the Bowen “Encyclopedia of UFOs”: \n\nPerhaps the most stunning physical evidence for the existence of the TOP SECRET/MAJIC program is this original 339 page \nmanuscript about flying saucers. Written by Vernon Bowen, the original is on watermarked paper with red TOP \nSECRET/MAJIC stampings on some of the chapters. Most of the rest of the document is marked CONFIDENTIAL. Original \nhandwritten marginalia shows linkages to Project White Hot, Twining, Vannevar Bush, Moon Dust, and Donald Menzel. A \nwell written snapshot of the public history of flying saucers from 1947 to 1954. Bowen was personally well-connected to many \ntop people. \n\nA perusal of the document itself, which includes a brief biography of Bowen apparently written by himself which I include just as \nthe document appears on the Woods’ website, indicates that the entire 339 page manuscript was his own private assembly of UFO \nreports, with his own stunning conclusions. This report must have apparently caused quite a flap of its own in MJ-12 corridors, since \nit was immediately classified “TOP SECRET/MAJIC” and foreign distribution was prohibited. A glance at its contents will show \nwhy.

While there, he wrote and \nsupervised copy on Kelvinator, Division of American Motors Corporation. And while there, he originated and wrote the Rambler \ncartoon campaign which has been credited, in part, with taking Rambler from a poor fourth into a strong position of contender with \nthe “Big Three” - and in helping to raise American Motors stock from a low of 5 _ to a high of 99 _. \n\nIn his spare time, Vernon Bowen has also written free-lance material. All of his published writings are in books or phonograph \nrecords for children. \n\nOne of his children’s books was a Junior Literary Guild selection. Three of them are now used to some extent for remedial \nreading in certain public schools. \n\nHis last book, The Emperor’s White Horses, the story of what happened to the famous Lipiszaners of the Spanish Riding School, \nVienna, was double-checked by those who participated in the saving of the horses: Colonel Alois Podhejsky, Director, the Spanish \nRiding School, Hoffburg, Vienna; Mr. \n\n==========[PAGE B RE AK]========== \n\nCharles R.

Perhaps Henry J. Taylor, Billy Ross, and \nsome other commentators were right when they said, quite early in the game, that flying saucers are secret weapons. The only \ntrouble was, they said they were U. S. weapons. Such may not have been the case at all. But certainly, the Taylor “expose” was the \none thing that drew instant, emphatic and universal denial by every branch of the armed services, with even a spokesman for the \nPresident considering it important enough to issue a White House denial. There has been no such overwhelming denial of the \nextraterrestrial theory — there has even been semi-encouragement of this theory all along by the Air Force - although on one \noccasion a press conference was held following Major Keyhoe’s article in TRUE that claimed saucers were from outer space, and \nthere was another denial when President Eisenhower said, in late 1954, that he had been told that saucers were not from outer space. \n\nBut, when it was said that saucers were U. S. secret warcraft, there was instant, overwhelming denial. \n\nYet there is evidence that saucers may be a new and different type of earth craft. \n\nThis evidence is not secret. It has been published to millions of people in newspapers and magazines. This writer has had no \naccess to classified information of any kind. There is absolutely nothing here that \n\n==========[PAGE B RE AK]========== \n\ndoes not come from publications. The Major thing?} here that the Intelligence Headquarters of Russia, England, Italy, Spain, \nSweden, Yugoslavia and every other country of any consequence of the face of the globe does not know - or could easily acquire by \nthe most amateurish of efforts. \n\nThere are no secrets here in this phase of the questioning of the nature of saucers. If there were secrets, they have long since been \nrevealed and given away. \n\nBut no writer, to this author’s knowledge, has ever brought together the bits of this part of the jig-saw puzzle. Yet they are very \nsignificant bits and merit the consideration of anyone trying to understand the mystery of the saucers. \n\nLet’s try to put some of the bits together: \n\nPractically all writers on the subject of saucers have discounted the possibility that the saucers have their home basis right here on \nearth for three or four reasons - and, at first sight, these are very good reasons indeed. Among them are: \n\n1. The extremely high speed. \n\n2. The seemingly impossible maneuvering and the matter of G-pull — the pull of the earth’s gravity - on any occupant or \noccupants. \n\n3. The lack of sound in objects flying faster than sound. The motors of conventional planes roar, or their jets sound like giant \nblowtorches in the sky. And when a plan of conventional design passes through the sound barrier, it causes a noise like a \nclap of thunder. Many saucers observed were not [unreadable] a stationary position or a slow speed into speeds that would \ntake them through the \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\nsound barrier. \n\n4. Glow. Many reporters of saucers described them as glowing, either with a greenish-blue glare on the inside, or with \ncompletely glowing exterior - reddish, orange, yellow, or other shades of the spectrum. \n\nNow, how about these points? Do they absolutely eliminate the possibility that saucers may be earth craft, after all? Most writers, \nciting these points, have dismissed the possibilities. But let’s take the points, one by one, and analyze them. \n\n1. Speed. Conventional craft, using a principle of “boring through” air, or being forced through air, can get red hot, have metals \ncreep, can fall apart or bum to a crisp from friction. However, by utilizing the principle of “Coanda’s Effect,” with the object flying \nin a partial vacuum of its own making, this problem could be overcome. In the opinion of Professor Henri Coanda, discoverer of the \neffect, as given to Art Buchwald, it would be overcome. In many observations of extremely high speeds in saucers, the most extreme \nspeeds were not observed in the dense, lower layers of our atmosphere, but at higher altitudes, far, far above the earth. And a great \nmany observations of saucers have indicated that they rise in a series of “stairsteps,” and achieve greatest velocity only after gaining \nthe upper reaches of the atmosphere where density, air resistance and friction would be much less. \n\nAnd on this subject of speed it is well to remember that speeds seemingly impossible to earth craft in 1947, when the first when \nthe first saucers were widely reported, seem terribly old-fashioned today. In 1947, men were trying to break the speed of sound — \nand secretly had succeeded. But this speed of something over 700 mph became old hat in just six years, when Maj. Charles E. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeager, in December, 1955, flew \n\n\n==========[PAGE BREAK 1========== \n\na plane of conventional [unreadable] at more than 1,600 mph, or something more than two and one-half times the speed of sound. \n\nAnd by May, 1955, scientists at Langley Field, Virginia, were reporting that they were doing research on guided missiles that \nmight reach the speed of 15,000 mph. The scientists pointed out that then (1955) they were flying missiles at speeds of 3,000 mph \nfrom Wallops Island, Virginia. \n\nSpeed, and speed alone — even the fantastic higher speeds reported in saucers - would not seem to rule out completely the \npossibility that saucers are earth-made. \n\n2. Maneuverability and G-pull on occupant. A great deal of nonsense has been written about the impossibility of having anything \nhuman survive the mad maneuvers observed in saucers: acute-angled turns with no slackening in speed; high-speed circling of two \ndiscs in the air, as if they were “charging their batteries;” tremendous acceleration from practically zero to thousands of miles an \nhour; abrupt reverses in direction. \n\nBut do all those things rule out the possibility that saucers might be man-made? \n\nNot at all. First, they might be unmanned missiles — especially the tiny saucers that have been reported. Next, now things are \ncoming to light about G-pull and the amount a human can survive, about “weightlessness”, about other factors that may enter into \nthe picture. \n\nFor instance, in the magazine Flying, March, 1951, p, 34, First Lieutenant Hugh F. McLaurin. USAF, answered the following \nquestions: “What would happen [unreadable] plane and suddenly catapulted into the sky at 13,000 mph? Would you sweat \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\nblood? Would you be killed by acceleration or by pressure change? The answers are all no. Lt. McLaurin knew. He went through \nsuch a speed in a simulated test and survived. \n\nAgain, on G-pull, Major Donald E. Keyhoe, writing in TRUE, December, 1952, wrote: “By applying thrust in an opposite \ndirection, abruptly reversing thrust, an object can be halted in seconds. Tests made with a G-sled by the Air Force has shown that, \nfor a fraction of a second, human beings can take a force of 45 G’s and survive.” \n\nMaybe Major Keyhoe was a little premature in his announcement of this fact, but as proof of it, USAF, on December 27, 1954, \nannounced that one of its officers, Lt. Col. John P. Stapp, had gone from a record land speed of 652 mph to a dead stop in 1 _ \nseconds without ill effects. \n\nThis quick stop was made at Holloman Air Development Center at Alamogordo, New Mexico. In the test, Col. Stapp was \nstrapped to a 2,000-pound rocket sled. The only ill effects he suffered were a few blood blisters from dust particles in the air and two \nblack eyes, caused by his eyeballs being thrown forward against his eyelids during the deceleration period. \n\nIn stopping, Col. Stapp withstood a pressure equal to 35 G’s. His “weight” was more than three tons. \n\nOn the evening of December 28, 1954, there appeared in The New York World Telegram and Sun a writeup of an interview with \nCol. Stapp, made on the 27 th in which the colonel said that he expected to travel at 1,200 mph on the sled. This would be nearly \ntwice as fast, with proportionate step-up in G-pressure, with a violent stop. \n\nCan man withstand the violent maneuvers and sudden decelerations observed in flying saucers? \n\nWhat do you think? \n\n\nTOP SECRET/MAJIC \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\nTOP SECRET /M A JIC \n\nAnother factor sometimes overlooked by writers on flying saucers is the phenomenon of weightlessness. If you don’t weigh \nanything, ie., if you have a condition of zero gravity, you can’t very well be slammed around by violent maneuvers in the air. Some \nwriters have, however, pointed out that extraterrestrial craft, using some form of magnetic propulsion, might create their own \ngravitational fields and thus be free of gravitational pull from the earth. Maybe it is not as complicated as all that. In TRUE for July, \n1954, writer Don Dwiggins described weightlessness as experienced in a two-seater plane flown by Maj. Edward J. Rackham, \nUSAF acceptance pilot at Lockheed’s Van Nuys, California, plant. They went up to only 20,000 feet and then went into a ballistic \ncurve. The result was weightlessness. Mr. Dwiggins photographed a pack of cigarettes floating free in the cabin of the plane. \n\nIf weightlessness can be achieved with a ballistic curve, perhaps it can be achieved in some other, but fairly easy way. And such \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweightlessness might permit violent maneuvering, such as has been (reported?) in flying saucers. \n\nBut, if you will read further on the subject of weightlessness, you will find that this phenomenon presents grave hazards to the \nairman. LIFE Magazine, in an article in its December 6, 1954, issue, pointed out that weightlessness is a highly unpleasant sensation. \nMr. airman has been able to stand it for more than 45 seconds. It produces severe disorientation. It dislocates all sense of direction. It \nproduces nausea, nervous distress, loss of ability to co-ordinate, inability to guide the complex machinery of today’s flying craft. \n\nSo one argument negates the other here. \n\nTOP SECRET/MAJIC \n\n==========[PAGE B RE AK]========== \n\nTOP SECRET /M A JIC \n\n\n3. The [unreadable] faster than sound. \n\nHere, again, let us refer to the new principle of flight, the “Coanda Effect.” If a craft is flying in a partial vacuum, not pushing and \ncompressing the air in front of it, or “boring through” it, (it is) conceivable it might be possible to glide through the atmosphere and \n[unreadable] through the sound barrier without the “clap of thunder” made by conventional planes. As for the lack of sound issuing \nfrom the vehicle itself — motor, engine, turbine, jet — if there exists some new and little publicized principle of flight, plus some \nnew and unpublished method of propulsion — magnetic, anti-gravitational, atomic - it might be possible to achieve soundlessness or \nnear soundlessness. \n\n4. Glow. This is one to really stump the experts, in trying to explain saucers as completely terrestrial craft. But certain atomic, \nradioactive materials glow with the same kind of blue-green glaze noted in some saucer interiors. But how a crew could be protected \nfrom gamma rays emanating from such materials poses an unanswerable question. As to glowing exteriors - Major Keyhoe had \nwritten at some length, theorizing that the glow of extraterrestrial space craft could come from varying degrees of heat caused by \nfriction — from preactically white-hot to red-hot, to orange-hot, to yellow-hot, going from highest speeds to the lowest. Perhaps this \nsame principle would hold true of earth-made craft, as well as extraterrestrial vehicles. As to the question of materials which could \nwithstand these heats — present rocket speeds, as published in newspapers — are above 4,000 mph. Such speeds must cause \ntemperatures that make rockets glow - like saucers. \n\nAll this may be very thin evidence that saucers could be earth craft. But [unreadable] a lot of evidence \n\nTOP SECRET /M A JIC \n\n==========[PAGE B REAK]========== \n\n\nTOP SECRET /M A JIC \n\nused to support [unreadable] thought. And there is a great deal of other evidence that is factual, not based upon pure supposition \nand theory. \n\nFor instance, Professor Coanda discovered his new principle of flight back in 1937. This principle, described previously, in \nessence is that if you curve a jet of air, or many jets of air, you also create an artificial cyclone, with the tremendous lift of a cyclone, \nand can lift and maneuver a many-tonned object because you create a vacuum above the whirling blasts of the jets. \n\nHere is a note that may fit: \n\nIn The Washington Daily News for May 14, 1949, was a copyrighted story that the flying discs were of Spanish-Nazi origin. The \nauthor held the view that the discs were very real, and that they were of a new “gyroscopic ” design. \n\nHere is another note that also fits somewhere into the picture: On May 22. 1952, there died in Rome, Italy, Giuseppe Belluzo, \nseventy-six, Italian scientists and former cabinet member. To quote from an article about him in The New York Herald Tribune: \n\n“Mr. Belluzo, who was Minister of National Economy and Minister of Public Instruction during the Fascist regime of Benito \nMussolini, was also an authority on cannon and projectiles and a firm believer in flying discs. \n\n“In a newspaper article in 1950, he said that models for flying discs had been drawn in Germany and Italy at about the same \ntime in 1942, and were shown to both Mussolini and Hitler. \n\n“ ‘There is nothing supernatural or Martian about flying discs, ’ Mr. [unreadable] simply national \n\nTOP SECRET /M A JIC \n\n\n[END] \n\n\nANALYSIS: \n\n\nAnd here, just when it was getting good, the excerpt on the Woods’ website ends. Nonetheless, enough detail is in it that readers of \nReich of the Black Sun and of this book will have noted some stunning things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.First, it is evident that Bowen’s personal contacts brought him into contact with the head of General Patton’s intelligence as \nthe following two statements attest: \n\na. “ Charles R. Codman, Col. Ret., (deceased), who was the aide of the late General George S. Patton, Jr., U.S. Army, \nand who was present at the special performance given for General Patton and his spear-head armored division at \nRostau; ” \n\nb. “Mr. Charles H. Reed, Col., ret., Richmond Virginian, who really spearheaded the saving of the Spanish Riding \nSchool and its horses while on his mission of persuading the head of German Intelligence to turn over to the U.S. \nthe many truckloads of documents buried on the Czech-Austrian border - documents which are still secret today.” \n\nThus, General Patton’s Third Army operations in the late war were connected not only with gathering in the treasure trove of \nthe Kammlerstab’s top secret research, but also German military intelligence’s archives that had been secreted along the \nCzech-German border. These “archives” could in turn refer to one of three things: \n\na. The archives of German Intelligence, particularly of General Reinhard Gehlen’s Fremde Heere Ost; \n\nb. The actual German War Archives, which as recounted in Reich of the Black Sun had been transferred to Thuringia, \nwhich is along the German-Czech border; \n\nc. The secreted cache of reports, patents, and so on that the Kammlerstab moved to this area probably under the direct \nauspices and oversight of Kammler himself. The information at the end of Bowen’s “Encyclopedia” tends to \ncorroborate that this third alternative was the actual case, and tends also to support the thesis, argued in Reich of the \nBlack Sun, that General Patton was somehow involved in a highly classified operation designed to secure Kammler \nand the Kammlerstab archives. \n\n3. The bulk of the Bowen UFO Encyclopedia that is extant at the Woods’ website is from Chapter XIV of Bowen’s book, and \nit appears that Bowen most favors the terrestrial hypothesis as the explanation for the origin of the saucer phenomenon, and \nmoreover that he believes them to be the product of secret black projects weapons development. \n\n4. He then cites the newspaper article that clearly reveals what he thinks the origin of saucers to be. The secret projects of Nazi \nGermany (and Fascist Italy!). \n\na. It is to be pointed out that Bowen’s conclusions, coming as they do through personal acquaintance with Patton’s \nintelligence aide, most likely set off alarm Bells — pun intended - within MJ-12, and that they also appear before the \nfirst publication of Renato Vesco’s Intercept But Don’t Shoot which likewise attributes the origin of the post-war \nUFO phenomenon to the wartime development of Nazi flying saucers and to Belluzo. Bowen has thus arrived at his \nconclusions independently and a full decade before Vesco’s book was first published. \n\nb. Bowen additionally provides the background that Belluzzo/Bellonzo was a highly placed official in Mussolini's \ngovernment, and in addition to his expertise in steam turbines alleged in other sources, is also an expert in projectile \nballistics. This would make Belluzzo/Bellonzo a leading candidate for membership in Mussolini’s Top Secret UFO \nstudy group RS33 led by Marconi. \n\nc. The strong implication of Bowen’s remarks is that someone somewhere is continuing the secret development of this \ntechnology, and the context of the excerpt of his Encyclopedia also points to the people doing it: Nazis. \n\n5. The last point raises the problem of the reasons for MJ-12’s classification of his work. After all, as his preface makes clear that \nthe work is drawn entirely from public accounts and sources. One may therefore conclude that the reasons for the \nclassification lie precisely in the conclusions he draws from these of a terrestrial origin and a connection to Nazism and secret \nblack project development of these technologies, a conclusion at odds with the “ET cover story” being adopted at the highest \nand deepest levels of the US military. Bowen himself makes this clear over and over in the chapter cited. But beyond this, \nwhat deeper motivation might lie behind the classification? I can see only three: \n\na. The classification was extended because MJ-12 itself knew of the ultimate origins of at least the Roswell saucer, and \nsuspected an independent entity was continuing the Nazi research, a hypothesis advanced in Reich of the Black Sun; \n\nb. The classification was extended because MJ-12, by this date, was already heavily infiltrated by the very Nazis and \nPaperclip personnel who were beginning to exercise great influence over the direction of the project and beginning to \nwrest it from control of the US government. \n\nc. The membership of MJ-12 was divided into two camps at its top decision making level between groups with (1) no \nNazi connections or sympathies, and who are ignorant of the extent of Nazi influence and R&D being conducted \n\n\n\nindependently. This group suspects an independent entity is continuing the Nazi weapons development, and that this \nindependent group is Nazi, and classifies the Encyclopedia for that reason; (2) a second group with Nazi ties and \nsympathies and perhaps ongoing contact with whatever entity continued, under a new name, which for convenience I \nhave called the “SS Brotherhood of the Bell”. This group, for entirely different reasons, would want to deflect \nattention away not only from Nazi survival, but from Nazi continuance of advance technologies and weapons \nprojects, and from the fact that this continuance was independent of any sovereign state. Classification by either \ngroup would also be unavoidable since the document also hints that Patton’s strange end-war operations can only be \nsatisfactorily explained in connection to German military intelligence and/or to the Kammlerstab, its archives and \npersonnel, to American Black projects and nominal American “jurisdiction”. \n\n6.The essence of these conclusions tends to corroborate as well the basic thesis behind William Harbison’s novel Genesis that \nsuch independent development was indeed the ultimate controlling power behind the more well-known UFO crash-retrieval \ncases and that this power was specifically tied to Nazism. \n\n\n\nB. The Day After Corso: \n\n\n\nAn Examination of Corso’s The Day After Roswell In the Light of the Cooper-Cantwheel Documents And \n\nGerman Wartime Technology \n\n\nCorso’s thesis bears repeating once again: \n\nMy boss, General Trudeau, asked me to use the army’s ongoing weapons development and research program as a way to filter \nthe Roswell technology into the mainstream of industrial development through the military defense contracting program. Today, \nitems such as lasers, integrated circuitry, fiber-optics networks, accelerated particle-beam devices, and even the Kevlar material \nin bulletproof vests are all commonplace. Yet the seeds for all of them were found in the crash of the alien craft at Roswell and \nturned up in my files fourteen years latter.— \n\nThe elements of this thesis may be broken down into the following list: \n\n1. Something crashed in New Mexico; \n\n2. It was recovered by the US Army Air Force; \n\n3. It contained exotic technology of such a nature as to compel the interpretation that what crashed was extraterrestrial in origin; \n\n4. The recovery of this technology from the crash was back-engineered and led to the ET-derived technologies of \n\na. the integrated circuit (and by implication, its forerunner, the transistor); \n\nb. the laser; \n\nc. fiber-optics; \n\nd. particle beams and particle accelerators. \n\n\nPoints 1 and 2 are disputed by no one, so we pass immediately to point 3. \n\nCorso himself, while wishing to maintain that the technology pointed conclusively to something extra-terrestrial in origin, also \nparadoxically and repeatedly indicates that something about this exotic extra-terrestrial technology looked peculiarly familiar, and he \ndoes so often in the very next breath, as in the following example: \n\nIn those confusing hours after the discovery of the crashed Roswell alien craft, the army determined that in the absence of any \nother information it had to be an extraterrestrial. Worse, the fact that this craft and other flying saucers had been surveilling our \ndefensive installations and even seemed to evidence a technology we ’d seen evidenced by the Nazis caused the military to \nassume these flying saucers had hostile intentions and might have even interfered in human events during the war. — \n\nOn the previous page Corso indicates the technology he has in mind, because the military feared that at first “the craft might have \nbeen an experimental Soviet weapon because it bore a resemblance to some of the German-designed aircraft that had made their \nappearances near the end of the war, especially the crescent-shaped Horton (sic.) flying wing.”— \n\nHorten Flying Wing in Flight Before World War Two \n\n\n\nOn the face of it this is an odd statement to make, since Corso, who was himself involved in Operation Paperclip, most likely \nknew that the Horten Flying Wings were brought to this country, not the Soviet Union. But there is more. \n\nAs early as 1947, scientists who had gone to the Air Material Commnd at Wright Field to see the debris were speculating that \nthe electronic potential of the Roswell craft reminded them of the German and British antigravity experiments of the 1920s and \n1930s. General Twining was reported to have said more than once that the name of the Serbian electrical engineer and \ninventor of alternating current, Nikola Tesla, kept bubbling up in the conversation because the scientists examining the \ndamaged craft described the way it must have converted an electromagnetic field into an antigravity field. And, of course, the \ncraft itself reminded them of the German experimental fighter aircraft that made their appearance near the end of the war but \nthat had been in development ever since the 1930s.— \n\nWell might the name of Tesla have come up repeatedly, since Tesla toward the end of his life made a rather astonishing series of \nstatements concerning his “dynamic theory of gravity”: \n\nDuring the succeeding two years (1893 and 1894) of intense concentration I was fortunate enough to make two far reaching \ndiscoveries. The first was a dynamic theory of gravity, which I have worked out in all details and hope to give to the world very \nsoon. It explains the causes of this force and the motions of heavenly bodies under its influence so satisfactorily that it will put \nan end to the idle speculation and false conceptions, as that of curved space.... \n\nOnly the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses \nwith space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the working of \nthe universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena. \n\n....I consider myself the original discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in \nmatter other than that received from the environment. \n\n....It applies rigorously to molecules and atoms as well as to the largest heavenly bodies, and to all matter in the universe in \nany phase of its existence from its very first formation to its ultimate disintegration.— \n\nI believe that what Tesla had derived in his “dynamic theory of gravity” was precisely a vorticular model of the aether. \n\nIn any case, it is significant that his name kept surfacing in the scientific discussions concerning the Roswell debris at Wright \nField, according to Corso, and that it did so also in the context of “British and German” 1930s antigravity experiments. Once again, \nsomething about the technology looked very familiar: \n\nAt the very least, Twining had suggested, the crescent-shaped craft looked so uncomfortably like the German Horten wings our \nflyers had seen at the end of the war that he had to suspect the Germans had bumped into something we didn’t know about. \n\nAnd his conversations with Wemher von Braun and Willy Ley at Alamogordo in the days after the crash confirmed this. They \n\n\ndidn’t want to be thought of as verriikt (crazy) but intimated that there was a deeper story about what the Germans had \nengineered.— \n\nThe answer of course is that which Corso implies: there was a “German Roswell” before the war.— The development by the \nGermans of Tesla’s ideas or of a vortex aether atom model are never even mentioned as a possibility by Corso. \n\nSo what of Corso’s allegations about fiber optics, lasers, and integrated circuits, three of the “ET technologies” that jump-started \nAmerica’s post-war technological surge according to the his thesis? \n\n\n1. Corso on the Integrated Circuit and Transistor \n\n\nRegarding the integrated circuit, Corso himself notes that one requirement for space exploration was not lost on his superior, \nGeneral Trudeau: “the development of an integrated-circuit technology so that the electronic components of spacecraft could be \nminiaturized to fit the size requirements of rocket-propelled vehicles.\"— \n\nThe transistor is a crucial step on the technology tree from the vacuum tube to the development of the integrated circuit. Corso has \nthis to say about it: \n\nThe entire development arc of the radio tube, from Edison’s first experiments with filament for his incandescent lightbulb to the \nvacuum tubes that formed the switching mechanisms of ENIAC, lasted about fifty years. The development of the silicon \ntransistor seemed to come upon us in a matter of months. And, had I not seen the silicon wafers from the Roswell crash with \nmy own eyes, held them in my own hands talked about them with Hermann Oberth, Wernher von Braun, or Hans Kohler, and \nheard the reports from these now dead scientists of the meetings between Nathan Twining, Vannevar Bush, and researchers at \nBell Labs, I would have thought the invention of the transistor was a miracle. I now know how it came about.— \n\nAccording to Corso’s thesis, the answer is, of course that it was all due to exotic recovered ET technology recovered at Roswell. \nNote especially the “miraculous silicon wafers,” the marvelous semiconducting miracle that would make the integrated circuit \npossible. \n\nBut now Corso’s thesis begins to collapse, at least in this matter, for if it was true that miniaturization of electronic components \nwas an essential feature for America’s space program, then it was much more so a necessity for the Nazis and their rockets, if they \nwere ever to be turned into viable weapons for hurling heavy atomic bombs at anyone. \n\nAs for the transistor, whose “discovery history pedigree” is admitted to be obscure at best by many researchers, it did indeed \nappear to burst on the world in the late 1940s from nowhere.... \n\n....unless one recalls a very similar looking device, already in use by the Germans, in 1940: \n\nTelefunken \n\n\n\nOne can only wonder then, how far this work was pressed from this little tube’s appearance and use in Nazi Germany in 1940 to \nthe “discovery” of the transistor in 1947. Something was seeded into American industry, something “alien,” but alien in the sense of \n“foreign ” both scientifically, ethnically and politically. \n\nAnd as for the miraculous silicon semiconductor chips, a picture suffices to dispense with Corso’s thesis on this point as well: \n\nGerman Semi-Conductor Wafers Manufactured During the War for Use in Infrared Sights, Fom a Combined Intelligence \n\nObjectives Committee Report \n\n\n\nIn other words, the miraculous “E.T. technology” that Corso refers to already existed in its prototypical stages of development in \nNazi Germany. \n\nThus, as far as the transistor goes, the historical and verifiable record points, not to “E.T.” as the origin of the Roswell debris and \nrecovered technology, but to Nazi Germany. \n\n\n2. Lasers \n\n\nBut what of lasers themselves, which Corso also maintains was one of the many devices stemming from the recovered “ET” \ntechnology from the Roswell crash? \n\nAs my previous book Reich of the Black Sun and as chapter 5 of this book showed,— lasers too were one aspect of “quantum \ncoherence” being researched by the Germans. Igor Witkowski is even more specific in his account of just what the Germans were \nafter, for they were not, it seems, after an ordinary optical laser: \n\nAfter all it is common knowledge that among other things work was also carried out on some kind of “X-ray laser” - a source \nof coherent X-ray or gamma radiation, which is well-known to be lethal to living organisms at high intensity. Thanks to \nsearches carried out in German archives it has been possible to establish that in 1944 a special Luftwaffe research establishment \nreceived the task to develop such a weapon, situated at the town of Gross Ostheim. Materials relating to this work are currently \nlocated in a civilian establishment — the Karlsruhe research centre and were disclosed several years ago.... One can make out \nthat three different lethal radiation emitters were worked on and that the construction of such a device, effective as an anti¬ \naircraft weapon lay within the Third Reich’s range of possibilities and its military use was possible in a relatively short time - \nthat is to say still before the end of the war. The third and most mature version of the weapon assumed the irradiation of a target \n5 kilometers away at a rate of 7 rads a second for 30 seconds which, as affirmed in the report, was completely sufficient to \ntotally paralyze the aircraft’s crew. — \n\nWhile the description of the weapon Witkowski describes does not sound like a genuine cohered X-ray was achieved (noting its \nlimited operational range and relatively low dosage of radiation), it nonetheless is also possible that the idea of coherence of X-rays \nand gamma rays was the goal. Again, this means that the concept of coherence predated Roswell as did the first experimental steps \ntowards its realization. There is nothing necessarily extra-terrestrial whatsoever about it. \n\n\n3. Fiber Optics \n\n\nThen what of fiber optics? Surely this, at least, was so exotic that no terrestrially-based proto-typical technology existed in 1947? \n“Members of the retrieval team who foraged around inside the spacecraft on the morning of the discovery,” Corso states, \n\nTold Colonel Blancard back at the 509 th (Bomb group) that they were amazed they couldn’t find any conventional wiring. \nWhere were the electrical connections? They didn’t understand the function of the printed circuit wafers they found, but, even \nmore important, they were completely mystified by the single glass filaments that ran through the panels of the ship.— \n\nSo once again off Colonel Corso went to consult with a German Paperclip scientist, Hans Kohler: \n\nThe technology was still very new, Hans Kohler told me during a private briefing in early 1962, but the promise of using light \nas a carrier of all kinds of signals through single-filament glass strands was holding great promise. He explained that the premise \nof optical fibers was to have a filament of glass so fine and free of any impurities that nothing would impede the light beam \nmoving along the center of the shaft.— \n\nBut unfortunately, at this point here there exists an indicator — a very slight one — that some work along these lines was also \nunderway in Nazi Germany. \n\nThere exists a list of special German research projects in radar, homing devices, and so on that describes a project headed a \nProfessor Karolus, based in Leipzig, whose purpose was to investigate the modulation of mercury lighting for the purposes of “light \ntelephony” that would have operated in the infrared band. Nothing more is known about it, but the connection of the project to \ntelephony does raise questions, one that Igor Witkowski himself asks very bluntly: “Could this have referred to some kind of \nprecursor to present day optical fibre telephony?”— \n\nWhat are we to conclude from all this? \n\nAs regards the MAJIC-12 documents examined here, one has indications of a definite pattern of exotic though entirely terrestrial \ntechnology, and one that might be under independent or quasi-independent development. And during the period from the end of the \nwar to the early 1960s, only one entity really would have an interest in doing so, a “Nazi International.” \n\nAs regards the Corso thesis of Roswell, it is clear that, in two out of the three cases mentioned here - the transistor and the laser — \nthat he adduces were the results of ET seeded technology, there are wartime German antecedents in the technology tree. In the last \ncase — fiber optics — there is a vague reference to “light telephony” that might represent a prototypical technology leading \neventually to the modem fiber optic technology. \n\nHowever, when Corso’s thesis is viewed in conjunction with the MAJIC-12 documents reviewed here, and in conjunction with \nwhat is known of wartime German research achievements, his thesis shows itself to be rather weak. Indeed, more documentary \nsubstantiation exists for a terrestrial and German origin for some of the technology he cites in support of his thesis, than there exists \nevidence for its extra-terrestrial origin, for which Corso adduces not a shred of evidence other than his stories. Indeed, in these \nanecdotal stories Corso every now and then includes statements to the effect that our military saw the “German resemblance” in the \n“ET” technology recovered at Roswell! Unless one is to believe the Nazis’ own Thule Society-inspired belief that the white Aryan \nrace is ultimately of extra-terrestrial origin, the indicators seem preponderantly to point to terrestrial, and most probably German \norigins for the technology. \n\nFinally, the MAJIC-12 documents examined in this chapter either allude indirectly to, or openly assert, the involvement of the \nshadowy UFO group in the assassination of President Kennedy. \n\nBut before leaving the subjects of MAJIC-12, Nazi Paperclip personnel, Roswell, and Colonel Corso, a final word shows how \nweirdly, and how intimately, they are all connected: \n\nCol. Philip Corso, info source for last year’s book The Day After Roswell, and temporary darling of Ufology, has brought \nattention to himself with the revelation of a history in spin control and association with right wing extremist elements in the \nmilitary as well as his former ties to a semi-secret society called the “Shickshinny Knights of Malta” \n\nBefore The Day After Roswell was a gleam in the eye of someone at Simon and Schuster, Peter Dale Scott wrote about \nCorso in Deep Politics and the Death of JFK. In the light of the fact that he is working on another book with Roswell co-author \nWilliam Bimes (to be entitled The Day After Dallas) it is worth noting that Corso was an investigator involved with the Warren \nCommission who according to Scott, “built on ... anti CIA paranoia by telling his friend and fellow Senate staffer [for \nsegregationist Strom Thurmond] Julien Sourwine, who made sure it was relayed to the FBI, that Oswald was tied to a \ncommunist ring inside the CIA, and was doubling as an informant for the FBI.” \n\n\n....The Shickshinny Knights of Malta was apparently founded by old-guard White Russians who emigrated to the US after \nthe revolution, eventually settling in Shickshinny, Pennsylvania. By the end of the Second World War, the organization had \nevolved into a haven for mothballed right wing military intelligence personnel. When Corso became involved with the Knights, \n(circa 1963-64) the organization seemed to operate as an underground think tank and spin factory.... Corso disavows any \nassociation with the group. \n\nPerhaps this has little to do with Corso’s present activities, however a few people in the UFO community have expressed the \nfeeling that his claims in Roswell may be the result of a few verifyable (sic) facts diluted with much more mis- or \ndisinformation. If this is true, Corso himself may not be aware of it. In light of the man’s history, this may not be far off the \nmark, and there is reason to suspect that he may have been called out of retirement to play the role of publicist one last time.— \n\nThat Corso was an investigator for the Warren Commission is a direct connection to the JFK assassination, but more important are \nthe allegations of associations with a “White Russian emigre community” that after the war became a “haven for mothballed right \nwing military intelligence personnel.” \n\nJust whose “mothballed right wing military intelligence personnel” we already know: General Reinhard Gehlen’s Fremde Heere \nOst with its myriad of “emigre” front organizations. Just what all this has to do with the assassination of President Kennedy was \nalready briefly touched upon in chapter three, “From Russia with Love,” but now, it is time to go into the detailed connections of \nGerman military intelligence, Nazi technology, German money, and the tragic events in Dallas in November of 1963. \n\n\n9 . \n\n\n„Mae Brussellsprouts:“ \n\n\nNazi Survival and JFK \n\n\n“The old war lords are going to come back. (South America) is full of these Nazis!.... They will know that is only one kind of \npeople that would do such a thing... that would have to he the Nazis and that is who is in power. ” \n\nJack Rub'fdT- \n\n\n“In this connection it is interesting to note that in May, 1924, when the 700 th anniversary of the University of Naples, a \nUniversity founded by Emperor Frederick II, was celebrated, a crown was found near the sarcophagus of the Emperor in the \nCathedral of Palermo with the following inscription: \n\n‘Seinem Kaiser und Helden \nDas geheime Deutschland. ’ \n\n(‘To Their Emperor and Hero, from Secret Germany ’) ” \n\nPaul Winkler^dh \n\n\nAfter World War Two had ended, the Nazis seemed to have developed a considerable skill and talent for appearing in some very \nunlikely places doing very unlikely things with some very unlikely people. \n\nConsider, for example, the statement made by famous UFO abductee Barney Hill under hypnosis to his psychiatrist Benjamin \nSimon: \n\n“BARNEY \n\n(He takes care to be extremely precise.) \n\nThere was a row of windows. A huge row of windows. Only divided by \nstruts — or structures that prevented it from being one solid window. Or \nthen — it would have been one solid window. And the evil face on the — \n\n(He starts to say “leader.”) \n\nHe looks like a German Nazi. He’s a Nazi...” \n\n(There is a questioning tone in his voice.) \n\nDOCTOR \n\n“He’s a Nazi. Did he have a uniform?” \n\nBARNEY “Yes.” \n\nDOCTOR \n\n“What kind of uniform?” \n\nBARNEY \n\n“He had a black scarf around his neck, dangling over his left \nshoulder.”— \n\nThen there was Jack Ruby’s odd statement on who was behind the \n\nThe old war lords are going to come back. (South America) is \npeople that would do such a thing... that would have to be the \n\n\nKennedy assassination, also allegedly made under hypnosis: \n\nfull of these Nazis!...They will know that is only one kind of \nNazis and that is who is in power. — \n\n\n\nStrangely enough, Ruby, by fingering both South America and Nazis, had his finger on an aspect of the Kennedy assassination that \nfew suspected: surviving Nazi communities in South America and their ongoing quasi-independent existence. \n\n\n\nA. J.F.K’s Policies \n\n\nRegardless of whether one agreed or disagreed with his politics, President John F. Kennedy managed during his short term in \noffice to outline policies that clearly threatened a number of well-entrenched and very powerful interests, interests that many believe \nto comprise elements of America’s “Establishment” or “secret government”. Kennedy had, for example, circulated a national \nsecurity memorandum after the Bay of Pigs fiasco that effectively turned all paramilitary and covert operations over to the Pentagon, \nwresting it from the CIA. He had vowed to “smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.” For those people like Allen Dulles or General \nCharles Peare Cabell — whose appearance in the MAJIC-12 documents we noted in the previous chapter — Kennedy was taking a \ndirect aim at the fiefdoms of bureaucratic power that they had nurtured since the end of World War Two. And with the \nmemorandum, he had scored a direct hit. \n\nAnd, after one of the America’s most closely contested elections, Kennedy had won by a narrow margin over Republican \nincumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Many maintain that Kennedy won because key counties across the country, like \nChicago’s notoriously corrupt Cook county in Illinois, were “delivered” to the Kennedy column by then Mayor Richard Daly and \nvarious Mafia contacts. It was a story that was claimed for other hotly contested counties. After assuming office. President Kennedy \nappointed his brother Robert to be Attorney General, and the Kennedy Administration began to go after organized crime. And with \nbrother Robert heading the Justice Department, yet another powerful enemy was gained besides the intelligence community and \norganized crime. That enemy was J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, a man who in the quiet circles of party-going power in \nWashington, D.C., made no secret of his hatred of the Kennedy administration. \n\nAt this point, it is worth pausing to note that of these three potential enemies, two of them would exercise extraordinary influence \nover the post-assassination Warren Commission, for Allen Dulles, former head of the CIA and dismissed by Kennedy after the Bay \nof Pigs, would of course become a prominent member of the Commission, doubtless thereby insuring that any CIA connections \nwere buried or at the very minimum, obfuscated in a word-spin of confusion. The other enemy that figured prominently in the \noutcome of the Commission was, of course, J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI, which exercised inordinate influence over the flow of \ninformation and data to the Commission. \n\nAs was seen in the previous chapter, however, there are MAJIC- 12 documents which — if one accepts their genuineness for the \nsake of argument — also indicate that Kennedy wanted to internationalize space jointly with the Soviet Union. If one assumes the \nexistence of some covert aspect to either or both of the two countries’ space programs, then this too, would have threatened a good \nmany hidden agendas and entrenched power interests. And in this connection, long before any of the MAJIC-12 documents — \nwhether genuine or not — ever surfaced to see the light of day, the Torbitt document drew its own conclusions about to the space \nprogram and a network of highly placed Nazis within NASA. For the Torbitt document, Von Braun’s control of the Defense \nIndustrial Security Command (D.I.S.C.) becomes a symbol of this network of Paperclip scientists, connected in turn to other World \nWar Two Fascists such as Ference Nagy, representing the emigre community that had collaborated with the Nazis, and that \nsubsequently fled Eastern Europe and Communist reprisal after the war, and, via the Gehlen Organization, that set up a network of \nfront organizations in Western Europe and the United States. These two groups — the Paperclip scientists and the Fascist emigre \nfronts — in turn were connected to a veritable “Murder Incorporated,” the so-called “Permindex” corporation, a company with many \nof these prominent Fascists, as well as Clay Shaw, on its board of directors. The Torbitt document — long before the Cooper- \nCantwheel MAJIC-12 documents were ever released to, or planted in, the UFOlogy community — makes very clear a connection to \nthe Kennedy assassination quickly brushed aside by most assassination researchers: The Nazis. \n\nBut there is a final potential Kennedy enemy to consider. In June of 1963, the same year as his assassination, Kennedy took aim at \none of the most powerful of the “entrenched interests” of the Establishment: international mercantile banking. President Kennedy \nauthorized the printing of approximately four billion dollars of United States Notes and their release for circulation, thereby entirely \nbypassing the privately-owned Federal Reserve Bank, established by subterfuge and calculated political manipulation after the \nnotorious secret Jekyll Island meeting. Kennedy’s move clearly portended an end to the bankers’ monopolistic hold over the nation’s \nmoney supply and a return to “constitutional money,” money entirely free of interest to private banks. This aspect of the \nassassination conspiracy is even less well-known than the Nazi connection, and remains so. \n\nCareful consideration of the disparate groups connected with the assassination — the military-industrial complex, the “national \nsecurity ‘community’” represented by the CIA, FBI and other agencies, the space program, the Mafia, the military, right-wing \nemigre groups represented by various anti-Castro Cuban fronts as well as the Eastern Europeans, and international corporate finance \nand banking - will indicate many connections between all these elements, as many assassination researchers have pointed out. But \nthere is one group with connections to all of these organized interests, and that, of course, is the Nazis. \n\n\n\nB. Mae Brussell on Nazis and JFK \n\n\n\n1. Her Thesis \n\n\nThe late Mae Brussell, well-known conspiriologist and radio talk-show host, was never one to leave a stone unturned. Once \nhaving learned of the Torbitt document and its contents, Brussell did what she normally did when confronted by the allegation of \ndeep conspiracy: she began putting the pieces together and carefully documenting her sources. \n\nHer statement of Nazi involvement in the assassination at some high level takes account of these “other players” in the overall \nscheme: \n\nThis is a story of how key Nazis, even as the Wehrmacht was still on the offensive, anticipated military disaster and laid plans \nto transplant Nazism, intact but disguised, in havens in the West. It is the story of how honorable men, and some not so \nhonorable, were so blinded by the Red menace that they fell into lockstep with Nazi designs. It is the story of the Odd Couple \nPlus One: the mob, the CIA, and fanatical exiles, each with its own reason for gunning for Kennedy. It is a story that climaxes \nin Dallas on November 22, 1963, when John Kennedy was struck down. And it is a story with an aftermath — America’s slide \nto the brink of fascism.— \n\nKennedy was gunned down, in other words, by the well-known “coalescence of interests,” which, on Brussell’s view, included the \nNazis as very secretive players. But Brussell’s statement hints at something more: a coup d’etat with an increasingly fascist face. \nThis “fascist face” will become more and more visible as one considers the details of Brussell’s research, which in turn, exposes a \npossible motivation for Nazi involvement in a conspiracy of “coalescing interests.” \n\n\n2. Germans and Atsugi AFB, Japan: An Oswald Nazi Link \n\n\nLee Harvey Oswald. \n\nSay the name and most people think immediately of the assassin, or at least, of the fallguy, in the Kennedy murder. \n\nFewer people will think of an apparently ordinary American man, with an ordinary background, who became a Marine, and then \nbegan to exhibit bizarre if not extraordinary political beliefs for a soldier, much less a Marine. \n\nEven fewer people still will think of those bizarre behaviors and political beliefs in connection with Oswald’s known connections \nto the FBI, and conclude (in my opinion correctly) that Oswald’s bizarre display of pro-Marxist political beliefs while a Marine at the \nsecret Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan were part of a pattern of sheep-dipping him. Oswald, in spite of these openly professed \nbeliefs, had certain security clearances at the secret radar base at the airfield, and was learning Russian as well. \n\nAnd there is one more thing, also well-known to most assassination researchers: Atsugi Air Base was where the CIA’s U- 2 \nflights over the Soviet Union originated. \n\nAs is well-known to many people, Oswald subsequently concocted a “family emergency” to tend to his sick mother, Marguerite \nOswald, in order to be discharged from the Marines. After leaving the Marines, however, Oswald then traveled to the Soviet Union, \nwhere he then defected. He was placed in Minsk, Byelorussia (White Russia), in a television factory, and was given, by Soviet \nstandards, a spacious apartment. He met and eventually married Marina Oswald, the daughter of a Soviet military intelligence \ncolonel. \n\nMany assassination researchers believe that Oswald fed the Soviets radar and other technical data which led to the shooting down \nof Francis Gary Powers’ U-2 later the same year. Of course, the U-2 was flown out of Atsugi AFB in Japan. Since the U-2 flights \nwere CIA operations and not Air Force operations, this means that the CIA had a secret base at the Atsugi compound. More about \nthis in a moment. \n\nThen, unbelievably, Oswald was allowed to re-defect to the USA, along with his Russian wife — no mean feat in those days — \nwhere his subsequent movements and connections are more or less well-known. \n\nBut what many people do not know is that Oswald, in addition to his connections to extremist left-wing beliefs and organizations, \nalso had some very peculiar connections to extremist right wing people and organizations. One of them, unbelievably, is to the \nemigre-and-spy networks of none other than former Wehrmacht general Reinhard Gehlen. \n\nWhen (Allen) Dulles spoke, Gehlen listened. The CIA chief ws convinced, along with his brother, Secretary of State John \nFoster Dulles, that the “captive nations” of the Soviet bloc would rise up if given sufficient encouragement. At his behest, \nGehlen recruited and trained an exile mercenary force ready to rush in without involving American units. Also at Dulles’ \ndirection, Gehlen tapped the ranks of his wartime Russian collaborators for a cadre of spies to be parachuted into the Soviet \nUnion. Some of these spies were schooled at the CIA’s clandestine base at Atsugi, Japan, where, in 1957, a young Marine \nnamed Lee Harvey Oswald was posted to the U-2 spy plane operation there. — \n\nWhile not establishing a direct connection to the Nazis, this is but one bit of information in a pattern of associations surrounding the \nassassination that Bmssell uncovers. \n\n\n3. Gehlen and the Russian Orthodox Diaspora \n\n\nYet another piece in the assassination puzzle was the connection of Gehlen’s “Organization” with the emigre communities of \nEastern Europeans in this country: \n\nGehlen pioneered the setting up of dummy fronts and cover companies to support his farflung covert operations. A major \nproject was to form Eastern European emigre groups in the U.S. that could be used against the Soviets. Both the Tolstoy \nFoundation and the Union of Bishops of the Orthodox Church Outside Russia were funded by the CIA. Lee and Marina \nOswald arrived from the Soviet Union in June, 1962. They were befriended by some three dozen White Russians in the Dallas- \nFt. Worth area. Many had identifiable Nazi links; others were in the oil and defense industries. It was an improbable social set \nfor a defector to the U.S.S.R. and his wife from Minsk.— \n\nIn any case, it is clear that, via Oswald and similar people, Dulles’ CIA was playing a very dangerous game with two very \ndangerous elements — the Soviets and Gehlen’s own organization of “former” Nazis — that were implacable enemies of each other \nand, in turn, at root enemies of America as well. The intention of using the BND is clear: if the operation of training emigres at \nAtsugi and elsewhere was exposed, American involvement could be “plausibly denied.” Gehlen’s Organization is thus the cut-out \nfor the operation. As will be seen subsequently in this chapter, however, “cutouts” can quickly become semi- or even completely \nindependent of their ostensible “controllers” and become, in effect, Trojan Horses. \n\n\na. Implication: The Infiltration of US Intelligence and Defense \n\n\nIt is worth pausing to consider again the implication of Operation Paperclip and the similar operation that led to the establishment \nof the Gehlen Organization with its numerous East European emigre front organizations. From one point of view, that of the U.S. \nmilitary-industrial-intelligence complex itself, the U.S. was still in the driver’s seat, controlling these two groups and directing their \nactivities. Even in the case of the Nazi rocket scientists in the space program and their counterparts in the defense industries, these \nmen can be considered “cutouts,” fall guys to take the blame in case something goes wrong, and to insulate the bureaucracies of the \nEstablishment from blame in case they did fail. \n\nBut from the point of view of the “cutouts” themselves, they are infiltrators, “users” of the host country’s protection and economic \npower. Such a view, however, can only be reasonably sustained if one detects patterns of behavior on the part of the cutouts that \nwould indicate independence from their “controllers,” for such independence would indicate a measure of underlying, though \nhidden, organization on their part. As will be seen, there are indicators that this is the case, and from within the space program itself. \n\n\nh. Nazis and “the Rogue Element ” In US Intelligence \n\n\nVarious conspiracy researchers— have pointed out that there seems to be some “rogue” element within the American (and to a \nlesser extent, other nations’) intelligence services, acting on its own and often counter to its host nation’s national interest, and \nfollowing its own more-often-than-not murky agenda. Others have pointed out that the recent spate of terrorism has to have, at some \npoint, major financial backing and the backing of some major world power. Still others have even hinted of the historical connection \nof Nazism to militant Islam and to the roots of other terrorist groups.— In any case, a surviving and organized network of \ninternational Fascism would certainly fit the requirements for all these, though, of course, beyond the historically known \nconnections, the case is speculative. \n\n\n4. Schacht-Onassis \n\n\nBut while the case for a “Nazi International” being the oftdicussed “rogue element” within intelligence is only tenuous and \nspeculative, the case for its deeply hidden and high-level connections to the JFK assassination becomes stronger the closer one looks. \nConsider only the fact that Hitler’s financial wizard, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, former President of the Reichsbank, and father-in-law to \nSS Commando Otto Skorzeny, was subsequently “on the payroll of Aristotle Onassis.”— \n\nWe all know who subsequently married Aristotle Onassis, and who strictly refused to talk about what she knew about the murder \nof her husband. We all know she died relatively recently, still as poised and beautiful as ever, and gave strict instructions that her \nprivate diaries were not to be released until long in the future: \n\nJacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. \n\nWhat we never knew, is that by marrying Onassis, Jackie had married into a family of organized crime with its own set of very \nstrange, very Nazi, connections dating from World War Two. \n\nAnd what of Otto Skorzeny? \n\nSkorzeny survived the war, helped direct the notorious O.D.E.S.S.A. organization (Organization der Ehemalige SS Angehorige, \nor “Organization of Former SS Members), and established the ’’Internationale Fascista” in Madrid, Spain, in the same building as \nwas occupied by Spanish Intelligence, and by the Madrid section of the CIA! \n\n\n5. Dulles and McCloy on the Warren Commission \n\n\nWeirder still were some of the people chosen to be on the Warren Commission, two of whom can only be viewed with extreme \nsuspicion. \n\nOne of them, former CIA director Allen Dulles, has already been mentioned. Dulles, of course, was OSS station chief in Zurich, \nSwitzerland, during the war, and helped negotiate the secret deal with General Reinhard Gehlen, and one can only assume, other \nsecret “deals” with Nazi bigwigs, perhaps including Martin Bormann and SS Obergruppenfiihrer Hans Kammler themselves. Dulles \nwill be encountered again later in this chapter, for we have yet to consider what he was up to before World War Two. Dulles as a \nmember of the Warren Commission is perhaps the best example of the post-assassination spin network’s ability to undo the \n“damage” caused by the Kennedy Administration, for Dulles was of course fired by Kennedy for his role in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. \n\nWe do know what another prominent member of the Warren Commission was up to before the war: John J. McCloy. For those \nwho may have forgotten, John J. McCloy was the post-war American High Commissioner for (West) Germany, and was responsible \nfor pardoning many Nazis from their war crimes sentences in order to expedite their extradition to the U.S.A. and their use in \nOperation Paperclip and similar projects. \n\nBut before the war John J. McCloy was so highly placed, so “in” on the “inside track,” that he managed to share a box with Adolf \nHitler at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in what may have been his first television appearance. But why such high honors for an \nAmerican lawyer? This is in part because he was an attorney for the German chemical cartel I.G. Farben before the war. \n\n\n\n6. A Review \n\n\nJust in case it was missed, a review is in order: \n\nOne Warren Commission member was post-war U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, pardoned numerous Nazis, had \npersonally met Adolf Hitler, and legally represented German chemical-industrial giant I.G. Farben before the war: John J. McCloy. \n\nOne Warren Commission member had been fired by President Kennedy for his role in the Bay of Pigs, had been Director of the \nCIA, was OSS station chief in Zurich during the war, and had negotiated the secret deal between German military intelligence gum \nGeneral Reinhard Gehlen, as was as possible other secret deals between “surrendering” Nazis and the U.S.A.: Allen Dulles. \n\nBut during the period that Dulles was still well-ensconced in the CIA, U.S. Marine Lee Oswald was stationed at Atsugi Air Force \nBase in Japan, where, in spite of his openly professed Marxism and “admiration” for the Soviet Union, he was given security \nclearances to relatively sensitive radar data connected with the CIA’s U-2 flights over Russia. Additionally, since Atsugi AFB was \nhome to the secret U-2 flights over the Soviet Union, it therefore had to have a secret CIA base hidden within the Air Force Base. \nGeneral Reinhard Gehlen’s West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Security Service) was apparently training foreign \nemigres as a paramilitary force to be dropped into the Soviet Union. Part of this training would doubtless have been in Russian, and \npart would have included knowledge of Communist doctrine, party organization, and how to “pass oneself off’ as a committed \nCommunist. This means that Oswald, if in fact he was being “sheep dipped” for an intelligence assignment in the Soviet Union, as \nGarrison himself believed, was likely being trained for the role by Gehlen’s Organization and by former Nazis! In other words, all \nthe elements converge at Atsugi, and in the person of Lee Harvey Oswald. \n\nIn this connection it will be shown later that Oswald’s “address book” contained more than just the addresses of FBI agents.... \n\n\n\n7. South American Death Squads: The “Kinder , Gentler Gestapo ’’for Hire \n\n\nHaving reviewed the Nazi situation, we are now in a better position to consider other details presented by Brussell, details that \nbegin to hint of what the Nazi motivation and role may have been, in addition to all the other groups and their individual reasons for \nplaying a role in the assassination might have been. \n\nWhen Brussell wrote her assassination piece for Larry Flint’s The Rebel magazine on the twentieth anniversary of the \nassassination in 1983, she referred to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report entitled “Latin America: Murder Inc.,” a report \nthat she noted was “still classified” at the time of her article.— \n\nBrussell indicated that the report stated that the U.S.A.’s intelligence community had “joint operations” with Argentina, Bolivia, \nBrazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay,” known as “Operation Condor.” Brussell then explains the possible significance of the code \nname by citing a paragraph from a Jack Anderson column: \n\nJack Anderson gave a few details in his column “Operation Condor, An Unholy Alliance,” August 3, 1979: \n\n“Assassination teams are centered in Chile. This international consortium is located in Colonia Dignidad, Chile. Founded by \nNazis from Hitler’s SS, headed by Franz Pfeiffer Richter, Adolf Hitler’s 1000-year Reich may not have perished.” \n\nBrussell then explains the historical connection of Operation Condor to these Nazi-trained and based South American Death squads: \n\nOtto Skorzeny code-named his assault on American soldiers in the Battle of the Bulge Operation Greif, the “Condor.” He \ncontinued Condor with his post-war special teams that imposed “sanctions,” meaning the assassination of enemies. \n\nAnd lest one forget, Brussell reminds her readers of the serpents’ nest of connections Skorzeny unlocks: \n\nSkorzeny’s father-in-law was Hjalmar Schacht, president of Hitler’s Reichsbank. Schacht guided Onassis’ shipyards in \nrebuilding the German and Japanese war fleets. In 1950 Onassis signed on Lars Anderson for his whaling ships on the hunt of \nAntarctica and Argentina. Anderson had belonged to Vidkum Quisling’s Nazi collaborationist group in Norway during the \nwar. Clay Shaw, who was charged by New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison with complicity in the JFK assassination, was a close \nfriend of Hjalmar Schacht.— \n\nThis presents a very interesting, very nasty, picture. \n\nOne can assume, once again, that the U.S. intelligence community’s involvement with such groups as Colonia Dignidad was to \nuse them as “cut-outs”, accomplishing the necessary political assassination when necessary, and achieving “plausible deniability” \nwhen something went wrong. After all, who would believe that such an extensive network of Nazis still existed so long after the \nwar? And who would believe that the American intelligence community was in cahoots with it? That was, after all, 1983, almost \nforty years after the end of the war. Who would believe that there were still Nazis well-enough organized and well-enough financed \nto run such South American continent-spanning covert operations? Who would believe that they were still even ideologically \ncommitted to Nazism after such a long period? \n\nBut again, Jack Anderson’s and Mae Brussell’s picture presents yet another disturbing picture: one not only of such continued \nNazi existence, but of its continued semi- or complete independence from the control of the U.S. or any Latin American government. \nIndeed, it would have been relatively easy for such professionally trained assassins to keep their own records and proofs of \nconnections with these countries’ intelligence services and governments to organized crime and murder and Latin America. In short, \nit would be a very easy thing for such independent Nazi colonies to blackmail their so-called masters with the threat of exposure. \n\n\n8. George De Mohrenschildt \n\n\nWhen “Marxist” and Soviet defector Lee Harvey Oswald returned to the United States with Russian wife Marina in tow, he \nbegan to associate with some very un -Marxist and un -Communist characters, like East European emigrant and Texas oil geology \nbusinessman George DeMohrenschildt. DeMohrenschildt was unusual company for the supposedly poor Oswald to be running \nwith, and he soon introduced Lee Harvey to Dallas’ White Russian and “tsarist” community, where he and Marina were befriended \nby Ruth and Michael Paine. \n\nThe Paines assisted Lee Harvey in obtaining his job at the Texas School Book Depository and he and Marina stayed with the \nPaines in their home. \n\nThis is all highly unusual, for of course, as has already been mentioned, Lee's wife Marina was the daughter of a colonel in the \nSoviet Union’s military intelligence, the GRU, while Lee Harvey was, of course, supposedly a pro-Marxist defector to the Soviet \nUnion who had achieved the impossible and “defected back” to the U.S.A. with a Russian wife! \n\n\n\n9. The Paines, The Oswalds, and General Dornberger \n\n\nMichael Paine took an extraordinary risk with this behavior towards the Oswalds, for he worked for Bell Aircraft in connection to \nthe Defense Department, in a position that required him to have a top security clearance.— Or perhaps it was not really a risk. \nPerhaps the Paines were being used to shepherd an already comprised Oswald into his final position. \n\nAs for DeMohrenschildt, who was accused of being a Nazi spy, he perished of a fatal gunshot wound, allegedly a suicide, the day \nthat the House Select Committee on Assassinations came looking for him.— \n\n\n10. Martin Bormann and JFK \n\n\nMany assassination researchers have pointed out that when he was arrested, Lee Harvey Oswald’s notebook contained the \naddresses of some very strange people for a “lone nut assassin” to be carrying around, people that included FBI agents among \nothers. Other assassination researchers have pointed out that Oswald’s “Marxist” connections have all the signatures of someone \nbeing prepared for a role, in this case, role of “defector.” \n\nHowever, with so many strange Nazi connections lurking in the background, surely somewhere along the long line of murder and \n“coincidental deaths” that followed the assassination the media would have uncovered something about it and published it. Yet, of \nthe Nazi connection there has been next to nothing, and of the Nazi Connection in Oswald’s notebook, absolutely nothing was said \nby the major American media. \n\nYet, in 1976, a relatively popular book was published by then well-known investigative journalist Sybil Leek and Bert Sugar \ncalled The Assassination Chain, which had a foreward by none the less than famous syndicated columnist Jack Anderson. The book \ncontained the following bit of information in a chapter called “the Right-Wing Extremist Scenario:” \n\nWhen Oswald was arrested, the FBI found his address book, and in it were the addresses of Major General Walker and George \nLincoln Rockwell. These improbable names only add to the confusion of other addresses such as that of FBI Agent Hosty, \nwhose conncection with Oswald has never been cleared up.— \n\nOswald was, of course, accused of trying to assassinate Major General Edwin Walker. But this would hardly explain Agent Hosty’s \npresence in the address book, unless Oswald was either planning to assassinate him, or if General Walker’s true role was something \nother than we have been told. \n\nBut in any case, the real figure of interest is of course George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party. This \nseems so incongruously out of place as to be ridiculous, unless one recalls Brussell's allegations concerning the CIA’s secret U-2 \nbase at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan, where Oswald was stationed, and where, according to Brussell, Reinhard Gehlen’s \n“Organization” was recruiting and training paramilitary agents for covert operations inside the Soviet Union. \n\nBut why not say something about it? Surely the address of the leader of the American Nazi Party would have cinched the case \nthat Oswald was a “lone nut”! But one would not say something about it if in fact the connection was real, and revealed something \nabout Oswald and the conspiracy to assassinate the president. \n\nIf, in other words, Oswald was being sheep-dipped for precisely this sort of operation — which his “defection” to the Soviet \nUnion has every appearance of being — then it was a group of former Nazis that were doing it, ostensibly for the CIA, but possibly \nfor their own purposes as well. \n\nIn this regard, there does exist evidence that Oswald was exposed to precisely some sort of German connection while in Japan. In \none of the most bizarre assassination theory books to appear, author Lincoln Lawrence’s Were We Controlled? makes the following \npoint from the testimony of one of Oswald’s Marine buddies to the Warren Commission, one Nelson Delgado, while they were both \nstationed in California. \n\nIn his testimony, Nelson Delgado offers these startling thoughts for us to ponder on... Delgado: “Well, like I say, he tried to \nteach me Russian, but then another time, I had some thought that what he was speaking to me was German.” And then later in \nthe same testimony... Liebeler: “It seemed to you like it was German?” Delgado: “Like German, yes.” Still later, “I could only \nassume it was Jewish, or German and later on when I was in Germany, I think... I am pretty sure... it was German that he was \nspeaking.” At another point in the questioning, Delgado (by his own testimony, Oswald’s closest friend in the Marine Corps) \nwas askied if he had met Oswald at any time when he (Delgado) was in Germany. Delgado: “No, I wanted to... I knew that he \nwas over there and going to school...”— \n\nWhat the alleged assassin of President Kennedy was doing with the address of the American Nazi Party Leader George Lincoln \nRockwell in his notebook no one ever seems to want to discuss. Nor does anyone in the American media seem to want to inquire as \nto where Lee Harvey Oswald might have learned German along the way to his defection to the Soviet Union and his stay in the \ncapital of Byelorussia: Minsk. Mae Brussell alone, in all the American media since the assassination, has intimated where: the \nGehlenorg’s operation at Atsugi AFB in Japan, preparing, at the behest of Allen Dulles, for covert operations inside the USSR. \n\nSome sort of German connection is there, and in the Warren Commission’s own testimony to boot. \n\nBut if the American media was silent about this aspect of the assassination, the European media was not. As Brussell indicates, \n\nIn August 1971, a French paper headlined a news story, “Martin Bormann behind the Kennedy murders.” It listed an \n\n\ninternational band of killers that was located in Texas. They carried out the two assassinations at the German command. \n\nSix years later, June 8, 1977, the London Guardian reported, “Bormann Linked with Kennedy Murder.” This story was \nbased on a new book titled Treason for My Daily Bread by Mikhail Lebedev. \n\nLebedev detailed how Martin Bormann left Europe, established his current life in Paraguay, and how the fatal head shot to \nKennedy was delivered by an agent paid by Bormann, alias of Zed.— \n\nAs Brussell points out, these allegations of Nazi connections — known since the Torbitt document was discretely circulated in 1971 \n— and publicly known since Lebedev’s book, and for that matter, Leek and Sugar’s The Assassination Chain, both appeared while \nthe House Select Committee on Assassinations was conducting its investigations to “find the truth.” Yet, the Nazi aspect of the story \nwas the one subject that the Committee’s Chief Consul, G. Robert Blakey, would never countenance, refusing “to admit any \nresearch or documents on these subjects.”— \n\nIn other words, one may speak of possible CIA involvement, of possible Mafia involvement, of the possible involvement of a \ndisgruntled group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, even of the possible involvement of disenchanted elements within the CIA and the \nAmerican military, in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But of the possible involvement of Nazis, one may never \nspeak. \n\n\n11. The “Octopus ” Before the “Octopus the Bunge Corporation Beats Danny Casolaro by Two Decades \n\n\nBut assuming that there was Nazi involvement in the Kennedy assassination, what was its motivation? That international bankers \nwould have had motivations, in the retrospective of Kennedy’s intention to bypass the Federal Reserve and authorize the printing \nand circulation of United States notes, seems clear enough. That the Mafia had its own motivations is also equally clear. After all, the \nMafia had helped elect the Kennedy Administration, and suddenly it found itself confronted by a hostile Justice Department under \nAttorney General Robert Kennedy. The Anti-Castro Cubans had motivation, since Kennedy clearly had undertaken private \ncommitments with the Soviet Union not to invade nor to sponsor covert operations designed to overthrow Castro. One may even see \nin the Anti-Castro forces a motivation for the similar involvement of at least the crypto-Nazi Eastern European emigre groups, such \nas the White Russian community in Dallas, to which Oswald was introduced by DeMohrenschildt. Such groups would have been \nlow-level players, helping in the detail work to position the major players and cut-outs - people like Oswald himself — in their \nrespective positions. Their motivation would have been clear: after the Bay of Pigs and Kennedy’s “betrayal” of the Cuban emigre \ncommunity, he had signaled clearly his opposition to the CIA’s and military’s “rollback” policy towards Communism, a policy that \ndepended on these emigre fronts to fight proxy “wars of liberation” from their Communist masters. \n\nEvery one of the major alleged players in the assassination conspiracy has a clear and plausible motive for being there. \n\nExcept for the Nazis. \n\nTheir motivations seem obscure at best, since they seem cloaked behind all the other groups, at the very highest level, like the \ninternational bankers themselves, who would clearly have felt threatened by Kennedy’s purpose to by-pass the Federal Reserve and \ncreate debt-free money. But even here, one can sense the high mystery. That there are strange, if not downright bizarre, connections \nto Nazis in the assassination should now be clear, yet, unlike even international banking, the Nazis seem to have no interest \nwhatsoever for involvement. Once again, one is back to the question of motivations. \n\nBut therein also lies, perhaps, the key to their involvement, and their motivations. For if they lie hidden behind all these other \ngroups, if in fact they — intended as a final deep cover “cut-out” layer — became the ultimate controllers who gave the final “go” \norder, as the European newspaper reports suggest by naming Bormann himself as the decision-maker, then one may speculate on \ntheir motivations. \n\nClearly, to undertake such drastic action, one of two things, or a combination of both, would have had to be present: (1) Some \npolicy or policies of President Kennedy was perceived as a threat to their interests; and/or (2) some advantage had to be gained by \nhis elimination. As I shall argue below, if there is Nazi involvement, then I believe some combination of both is behind it. \n\nAgain, Mae Brussell is the first prominent media personality to mention the tip of a German iceberg that may be the first clue to \nunraveling the mystery of Nazi involvement, and the even greater mystery of its motivations for such a hideous act. Discovering \nLincoln Lawrence’s book Were We Controlled?— Brussell begins to follow the only big money trail known to exist in connection \nwith the assassination: \n\nThe stock market dropped 24 points in 27 minutes when news of President Kennedy’s assassination was announced. 2.6 \nmillion shares were sold off. It was the greatest panic since 1929. Somebody made a huge profit selling short in many markets. \nSomebody made half a billion dollars in one day.— \n\nThat somebody, according to Lincoln Lawrence, was Bunge and Bom, LDA, or simply, the Bunge Corporation. The same day, \nanother company’s stock, crashed: the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation. The crash helped further drive the market \ndown. \n\nBefore considering Lincoln Lawrence’s presentation of the Bunge Corporation’s activities on the week prior to the assassination, \nit is worth pausing to consider Brussell’s own statements of Bunge’s extent and influence. \n\nAllied Crude was controlled by U.S. American Bunge Corporation and financially controlled by a group of share-holders \nheadquartered in Argentina known as “Bunge and Bom, LDA.: \n\nBusiness Week of October 19, 1963, one month before the Kennedy assassination, described the Bom family in Argentina, \nthe biggest shareholders for Bunge, as being from Europe, specifically Germany. \n\nEverything about Bunge has German influence. They have $2 billion annual business in 80 countries. There are over 110 \noffices, all linked by Telex and under-the-ocean telegraph channels. The Bunge Corporation is referred to as “the Octopus.”— \n\nSo what, exactly, is the connection between Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining, its crash, the Bunge Corporation, and the \nKennedy assassination? \n\nNoting that the massive short-selling that occurred on Nov. 22, 1963, had been prepared well in advance, Lincoln Lawrence, in \n\n\nhis little known classic on the Kennedy Assassination, Were We Controlled ?, gives the following speculative outline of its \nconnections and motivations: \n\nA small group of hard-as-steel international criminals (with German-Argentine intellectual and scientific backgrounds) carefully \ncalculated that: \n\nThe coincidence of the assassination of a President of the United States... and the simultaneous scandalizing and collapse of \nthe commodities market... would rapidly drive the stock market down at least 30 points! \n\nHaving advance knowledge of this event... the group would sell short on a heavily financed scale... and a profit of perhaps a \nhalfbillion dollars would be divided amongst its members.— \n\nHow all this happened was through careful and very well-though-out long term manipulation of a man named Tino DeAngelis and \nhis Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation. \n\nDeAngelis, according to Lawrence, first came to the attention of the financial group behind the Bunge Corporation in 1954, when \nin the process of contacts with the West German government, he announced his plans to found a company that would refine edible \nvegetable oils. In 1955, the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation was founded by DeAngelis and 20 of his most trusted \nfriends in Bayonne, New Jersey.— \n\nAlthough it was the last thing that he could have foreseen, the formation of Allied fitted The Group’s plans and led inevitably to \nhis complete financial ruin — and their profit! \n\nIf for a second, you find it hard to believe that a small group operating out of a German headquarters could find it sufficiently \nprofitable to plot the long term expansion and deflation of a financial bubble fathered by a Bronx butcher with dreams of glory, \nthink again.— \n\nThe Bunge Corporation was chosen, according to Lawrence, to be tied to Allied Crude simply because Bunge’s world-wide and \nvirtually instantaneous communications network, which rivaled that of many large governments, was perfect for the sort of minute- \nby-minute and second-by-second manipulation of the commodities market their scheme required.— \n\nThus, the fate of Bunge and Allied Crude — known to the Group but unknown to the luckless DeAngelis — was wedded in a \nlong term scheme: \n\n(The Bunge Corporation’s) good will was essential to the business destiny of Allied! \n\nOf the fifty-one companies which either lent money to Allied or deposited oil at its Bayonne plant against warehouse \nreceipts, the Bunge Corporation was the one most critically attached to its fate. \n\nWhen Allied’s ship of destiny was steered into the deep waters, as indeed it was by an amazing series of maneuvers, only \none collision was needed to sink it instantly to the bottom. A collision with Bunge Corporation would suffice... creating a \ndisaster that would take with it the investment of the other fifty companies.— \n\nHow was DeAngelis’ collapse engineered? \n\nLawrence answers by stating that Bunge’s role apparently was to feed DeAngelis’ ambitions, no matter what. “Bunge used its \nown money to finance DeAngelis instead of resorting to bank loans.” — Someone at Bunge wanted very much for De Angelis to \nsucceed, or rather, to appear to succeed: \n\nGoing even further in its paternal interest in De Angelis’ business affairs, Bunge allowed De Angelis to really take off into \nfinancial outer space... by pledging at one point as much as thirty-eight shares of the hundred odd shares of Allied stock and \nother De Angelis stock for huge loans. Someone in B unge supported him in his efforts to play king. Others, like Karl \nGroenfeld, Senior Traffic Manager for Bunge, were suspicious.— \n\nWith such powerful corporate backing apparently in his comer, DeAngelis could do no wrong, and was refused no financial favor \nby some very prestigious brokerage houses on Wall Street. \n\nIn the summer of 1961, DeAngelis and Allied Crude began to be steered “into a position where his back was to the wall,”— for \nduring that period \n\n$166,000,000 was deposited to Tino’s firm at the First National Bank of North Bergen. \n\nTino was led to believe that he had a sure order from Spain for 275 million pounds of soybean oil! Payment for this would \nhave amounted to thirty-six and a half million dollars! .... \n\n\nSo, of course, began the inevitable build-up of Allied for the big let-down. In his Bayonne tanks, De Angelis had about fifty \nmillion pounds of oil. That left 225 million pounds for Allied to acquire in the future. \n\n\nTino turned to the Chicago Board of Trade, with a supposed Spanish “promise” of eventual payment in American dollars. \n(Were he not controlled, this alone would have alerted him to take a second look at the deal.) Tino started dealing....Allied is \nsaid to have closed over 3,000 separate contracts for 180-million pounds of oil. If the sale to Spain were not consummated, he \nwould have put forth 18 million dollars for these orders. And even a half-cent a pound drop in the futures price (if it occurred \nbefore delivery date) would mean that De Angelis would have to produce almost a million dollars more within twenty-four \nhours to meet the margin regulations of the Exchange. \n\nThe Spanish deal, of course, as it had been controlled from the start... vanished into thin air... leaving Tino sitting on top of \nthe soybean world in an almost insane predicament. — \n\nRecall that Spain was headquarters to Skorzeny’s International Fascista organization, and that Skorzeny was no stranger to financial \nwheeling and dealing, being the son-in-law to former Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht. Was Skorzeny the source of the “deal” \nthat De Angelis considered so certain? Was this the reason, too, that he did not question being paid in American dollars, since he \nknew his “source” was certainly capable of paying in American dollars? \n\nWe will never know, but we do know that De Angelis’ behavior at that point becomes increasingly strange if not tragic. He began \nto buy futures contracts, “not on orders he had for Allied, but supposedly on contracts he might be going to get.”— Since the \n“Spanish deal” and its collapse had already placed De Angelis against the wall, the only way he could purchase these furtures \ncontracts was by issuing phony warehouse receipts for oil stored in his tanks that did not exist!— Using these phony receipts, he \nbegan borrowing money from several brokerage houses for the funds needed to purchase commodities futures. \n\nRecall that Bunge had loaned De Angelis money from its own funds, a process that had been repeated in the years prior to the \n“Spanish deal.” De Angelis approached Bunge for more money in October of 1963 for another loan, and “to his astonishment, \nBunge refused!\"— Bunge had now weakened Allied Crude for the big crash. \n\nDe Angelis attempted to survive a bit longer using check-kiting tactics and more phony warehouse receipts.— \n\nOn the Wednesday afternoon before the assassination, Bunge now moved to eliminate Allied, the very corporation it had helped \nfound and propel to prominence, by informing one holder of the phony warehouse receipts to “be on the alert” about De Angelis.— \nThen, on Thursday November 21 st , 1963, the final trap was laid. \n\nOn Thursday afternoon it was important to the success of the “controllers” that the groundwork for a complete panic of the \nmarket be laid so that on the day of the assassination, Friday, the prices would plummet and the profits reaped by selling short \nwould be insured. \n\nIn considering whether (this scenario) is truth or fantasy, one must note that of the fifty-odd companies that could have \nmoved that day to lift the lid that would light the bomb... the one that did file suit (charging that [one of the warehouse receipt \nholders] had “lost 160,450,000 pounds of oil worth $14,240,000 at Allied through forged orders was not Haupt, not Williston \n& Beane... but the Bunge Corporation!— \n\nAs the news of the assassination of the president reached a stock exchange already concussed by the collapse of Allied Crude, its \nbankruptcy filing, and the suspension of trade of several of De Angelis’ brokerage house financial backers, the market plummeted so \nseverely, in part driven down by massive short selling, that the Board of Governors closed trading at 2:07 p.m., more than eighty \nminutes before its normal closing.— \n\nOne of De Angelis’ and Allied Crude’s major customers, Frederick Hediger of Gamac Grain, was subsequently quoted in Time \nmagazine as “saying that when he heard on the radio that afternoon that ‘Kennedy had been assassinated, I thought this must be a \nplot by the Russians or the underworld — too many crazy things are happening at once.‘“— Even the New York State Attorney \nGeneral thought that it was possible that De Angelis and his Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Company had been “’broken’ in \nthe futures market by someone who sold short and profited on a gigantic scale.”— \n\nThat someone was, according to Fawrence, a group of Germans inside of Bunge corporation, a group of Germans of “intellectual \nand scientific background,” who, on his view, orchestrated the whole scenario for nothing more than massive financial gain. \n\nBack to this in a moment. \n\nWhile there are a number of factors that have not been recounted here — as for example the heavy role of “mind control” in \nFawrence’s speculations that Oswald, De Angelis, and Jack Ruby were all cynically manipulated by this German “Group” for the \nmere purpose of immense financial gain — there are a number of points that would tend to make one discount the whole scenario, \n\n\nthe most basic of which was that the whole thing occurred merely for financial gain. \n\nBut oddly, Lawrence himself hints at, though never again pursues or mentions, that the “group” behind his scenario had \nintellectual and “scientific backgrounds,” hinting in turn that there was possibly a motivation behind that of the motivation of \nfinancial gain. The money was to be used for something, something that, if one carefully reads between the lines of Lawrence’s \nbook, is scientific in nature. Of course, the Bell and similar projects would have required heavy financial outlays. And one would \nhave needed such financial injections for independent projects \n\nOnly when taken in a much wider context of the other major players in the conspiracy and their motivations does Lawrence’s \nscenario not only make sense, but begins to hint at things that would have made Nazi involvement coalesce with the other elements: \nthe Mafia, big business and banking, the military industrial complex, “pissed-off’ emigre groups, and so on. As Lawrence makes \nclear, the sudden coincidence of the collapse of Allied Crude, instigated by Bunge, with the assassination, the heavy round of short \nselling designed ahead of time to occur on that same day, have all the appearance of events being driven by people “in the know.” \nThe events on the stock market during that day have the familiar and dolorous ring of similar stock market events during September \n11, 2001 and its aftermath. As will be seen below, the financial picture and motivation of the assassination begin to connect other \ndots, dots that trace their spider-web-thin and tenuous but still clearly visible threads back to Germany, and World War Two. \n\nWe will return to the subject of possible Nazi involvement and motivations in this bizarre scenario in a later section. But for now, \nthere is one last connection that Mae Brussell exposes. \n\n\n\n12. More Odd Behavior and Connections: West German Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Nixon \n\n\nThe day after the assassination of President Kennedy, right-wing extremist, Major General Edwin Walker called Munich, \nGermany from his home in Shreveport, Louisiana. He called the Munich-based newspaper, the Deutsche National und Soldaten \nZeitung (The German National and Soldiers’ Times), a neo-nazi rag based in Munich. He called to tell them that Lee Harvey \nOswald, the suspect in the assassination, was the same person that had tried to kill him by shooting through his window in April of \n1963. — This is the same General Walker whose address, as mentioned above, was found in Oswald’s address book, along with \nthat of LBI agent James Hosty, and incongruously, that of American Nazi Party leader George Lincoln Rockwell. Conveniently, \n“Marxist” Oswald, having allegedly taken pot shots at Walker, was now accused of shooting and killing president Kennedy. \n\nThe trouble is, as Brussell points out, “there was never one shred of evidence, or a reliable witness, that could make this \nconnection” of Oswald to the General’s would-be (and unsuccessful) assassin.— Thus, as Brussell alleges, it became necessary for \nRuth Paine to deliver a post-dated letter to Marina Oswald from Lee, implicating him in the attempt on General Walker and \nestablishing him as a “lone nut” extremist capable of murdering prominent figures alone and unaided.— \n\nPause and consider what framing Oswald for this act accomplishes, for it kills two birds with one stone. Lirstly, it establishes him \nas a “lone nut”. Secondly, it distances him from his right-wing extremist connections, since he is allegedly shooting at a right-wing \nextremist general. This in turn would make his alleged Marxist beliefs seem more genuine. \n\nBut, asks Bmssel, “Why was General Walker in such a hurry to get his information printed in Germany before anybody in Dallas \never heard about it?” Her answer is, even for Mae Brussell, somewhat unusual \n\nKurt-George Kiesinger had just been installed as Chancellor of West Germany and Lranz-Josef Strauss as finance minister. \n\nKiesinger entered the radio propaganda division of Nazi Loreign Minister (Joachim) Von Ribbentrop at age 36. He was then \ndirecting a world-wide radio propaganda apparatus with 195 specialists under his supervision during the war. He was the \nliaison officer, coordinating his department’s work with that of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.— \n\nIn other words, Brussell is implying that the change in power in West Germany was somehow linked to the assassination, and the \nassumption of power in the United States by Lyndon B. Johnson. But beyond this she does not speculate, and that is, for Mae \nBrussell, decidedly unusual. \n\n\nC. The JFK Connection in Early MAJIC-12 Documents \n\n\nIf the Nazis were involved in the JFK assassination, then, as Lincoln Lawrence’s speculative scenario avers, one motivation of \nthen' involvement was for financing to continue their scientific projects. As for the involvement itself, as was seen in the previous \nchapter, there are some documents in the Cooper-Cantwheel set of MAJIC-12 classified UFO papers that indicate a connection of at \nleast the subject of UFOs to the assassination, via the memorandum addressed to General Charles Peare Cabell, one of the CIA \nbigwigs sacked by Kennedy allegedly for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. \n\nGeneral Cabell also had another connection besides that of the MAJIC-12 group and his CIA association. He was intimately \ninvolved in Operation Paperclip, and his involvement was in connection with bringing over Nazi “aviation doctors.” Lest one forget \nwho these doctors were, these were the ones performing grizzly and barbaric medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners \nto study effects on humans in extreme conditions, including outer space.— \n\nCabell’s brother Earle was mayor of Dallas during the assassination, and was also instrumental in getting the motorcade route \nchanged to make the detour that took Kennedy into the “kill zone” in front of the Texas School Book Depository and the Grassy \nKnoll. But the document itself suggests a technological and policy motive to the assassination may have underwritten at least the \nintelligence community’s involvement in it, namely, the secret development of recovered technology, the public repression of similar \ntechnological development, and the creation of appropriate policies for public manipulation. Kennedy, by threatening to smash the \nCIA, threatened this agenda with exposure, and that meant, in turn, exposure of Paperclip and how deeply corrupted American \nintelligence and defense had become. In short, Kennedy threatened - doubtless inadvertently - the whole continuing Nazi enterprise. \n\nOne may also view this in connection with the Two Space Programs Hypothesis. If indeed Kennedy was serious about limited \ncooperation in space with the Soviets, then this too would have threatened aspects of America’s — and perhaps the Soviets’ own \nversion of the — secret space program with exposure. \n\nAnd finally, what of all the lurking involvement not only of Nazis, but of big oil? Why this strange coalescence? If there was a \ncontinued development of the technology represented by the Bell — and the Bell and its strange effects were very real — then “the \nBrotherhood” would have had a final, crowning, motivation: they would have acted not only to continue the secret development and \nhoarding of such technology for themselves but also to maintain the reliance of everyone else on petroleum, using some of those \nprofits to fund that continued technological development, and the suppression of any open and independent development of such \ntechnology. \n\nSo, if Bunge Corporation pocketed major financial profits from the assassination, then, clearly, this was an after-thought: “If we’re \ngoing to do this to protect our interests, why not make a little money on the affair too?” \n\nIt is in this context that two other MAJIC-12 documents should be viewed: the alleged letter from Cooper’s anonymous source \nindicating that President Nixon had “privatizing” the alleged UFO “study group,” giving credence to the idea that its massive \nintelligence operations and covert technology development, and public technology repression efforts, fell into, if were not originally \nin, independent hands. \n\nSimilarly there are hints in this letter as well as in the burned “Annex C” that not only was President Kennedy eliminated because \nof the threat he posed to this group and its programs, but that Secretary of War James Forrestal was murdered for similar reasons as \nwell. \n\n\n1. Guy Bannister, UFOs, and JFK \n\n\nAs if all this were not enough, there is yet one more strange connection between the Kennedy assassination, UFOs, advanced \ntechnology, and the Nazis. For “one of the men involved in the investigation of UFO reports in the American Northwest (in 1947) \nwas none other than FBI special agent Guy Bannister.”— Not only this, but Bannister — who shared a New Orleans office in 1962 \nwith Lee Harvey Oswald’s “Fair Play for Cuba Committee” — appears to be the real origin of the FBI’s “X Files:” \n\nA look at recently declassified FBI files for that period in 1947 show a number of telexes from Bannister, some with his initials \n“WGB,” all pertaining to UFO phenomena, as well as other FBI documents with the designation “Security Matter - X” or \nsimply “SM-X,” the origin - the author supposes — of the “X Files,” which at least in 1947 did exist at the FBI and was \nconcerned with UFOs... — \n\nIt is, writes author Peter Levenda, “as if reality were layed like an onion, a palimpsest on which numerous events were written over \neach other, all on the same page. In this case, we have Operation Paperclip, UFOs, and the Kennedy assassination all written on the \nsame sheet of onionskin parchment. Nazis, aliens, and political murder.”— For Levenda, the conclusion, disturbing though it may \nbe, is clear: “There is no lack of Nazi influence in and around the events leading up to — and away from — the assassination.”— \n\n\nD. The Magus of Ingolstadt \n\n\nBut where do all these spidery-thin strands lead? What, or who, might be at the center of this web? \n\nOne of the persons surely near the center, as the European newspaper articles cited by Brussell suggest, was Martin Bormann, \nformer Nazi Party Reichsleiter, financial administrator both of the Party’s and Hitler’s own personal fortunes, ever-present shadow to \nthe Fiihrer, and mastermind of the Nazi “strategic evacuation” plans. While not suggesting that Bormann is the only high-ranking \nmember of the decision-making oligarchy that conspired to murder the President, if there is a Nazi involvement, and so many \ndisparate sources suggest there is, then Bormann surely was & member of the planning and decision-making level of that group. \nPerhaps he was its driving force; perhaps he learned of an already existing conspiracy, and in customary Bormann fashion weaseled \nhis way into it, and utilized it for his “Nazi International’s” own interest. \n\nBut in any case, Bormann is a crucial figure, for after the beginning of actual wartime hostilities and Hitler’s ever-growing \npreoccupation with, and meddling in, Germany’s military operations, Bormann was left as the de facto day-to-day ruler of Nazi \nGermany, the gray eminence, the real power behind Hitler’s dark throne. \n\n\n\n1. Bormann and Ingolstadt: A Connection to the Illuminati? \n\n\nTo appreciate Bormann’s significance, it is best to recall that besides his role as party leader and treasurer, he was also an SS \nObergruppenfiihrer. This would make Bormann — like Kammler and Mazuw — a probable member of Himmler’s “initiates” into \nthe SS’s so-called “occult secrets and mysteries.” One has difficulty imagining the pragmatic and cynical Bormann involved in such \nrituals for any other purpose than to placate Himmler, and to keep an eye on his most serious rival for power. \n\nIn spite of this, Bormann, of all the leading Nazis, is the one figure that is the most shrouded in mystery and contradictions. While \nfinding it difficult to believe that Bormann could be anything less than cynical in his approach to Himmler’s fascination with the \noccult — recall that it is because Bormann kept such faithful notes of Hitler’s “table talk” that we know at all that Hitler regarded \nHimmler’s obsession with such things as “nonsense” — it is nonetheless remotely possible that Bormann was a very high initiate \ninto his own secret society affiliations, for he had acquired a home after the Nazi assumption of power, near the town of Ingolstadt, \nwhich remained his legal residence throughout the war. \n\nFor those who do not know the significance of Ingolstadt, it is the birthplace — on May 1, 1776 - of one of the most notorious \nsecret societies in history: the Bavarian Illuminati of Ingolstadt University professor Adam Weishaupt. Given that Bormann’s boss at \nthe time was one Rudolf Hess, a man known to be steeped in and obsessed with occult lore and secret societies of every stripe \nimaginable, it is difficult to believe that Bormann would not have known this aspect of the history of the town he had chosen to \nmake home. \n\n\na. Bormann’s Manipulation of Hitler \n\n\nSome have speculated that Adolf Hitler’s extraordinary power over masses, and his extraordinary charisma and skill as an orator, \ncame from some occult influence in his life. To a certain extent, this is true, for it is known that Hitler did obtain the assistance of \nindividuals, such as the rhetorician Hanussen, trained in the use of gestures to accompany words, a school of rhetoric with its own \noccult and esoteric associations. Beyond this, however, nothing at all is known of Hitler’s initiation into any secret society, though \nmost scholars have speculated upon it.— \n\nIf Hitler’s evident ability to sway the masses of Germany with pageantry and brilliant rhetoric was evidence of any occult \nassociation, however, then Bormann’s evident skill in manipulating Hitler — while seemingly his servant — must be taken as the \nmanipulation of the king by the court magician. \n\nWhat was Bormann’s source of power over the man who held such power over Germany and Europe? One very plausible \nexplanation was given by William Stevenson in his book, The Bormann Brotherhood. \n\nThe Jew as the source of all evil haunted Adolf Hitler, who feared that his own blood was ‘tainted.’ This led to the brutal \nmurder of his niece and mistress (Geli Raubal). The details were lost at the time, for the Nazis were already on the march and \nviolent killings became the order of the day....It was only when Bormann’s disappearance became a matter for serious \nconjecture, and intelligence agents began to go into the ugly details, that an incredible episode in Hitler’s life came to light. This \nexplained exactly how Martin Bormann was able to gather into his hands all the strings required to make Hitler dance to his \ntune.“— \n\n\nLike many others examining the “suicide” of Geli Raubal, Stevenson speculates that Adolf Hitler, in a fit of blind rage after Geli had \nthreatened to expose the fact that his grandmother had bom a child from Baron Rothschild of Vienna,— had killed his niece with a \npistol, and then fled the scene in panic, and appealed to Bormann for Help. Bormann assured his Fiihrer that it would be “taken care \nof’. It had to be, for obviously, a murder investigation of Hitler was a considerable impediment if the Nazis were ever to assume \npower. \n\nAt this point, Bormann begins his rise to power, by somehow persuading the local police investigator of the murder, a man named \nMuller, to cover up the murder in return for favors and advances. And thus was bom an alliance between Martin Bormann and one \nof Nazi Germany’s other “hidden powers” behind the throne, for Muller went on to become the notorious “Gestapo Muller”, making \nthe Gestapo’s extensive files on just about everybody not only available to his immediate boss, the Reichsfiihrer SS Heinrich \nHimmler, but also to Bormann, who thus had up to the minute intelligence on his biggest rival and his entire department of the Nazi \ngovernment. Bormann, in fact, according to Stevenson, had initiated, via Gestapo Muller, no less than four private and discreet \ninvestigations of Hitler’s family lines and his Jewish blood and descent, all without Hitler’s knowledge. The blackmail value that all \nthis information would have had for Bormann was incalculable, and accounts for his ability to draw into his hands “all the strings” to \n\n\nmake Hitler “dance to his tune”. Indeed, Stevenson’s own characterization of Bormann’s role in this regard is oddly reminiscent of \nthe language of another man, writing in the 1920s, long before Hitler came to power. \n\nBut before that, there is something else. Gestapo Muller was directly responsible for the blanket of security belts around SS \nObergruppenfuhrer Hans Kammler’s “think tank” in Prague. — In other words, Bormann, through his friend Gestapo Muller, was \nfaultlessly well-informed about the extent and nature of Nazi secret weapons research. Indeed, he, Bormann, was the real master of it \nall. \n\nBut what of the language of “dancing to a tune”? What man first used such language in association with Nazis? \n\nThe man is senior occultist and member of the Thule Society - the secret society that midwifed the Nazi party into existence — \nDietrich Eckhart, who told his disciples shortly before his death to “Follow Hitler: he will make the world dance, but it is we who \nhave written the tune.” All this marks Bormann as a possible practitioner of the most classic form of occult black magic: the secret \ncontrol and manipulation of weak people (Hitler) through their weaknesses and fears. \n\nAnd Bormann’s own choice of Ingolstadt as a home mirrors perhaps a deeply hidden association of its own, for after World War \nOne, Bormann, like many disenchanted German veterans, joined one such society, the Society Against Presumptuousness of \nJewry.— In any case, these odd characteristics of the two Nazi leaders would tend to fuel the theory of some that Hitler was \ndeliberately manipulated and placed into power, and secretly manipulated behind the scenes by more powerful forces than even he \npublicly wielded, and, when he had served his purpose, was deliberately sabotaged and cast aside. \n\n\nb. Bormann ’s Surrender of the A-Bomb to the USA: The Hydrick Thesis \n\n\nIn any case, it is Bormann’s role in establishing the secret strategic evacuation plans for Nazism after its military collapse that \ninterests us here. It was evident to Bormann, as to other high-ranking Nazis, that after the disaster of Stalingrad in early 1943, it was \nonly a matter of time before the military collapse of the Reich if its secret weapons projects did not bear fruit in time. Bormann and \nother top Nazis, representatives from the agencies of armaments of the Reich, from industry, and of course, from the SS gathered in \nsecret meetings to establish the pipelines for the transference out of Germany of enormous amounts of liquid assets, personnel skilled \nin scientific research or covert intelligence operations, and of blueprints of weapons and other technologies. \n\nAs regards scientific matters, there is an interesting fact presented in Linda Hunt’s book The United States Government, Nazi \nScientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945 to 1990. In that book, Hunt gives the following account of how the United States was so \nquickly able to find and acquire the German scientists and technologies it sought in connection with Project Paperclip: \n\nOne of JIOA Director Gruhn’s first actions as overall administrator of the project was to compile a hiring list of the best- \nqualified German and Austrian scientists that was used by both the United States and Great Britain as a recruitment tool for \ndecades. Although this list has been mentioned in the past by journalists and historians, no one ever noted that it was partially \ncompiled by Wemer Osenberg, the notorious wartime commander of the Gestapo’s scientific section. The decision to use \nOsenberg was made by U.S. Navy Captain Ransom Davis after consultation with the (Joint Chiefs of Staff). \n\nDuring the war, Osenberg was in charge of a special SS research council directly subordinate to Reichsmarschal Herman \nGoring. Osenberg sent his Gestapo agents to investigate work in progress at scientific institutes and report back on each \nscientist’s political reliability. From those reports and the Gestapo’s files, Osenberg compiled a list of fifteen thousand names \nof scientists in the Third Reich. He wrote comments next to the scientists’ names regarding their political affiliations, such as SS \nmembership, and his opinion of their Scientific abilities. Of course, those scientists who held fanatic Nazi views and SS \nmembership were also those whom Osenberg considered best qualified. \n\nOsenberg had been captured in 1945 by the Alsos team and interned in a camp in Germany. Soon after the JIOA expressed \nan interest in him, intelligence officers whisked him out of Germany to Versailles, France, where he set up business as usual, \nsifting through his files to suggest names of those he considered the best scientists in the Third Reich — \n\nNote then, that with Osenberg one has confirmation of a number of themes that have been suggested earlier in this book, as well as \nin my previous book on this subject, Reich of the Black Sun. \n\n1. As a member of the Gestapo and SS, Osenberg’s files would, via “Gestapo Muller”, have surely been known to Bormann, \nthus giving Bormann extensive knowledge not only over what was being researched, but who was doing it. \n\n2. Thus, while Himmler may have, at one time, tried to keep Bormann out of the loop on the extent of Nazi secret weapons \nresearch being conducted by the SS, he would have known about it via other private channels available to him. \n\n3. Bormann was thus faultlessly well-informed not only of the state and extent of these projects — and therefore, not only knew \n\n\nof Germany’s atom bomb project and its actual state, but of the more exotic areas of research represented by the Bell — but \nalso of the political reliability of the scientists conducting the research. \n\n4. With such a list in hand, Bormann and his allies in the strategic evacuation operation would have known exactly who, and \nwhat, was to go where, and, via their knowledge of each individual person’s political views and loyalty, could have limited \nthe risks to any planned continued independent development of the projects already begun, as well as of any planned \ninfiltration of any host country’s military and intelligence angencies. With such a list in hand, they could have ensured at least \na partial continuance of these projects, provided a network of coordination could be established to do so. Establishment of \ncoordination would have taken advantage of each host country’s own “compartmentalization” of security and research, \nexercising a hidden center of direction. \n\n5. The “Network” in question most likely would have included, but was not limited to, General Gehlen’s organization or SS \nMajor Otto Skorzeny’s “Fascista Intemacionale.” \n\n6. Finally, the Osenberg list and evident American interest in it seems to corroborate another speculation, namely, that \nAmerican knowledge and the nature of its specificity, as reflected in General Patton’s unerring military drives to the nerve \ncenters of Kammler’s secret research departments, could only have come from inside Nazi Germany itself. Since Carter \nHydrick has argued a convincing case that it was Bormann himself who directed the surrender of Germany’s atom bomb \nsecrets to the United States, it may be reasonably asserted that it was Bormann ultimately coordinating the flow of other \nsensitive information concerning the Kammlerstab to American intelligence, since he, clearly, is in the position to be the best \ninformed about the nature, extent, and personnel involved with all of Germany’s black projects. \n\nWith this knowledge at his disposal, the thesis of Carter Hydric, that Bormann helped engineer not only the transference of the \nenriched uranium of the U-boat 234 to the United States, but also that he may have engineered the transference of a functioning \nbomb to the United States as well, gains credibility.— \n\nOne odd occurrence — one again not in harmony with the postwar Allied Fegend about German incompetence in nuclear bomb \nengineering — is the fact that German physicist Rudolf Fleischmann was flown to the USA for interrogation prior to the bombing of \nHiroshima and Nagasaki. — Why the urgent need to consult a German physicist prior to bombing Japan? After all, the Allied \nFegend would have it that we had almost nothing to learn from the Germans about atom bomb physics. \n\n\nc. Bormann’s “Special Evacuation Command ” and Kammler’s Bell: the Nick Cook Thesis \n\n\nIt is against the backdrop of Bormann’s probable survival of the war and his possible arrangement to transfer atomic bomb \nmaterials via the U-234 to the United States, if not of a functioning bomb itself, that his establishment of a special “SS Evacuation \nCommand” at the war’s end should be viewed. As was seen in my earlier book, Jane’s Defence Weekly author and journalist Nick \nCook, following the research of Igor Witkowski, notes that Bormann had established this command, placed it under the direct \njurisdiction of SS General Hans Kammler, and also placed a special Luftwaffe unit of ultra-long range Junkers transport aircraft also \nunder his exclusive command. After the establishment of this command, whose aircraft were, “coincidentally” based in Fower \nSilesia, Kammler, the Bell, all associated papers concerning the Bell, and the enormous Ju 390 that most probably carried it out of \nGermany, disappeared completely. Where did it, and the advanced physics and technologies that it carried, go? \n\nOne answer, is, of course, to America. \n\n\nd. Continuation of Ultra-Black Projects and German “Independence” at White Sands and NASA \n\n\nWhatever their engineering skills may have been, the German scientists at NASA also appeared to be very adept at political \nmaneuvering as well. We have already noted in chapter three how Wemer Von Braun himself managed quickly to befriend not only \nJ. Edgar Hoover, but the powerful Democratic Majority leader in the US Senate, Fyndon Baines Johnson, a man whose views on \nthe necessity for space travel, and space militarization, are well-known. \n\nGerman independence from their American hosts became apparent very early on, in the so-called “Juarez Incident,” where a \nmodified V-2 of extended range was test fired at White Sands. The project was called, oddly enough, Project Hermes, and was \nunder the direction of Paperclip scientist Ernst Steinhof. The rocket went astray, and landed in Juarez, Mexico. Steinhof, who could \nhave ordered the rocket destroyed in mid-flight when it went off course, did not do so. \n\nThe controversy over the Juarez incident overshadowed a more serious problem at White Sands and Fort Bliss Army base in \n\n\nTexas. What happened there is a flaring example of the military’s total lack of control over enemy aliens who were judged to be \na threat to the internal security of the United States. Even though there were allegations of sabotage and evidence of gross \nviolations of base security, as one intelligence agent bluntly put it, there was absolutely “no attempts to place them in anything \nlike custody.” Army officers in charge of the group maintained little or no surveillance over the Germans’ activities either on or \noff the base.— \n\nLater on, the German paperclip scientists at NASA under Debus, Von Braun, Arthur Rudolf and others in fact showed so much \nindependence that an entirely different concern began to manifest itself. \n\nJames Webb, NASA’s second administrator, complained that the Germans were circumventing the system by attempting to \nbuild the Saturn V in-house at the center. Rocco Petrone, who became the Marshall Director in 1973, said that Webb felt the \ngroup needed to be more tightly managed.— \n\nIn other words, the Paperclip Germans were attempting to circumvent the normal contract and bidding process of the American \ngovernment and, using NASA itself as the constructing agency, build the giant Saturn V Apollo boosters on their own. Perhaps they \nwere simply fed up with the bidding process and bureaucratic inertia. Or perhaps there was a more sinister agenda. \n\nBut the news from France was not good either. There, employed in projects that would eventually give France its own space \nbooster capability as well as its own land-based and submarine-based ballistic missiles, France’s version of the German Paperclip \nscientists were apparently up to the same sort of thing. Colonel Frank Reed was concerned about security leaks by the Paperclip \npersonnel, because \n\nHe had just returned from visiting Saint Louis, France, where a comparable group of German rocket engineers worked for the \nFrench government. While there, the French commandant told Reed he suspected the Germans under French control were \nreceiving orders from Germany and working toward a reemergence of the Third Reich,— \n\nIn other words, regardless of whether or not one accepts the speculation of continued independent Nazi development of their secret \nprojects, the behavior of the German scientists in at least two of the wartime Allied countries that became their subsequent hosts \nindicates some continued connection and coordination between them from some unknown quarter, and the only possible quarter that \ncould conceivably command their continued allegiance and loyalty in this respect is some version of the Gehlenorg, or of ODESSA, \nor some other similar international network of Nazism. \n\nNor is this merely idle speculation. Operation Paperclip researcher Tom Bower drew attention to the fact that American \nintelligence, very early on, was aware that some sort of command structure was still intact and functioning among the German rocket \nscientists: \n\nThree Peenemiinde scientists, all anti-Nazis who had refused American contracts, confided to Osborne that the rocket team’s \nstrict hierarchical structure under Domberger, Axster, and von Braun had remained intact despite the German surrender. Before \nevery interrogation, each German was carefully briefed by the triumvirate and their lieutenants about what could and could not \nbe disclosed. The guidelines were explicit: divulge no more than required to arouse technical and scientific curiosity and avoid \ngoing into technical detail that would render employment by the Americans unnecessary....After every interrogation, each \nGerman was debriefed in the presence of his colleagues, so that the others knew precisely what was the Americans’ current \nstate of knowledge. Osborne also discovered that those scientists who criticized or failed to obey Doenberger’s edicts were \npunished.— \n\n\nE. Skull and Bones and “Secret Germany ” \n\n\n\n1. 2004: Bonesman Bush “ versus” Bonesman Kerry \n\n\nBut the German and Nazi connection behind the JFK murder, and behind the alleged MAJIC-12 group, is not merely an historical \nmatter of a relatively distant past. It is every bit a contemporary and lasting legacy of power, influence, and corruption. \n\nAs briefly as it came to the public’s attention, and then was “buried” behind a facade of ostensibly more important “issues,” the \n2004 American presidential election hosted somewhat of a first, for the candidates from both major political parties had something \nhighly unusual in common, both incumbent Republican President George Walker “Dubya” Bush and Massachusetts Democratic \nSenator John Kerry were both initiated during their senior year as students at Yale University, into the same secret society, the Skull \nand Bones society. \n\nFrom one point of view, then, the 2004 election was indeed, “fixed,” since no matter what the outcome, a Bonesman would be in \nthe White House. But surely it does not matter if both Bush and Kerry were members of the same innocent, prank-filled college \nfraternity. \n\nIt would not, if Skull and Bones were merely a “college fraternity.” The trouble is, it is not, nor are its members and alumni \nordinary “common” people. \n\n\n\n2. Daddy and Dubya Bush: The RNC and the Eastern European Emigre Community \n\n\nConsider, for example, that President Bush’s father, former President George Herbert Walker Bush, was also a member, as was \nhis father, former Senator Prescott Bush, as was former President and Supreme Court Justice William Howard Taft....and on an on \nthe list would go, including prominent clergymen, businessmen, lawyers, and government officials. \n\nWhile this is not the place to go into an exhaustive history of Skull and Bones, for our purposes it is important to note that the \nSociety itself, founded at Yale in 1832, has German roots, being the first, and presumably not the only, chapter of some very secret \nsociety that existed in Germany at the time, a society that, as of yet, no one seems to know the name of.— But given Skull and \nBones’ members’ heavy involvement in religion, law, finance, and politics, one can guess at one German secret society with similar \ninterests, initiatory methods, and goals: Adam Weishaupt’s Bavarian Illuminati. We have already pointed out that Bonnann made his \nlegal residence near Ingolstadt. \n\nIt must be recalled that a great deal of the Bush family fortune was made by Prescott Bush precisely in utilizing his “German \nconnections” to do business with Nazi Germany. Indeed, the business interests of Prescott Bush with Germany were considered so \nextensive that his concerns fell under the “Trading with the Enemy Act”.— \n\nSon George H.W. Bush went on, of course, to become a Texas oilman, founding Zapata Oil company, and later became director \nof the CIA, and Ronald Reagan’s Vice President. And, during both Reagan’s first run for the Presidency as the Republican \ncandidate in 1990, and again, during George H.W. Bush’s run in 1988, the Republican national committee had some unusual and \npowerful political allies: the Eastern European emigre groups, whose leaders maintained publicly impeccable facades that cloaked \ntheir fascist and Nazi pasts.— \n\n\n3. Secret Germany \n\n\nThat there are long, and secret, associations and contacts between the United States and Germany is evident from the Skull and \nBones society, both as an organization founded as a chapter of some similar lodge in Germany, as well as through the individual and \nfamily connections represented by the Bushes and others who are members of that society. The connections, and associations, have \nplayed significant roles in American politics as well, as is evident in the fallout from Operation Paperclip, the Kennedy assassination, \nand even its much more limited role in the election of Presidents Reagan and G.H.W. Bush. \n\nBut there may be a far older association, a far older historical pedigree, one dating back to the Hohenstaufen Emperors of \nGermany, and to their global imperialistic ambitions. \n\nIn 1943, while World War Two was raging in its full fury, an American author published a little-known and long-forgotten book \ncalled The Thousand Year Conspiracy: Secret Germany Behind the Mask.— The author’s name was Paul Winkler, and he sought \nto explain the most fundamental mystery of World War Two — and indeed, in a certain sense, of World War One as well — and \nthat was, what on earth had happened to the Germans? \n\nThe Germans, Winkler was careful to point out, were no more or less warlike than any other people. Germany had exercised a \nprofound cultural influence on the formation of the “Western ethos”: engineers and musicians and physicists and biologists all \nstudied German before the war, and clamored to enter her universities. Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Schumann, Schubert, Brahms, \nDiirer, Luther, Einstein, Planck, and on and on the list could go, of famous Germans who profoundly enriched human experience. \n\nYet, that was the mystery, for while being no more or less warlike as a people than anyone else, when they did go to war, they \ndid it.... they did it well. And with Nazism, it seemed to many as if something in the genius of the German people had gone quite \ninsane, that some “ethnic character defect” had become so pathological that many called for the actual sterilization and extermination \nof Germans after the war. Indeed, serious plans were drawn up in the United States — the so-called “Morgenthau Plan” — that \nwould have left Germany stripped of all industry and reduced to a servile agrarian state depopulated by some tens of millions, the \nultimate Jewish revenge, perhaps, for Nazism’s crimes. \n\nBut for Winkler, Nazism, and Germany’s well-known ability to wage war, was “not the product of some ‘spontaneous \ngeneration’ crystallized by Hitler’s evil genius” nor was it “simply a reaction to the harsh terms of the Versailles treaty” nor did it \nderive “from some basic trait in the German character.”— For Winkler, Nazism was the manifestation of something far older, and \nfar more sinister. It was the manifestation of a millenium’s long secret conspiracy. It was, in short, a “secret society gone public.” \n\nIn 1921....during one of the sessions of the Bavarian ‘Landtag’ (Pariliament), the Deputy Gareis, with a heavy pile of \ndocuments in his hands, made a statement to the other Deputies which none of them seemed able to understand: ‘I have here the \nevidence of a thousand years’ conspiracy - evidence which I shall present to you shortly.’ \n\nA few days later Gareis was murdered. The criminal escaped punishment and the incident was practically forgotten. The \nevidence to which Gareis referred was never revealed.— \n\nBut this incident was enough to fuel Winkler’s own quest to reconstruct what Deputy Gareis had unearthed. \n\nWhat Gareis had unearthed, was not a defect in Germany, but rather, a defect that dominated Germany: Prussia and \n“Prussianism.” Winkler comments as follows: \n\nFor us, ‘Prussianism’ goes back to the early part of the thirteenth century and is still very much alive in our day. It is the heir of \nthe world-embracing ambitions of the Carolingians and ‘Holy Roman ’ Emperors — but at the same time it is also what it \nbecame during the centuries in the stuffy and nauseating hot-house of East Prussia. \n\nThe principal events in Germany between the two World Wars, the reasons for Hitler’s rise to power and the events that \nfollowed can be understood only by a thorough scrutiny of the Prusso-teutonic and Fehmic organizations.— \n\nThe “Fehmic organizations” that Winkler refers to are the Helige Vehme, which were secret imperial courts established by the \nGerman Holy Roman Emperors and their supporters in the various principalities and duchies, primarily Westphalia, that were to \nhand out and deliver death sentences to anyone convicted of treason against the empire. They were, in a sense, also secret societies, \nsince membership was by invitation-initiation. \n\nBut in any case, Winkler points the finger at something very significant, and usually completely ignored by histories of Nazism, \neven by those predisposed to view Nazism as a primarily occult or esoteric phenomenon. That something is the deep secret society \nconnection of Nazism to the old Teutonic Knights, themselves founded by the mediaeval German Emperors to further their \nimperialistic ambitions. \n\nAt a time when the Papacy and the German Emperors were locked in mortal combat and when the Papacy could call on its own \n\n\n“shock troops” in the form of the “military orders” like the Templars or Knights Hospitaliter of St. John, the German Emperors \nsought to create their own imperial version. The process began when “Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Hohenstaufen family \nhad himself proclaimed ‘master of the world,’ Dominus Mundi, in 1158 in the fields of Roncaglia during his second campaign in \nItaly.”— In order to offset the papal advantage with its military orders, the German Emperors created their own version, supporting \n“the formation of the purely German-armed Order of the Teutonic Knights.”— This was achieved through a long-term deception, \nfor initially the Order was founded with but vague ties to the Empire in order to secure the necessary papal blessing “indispensable to \nits prestige.”— Nonetheless, the Emperors managed to see that the head of the order during these years were always personally loyal \nto themselves. Finally, when the existence of the Order was “quite secure” it “more openly put itself at the service of the Imperial \nplans for expansion.”— The man responsible for putting the Teutonic Knights on this political footing was Hermann von Salza, the \nGrand Master from 1210 to 1239.— \n\nVon Salza approached the Polish Duke Conrad of Masovia and persuaded him that the Teutonic Knights would be able to assist \nhim in his battles against “heathen tribes,” namely, the Slavic Berussians, or Prussians, that inhabited the region later to become \nPrussia. Winkler continues the story: \n\nEarly in 1226 a formal invitation from Conrad arrived at the Order. Von Salza consulted with (Emperor) Frederick II at once \nand the latter, in his Bull of Rimini, entrusted von Salza with an imperial ‘mission’ for his future campaign. \n\nThis Bull.... Was the very basis for all future action of the Teutonic Knights; a permanent charter for all Prussian conquest, \nand all German political expansion which, during the centuries to come and until this day, was to radiate from that territory.— \n\nIn other words, if one follows the logic closely, an organization had a legal charter — a charter never revoked by competent \nauthority that could claim descent from the original granting authority — for conquest. And that organization was, by definition, a \nmilitary secret society whose core ideology was the establishment of a world empire with German, with Prussian, hegemony at its \nheart and height. \n\nThe Bull of Rimini may be taken then as the de facto founding of the Order that would play such a role in European geopolitics \nfor centuries to come. But equally important is the figure of the “renaissance man” Emperor Frederick II, well-known for his \nindulgence of scholars and sciences deemed esoteric by any standards, and certainly by the standards of the mediaeval Latin Church. \nFrederick liked to model his behavior on his famous grandfather Frederick Barbarossa,— and also maintained “that the Teutonic \nKnights had been founded by Barbarossa, a claim which seems to have no justification in fact.”— While Frederick II might have \nbeen trying to vest his Teutonic Knights with the aura of Barbarossa, and have invented this fact, it nonetheless cannot be discounted \nthat he might have also let slip the real founder of the Order. \n\nIn any case, it is the Order of the Teutonic Knights that must be considered the real heir to the global imperial ambitions of the \nmediaeval German Emperors, much more so than the German Empire itself.— \n\n\na. The Hohenzollerns Become Grand Masters of the Order \n\n\nBut by the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, northern German cities formed the trading league known as the Hansa, or \nHanseatic League, in part to overthrow the rule of the Order in cities along Germany’s eastern Baltic coast. This was successful. \nWith its fortune and military power declining, the Order was approached by a new ally — indeed its only ally in this period — the \nMargrave of Brandenburg, Frederick von Hohenzollem.— The two - the Order and the Hohenzollem Margravate — entered into a \npact to give assistance to each other against the subjects of each. And thus was bom the unusual alliance between the house of \nHohenzollem and the old Prussian noble interests represented by the Order. As a result of this relationship, by 1511 Albert von \nHohenzollem und Brandenburg was elected to the Grand Mastership of the order, a “post he filled with full understanding of the \nOrder’s traditions and ambitions.”— As Grand Master, Albert von Hohenzollem secularized the order in 1525 by transforming it \ninto the hereditary Duchy of Prussia.— The “secret society” component of the Order lived on in name, and also spawned several \noffshoot secret societies among the Junker nobility class in Prussia, one of which, the “Society of Lizards”, maintained the Order’s \noriginal imperial designs as well as esoteric doctrines.— \n\nBut then Winkler asks the all-important question: \n\nOne may ask whether there is an actual secret organization behind the Junkers and Prusso-Teutonics or whether the familiar \nPrusso-Teutonic organizations are responsible for the sequence of events presented in this book. \n\nReally secret organizations seldom betray their existence by outward signs. Nevertheless the founding of the secret ‘Society \n\n\nof Lizards’ (Eidechsengesellschaft) is an historical fact. Reliable historians have related how this society tried to pull the strings \nin Prussia while the Order of the Teutonic Knights still existed. Kotzebue attributes to the activities of this secret society the \nsecularization of Prussia. \n\nThe unilinear evolution which has taken place since then - in Prussia and in a Germany dominated by Prussia and which \ncorresponds point by point to the basic principles of the Society of Lizards might be considered sufficient circumstantial \nevidence of the survival of a secret Prusso-Teutonic organization right down to our time. But there is more. The entire process \nof Prussian growth seems to be inspired by an uninterrupted organic plan.... No interruption in the logic of events is observable, \nhowever, even since the time when the order ceased to manage the affairs of Prussia.... \n\nOur circumstantial evidence goes further: Germany was defeated in 1918 and the old ambitious plans of the Prussian \nelements seemed shattered forever; yet within a few months somebody, somewhere, behind the curtains in Germany, made \ndecisions of the highest importance. These decisions meant revival of the old Fehme, the organization of systematic terror \nplanned to undermine the young German Republic and to facilitate Gennany’s secret rearmament. So-called ‘secret societies’ \nsprang up from one day to the other all over Germany — societies which were secretive as regards the details of their decisions \nand activities, but whose existence itself was a secret from nobody. All these secret societies were closely connected among \nthemselves; and there was no rivalry between them. Their activities complemented each other wonderfully. Even a superficial \nobserver must conclude that all this was possible only if these societies received instructions from the same hidden, absolutely \nsecret sources.— \n\nAnd remember, Martin Bormann became a member of one of these secret societies, as did his then boss in the Nazi Party Rudolf \nHess. \n\n\nb. Hitler’s Only Known Initiation \n\n\nHere the story takes on another bizarre turn, a turn that is the only known verification of what many have long suspected: that \nHitler was a secret society initiate, at some time and some place. But Winkler’s version of the story points not to the usual suspects - \nthe Thulegesellschaft and its shady associations with Viennese esotericists and racists Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels — \nbut to the old Teutonic Knights: \n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Emperor Wilhelm II, who was nurtured on the traditions of the Prusso-Teutonic Order, \nactually reestablished this Order in Prussia and Germany. The descendants of those who, acting in the Society of Lizards, \ndisplaced the ancient Order from Prussia — and contributed thus to its disintegration — now claimed for themselves the right \nto appear cloaked in the dignity of those whose place they had taken.... Not much was said about the activities of the revived \nOrder, but its yearly conventions in East Prussia were generally noted by the German newspapers. A few months after the \nbeginning of the present war, a short notice appeared in German papers announcing that Hitler himself had been initiated into \nthe Teutonic Order. \n\nNo information is published about the internal organization of the contemporary Prusso-Teutonic Order, nor about its exact \nconnections with what - if it still exists - is the present-day survival of the Society of Lizards. \n\n....In this connection it is interesting to note that in May, 1924, when the 700 th anniversary of the University of Naples, a \nUniversity founded by Emperor Frederick II, was celebrated, a crown was found near the sarcophage of the Emperor in the \nCathedral of Palermo with the following inscription: \n\n“Seinem Kaiser und Helden \n\nDas geheime Deutschland” \n\n(“To Their Emperor and Hero, From Secret Germany”) \n\nIf we assume the existence of a Secret Germany, the open Junker organizations like the Reichs-Landbund and the Herrenklub \n— which also derive from the Order of the thirteenth century — have only a secondary role, carrying out instructions of the \nsecret group like all the other recently established societies which we have mentioned. But even if we disregard the \ncircumstantial evidence which proves the actual survival of Secret Germany, we must admit that a straight line can be detected \nbetween the Teutonic Order of the thirteenth century and the Germany of today.— \n\nIn other words, Kaiser Wilhelm II could well afford to abdicate the imperial throne in 1918 at the end of World War One, and go \ninto exile in Holland, for, as Grand Master of whatever secret society entity still existed in Prussia, he and the Hohenzollems and the \n\n\nPrussian imperialist interests they represented still exercised power and influence behind the scenes. And in any case, the purpose of \nthe initiation of Hitler into this order is clear enough: the bargain had been made with the public political party that would best carry \nthrough its secret ambitions. \n\nAnd what of Bormann? All of this would have been known to him as well. \n\nAnd it should come as no surprise that this ideology of world domination by an elite also forms the motivation of another secret \nsociety, one with its own Germanic connections: Skull and Bones. \n\n\n\nF. Final Thoughts \n\n\nSo, if the Nazis, a “Brotherhood of the Bell,” were involved with the assassination of President Kennedy — and a circumstantial \ncase has been presented that they were, and at a very high level — then what motivated their involvement? \n\nThe previous chapters have outlined a case that this motivation consisted of several factors, each one alone a sufficient reason for \ntheir involvement, and that, taken together, tend to increase the probability that they were involved at the deepest and highest levels \nof the conspiracy: \n\n1. They were involved to protect the technology that they had developed during the war, and its continued quasi-independent \nor independent development. This was threatened by Kennedy in any number of ways, by his attempt to smash the CIA, \nwhich provided a useful cover for some of their political activities, to his attempt to establish limited cooperation with the \nSoviets in space. If there was an alternative technology of propulsion involved in the Apollo program, and specifically with \nthe LEM (Lunar Excursion Module), such cooperation might have revealed to the Soviets, bitter enemies of the Nazis, a \ncomponent of their technology as well as their program of its continued secret development. \n\n2. They were involved to protect their bases of financial and political operation, not only within and behind the various Federal \nagencies and American corporations which they had infiltrated, but also within and behind the various other host countries \n— particularly in Latin America — that any degree of exposure, such as “smashing the CIA” might have caused, would \nhave threatened. \n\n3. If one posits a connection between an ongoing “Nazi International” and international organized crime, as is likely since drug \nrunning, gambling, and so on would be easy means for funding and laundering money for black projects, then the actions of \nthe Kennedy administration against organized crime would also constitute a threat to these interests. \n\n4. If the actions of the Bunge Corporation in massive short-selling on the day of the assassination are an indicator of a deeper \nNazi involvement — and it must not be forgotten that Bunge was at that time a German company with headquarters in \nArgentina — then a subsidiary motivation offers itself, though one that did not enter into the primary calculations for the \nmurder: financial gain. Having entered into(or initiated) a conspiracy to assassinate the President, it would have been \nuncharacteristic for a Nazi International, especially one headed by the financial wizard Bormann, not to have planned to \nprofit from it. \n\n5. Finally, though not discussed, such a public murder would have an inevitable demoralizing effect on the American psyche, it \nwould serve as a reminder that the hidden elite can remove anyone, at any time, any where, and get away with it. It was a \nwarning, even to the rich and powerful like the Kennedy family, not to attempt to dismantle the loci of power they had put \ninto place to ensure their own continued accretion of power, wealth, and influence. \n\nWhether the Nazis initiated this conspiracy, or later wormed their way into it, is in the final analysis immaterial. But it is clear that \nthey were involved, and at some very deep level. \n\nAnd of all the groups with connections to the assassination conspiracy — Mafia, disgruntled anti-Castro Cubans, big business, big \noil, threatened Federal Reserve shareholders, the military-industrial-intelligence complex, the space program, each group with its \nown motivation for killing the President - one thing stands out most clearly, when one considers all the evidence. The Nazis were the \none group that shared motivations with all the others. They were the one group with connections to all of them. \n\n\n\n10 . \n\n\n„What is the Brotherhood of the Bell?“ \n\nThe Brotherhood of the Bell in History and Practice \n\n\n“And yes, in addition to these many ‘petty ’ little conspiracies, there really is a great conspiracy — in fact, there are many oj \nthem. Churchill just referred to the entire set of conspiring cartels as the ‘High Caba/. ’ This is a /oose-knit set oj \nextraordinarily wealthy cartels that between them control much of the financial power of the world. \n\nSo what was the SS Brotherhood of the Bell? \n\nFrom one perspective, that represented by the epigraph above, it was the latest in a long line of organizations designed to suppress \nalternative energy sources in a history of suppression that began in the nineteenth century, and really took firm root with J.P. \nMorgan’s suppression of Nikola Tesla early in the twentieth century. \n\nBut that is a simplistic picture. \n\nThe SS Brotherhood of the Bell was the entire organization of secret research — and the security to protect it - that was developed \nby the Third Reich in conjunction with its secret weapons projects. That this group intended its existence and research to continue \nafter the war is evidenced by the measures it took to protect the secrets of the Bell by murdering most of its research team, and by \nspiriting the Bell itself and its project documentation out of Europe to.to wherever it went. \n\nFrom the historical perspective, the “SS Brotherhood of the Bell” is both reality and a symbol. As a symbol, it is a sign of what \nhappens when a network of cartels and greedy power-hungry businessmen decide that they know what is best for everyone else, and \nput into power a political party whose ideology is in consonance with their own grotesque designs for a “New World Order,” who \nplan the rise, rule of terror, and dizzy fall of a world military super-power all within the lightening fast period of twelve years. In that \nsense, too, the Third Reich was perhaps a dress rehearsal. \n\nBut as a reality, the SS Brotherhood of the Bell was the first historically documented case of a secret development of an off-the- \nbooks physics and technology that promises limitless good, and possesses the boundless potential for evil. It is likewise the first \ndocumented case of the genuine existence of an alternative and very secret technology. Similarly, it is the first historical example of \nthe measures taken not only to secretly develop it, but also to suppress any thoughts or inclinations toward an open development of \nits full potential. The “SS Brotherhood,” like its Teutonic Knights forebears, did not hesitate to murder in order to protect the \ninstruments of its hegemony. \n\nIn yet another sense, the SS Brotherhood of the Bell is also the first historical example of a “Military Assessment Joint Intelligence \nCommittee;” or, to put it more succinctly and familiarly, the Brotherhood of the Bell is the first real example of a kind of MAJIC-12 \ngroup, a group tasked with the secret development of technology and with security and disinformation campaigns designed to deflect \nattention of anyone who might get too close, and when that fails, to eliminate the interloper. Whether or not this Brotherhood \ninfiltrated the later MAJIC-12 group or indeed became its nucleus, there is little doubt that a connection exists, and my intuition tells \nme it may have been a component in its initial formation. \n\nIn chapters five and six, argumentation was presented that the Bell represented perhaps the first known “scalar” device, a device \nmost probably intended by the Germans to be a breakthrough in propulsion. It certainly was that, and in this instance, the \nBrotherhood of the Bell may likewise be seen to be the first historical example of a genuinely secret space program. In this regard, \nrecall the significance of the fact that Dr. Kurt Debus, a member of the Peenemiinde rocket team — Nazi Germany’s “open” space \nprogram — was also a member of the Bell’s research team, a very hidden and secret project. \n\nIn any case, as a proto-scalar device, its weaponization potential, if not initially planned on or realized by the Germans, was \nquickly perceived by them. Of that there can be no doubt, since its classification as Kriegsentscheidend clearly indicates their \nperception of its potential as a weapon or weapons platform. Its significance as a proto-scalar device would thus seem to render Tom \nBearden’s following extensive remarks about the suppression of alternative physics and technology — and who is behind it - more \nsignificant. Bearden’s remarks, cited extensively below, should be read not only for their intrinsic worth, but in the context of what \nhas preceded in this book, for they are characteristic of the operation of any “Brotherhood of the Bell”. \n\nAnd yes, in addition to these many “petty” little conspiracies, there really is a great conspiracy - in fact, there are many of them. \nChurchill just referred to the entire set of conspiring cartels as the “High Cabal.” This is a loose-knit set of extraordinarily \nwealthy cartels that between them control much of the financial power of the world. You can only find the principals behind a \n\n\n\ncouple of hundred of interlocking corporations, if you penetrate deeply enough. Much of their great financial income comes \nfrom the control of energy at its various levels, through a net of interlocking corporations. Something like $2 trillion dollars per \nyear is their “take” from energy worldwide. Oil plays a great role in that. These “high cabal” fellows make or break nations \nfinancially, as is almost being done to Argentina as this is being written. They also have been stopping (Coefficient of \nPerformance greater than unity) electrical power systems since shortly after the turn of the century, using whatever means are \nnecessary - fair or foul. That is why we are still burning oil, coal, and natural gas, and why our automobiles and trucks run off \ngasoline and diesel, and not off free electrical energy from the vacuum. The high cabal intends to keep it that way. Some of the \nmajor primary means of “stopping” invention have been as follows: \n\na. Manipulation and improper use of the law (Gray’s production line was shut down by law officers before his engines \ncould roll off there and onto the market). \n\nb. Involving the unsuspecting inventor in drug charges by planting drugs on his property surreptitiously, then secretly \nnotifying the drug enforcement officials who suddenly raid the premises and discover the narcotics, resulting in the \ninventor going to jail since he had been caught “red-handed.” \n\nc. Threatening the inventor’s life and the lives of his family, to frighten him away from what he is doing. \n\nd. Arranging a fatal accident for the inventor, such as a fatal auto accident, a fall from a high place, or drowning. \n\ne. Assassination. Hit men are fairly simple to hire; a good one is a bit more difficult to hire but it’s doable. A good hit man \n\nmight assume a disguise and fake a robbery, shooting and killing the target in the “robbery.” In an extreme case, he just \nfires at a distance with a professional sniper rifle that is silenced.— A variation is the use of a “throwaway” assassin, a \nfellow who has been deeply conditioned by very harsh methods, to deeply involve his autonomic nervous system. He \ncan be spotted by the “glaring eyes” effect of autonomic nervous system involvement. This fellow is only marginally \nfunctional in real life, and requires a handler. He also must “fixate” for some minutes (usually from 20 to 30) on the \ntarget, by staring at him for a period. Then - say, the next day - while the target is at lunch in a public restaurant, the \nthrowaway walks in, walks straight to the target, and empties a pistol in him at point blank range. He remains there until \nthe police arrive and arrest him. He is immune even to torture; nothing can be gotten out of him, even by electrical \nshocks on his genitals. \n\nf. Making the inventor an offer he “cannot refuse,” in the old Mafia sense. In the latter, nicely dressed persons come to the \ninventor’s house, meet with him, and offer him a large sum of money to quit what he is doing for the rest of his life. The \ngoing sum varies between $5 million and $10 million, usually. The offer is real and it cannot be refused, either the \ninventor accepts it. or he and all his family are dead when these gentlemen leave the premises. If the inventor refuses \nanyway, he and his family are killed. Usually the bodies also just “disappear” and are never found or heard from again. \n\ng. These days, variations are used such as a careful crask of another auto into the back of the inventor’s car so he is really \nshaken up badly but not seriously hurt. He goes to the hospital for checkup, in case of concussion, etc. Everything is \nseemingly okay, but he is kept overnight for observation. That night he is given a hypodermic of air in his veins. Next \nmorning his family receives a call that the inventor has suffered seizures from an apparent concussion after all, and is \nfighting for his life. If he doesn’t die, he becomes a human vegetable. Piece of cake. \n\nh. Then there’s the ice dart dipped in curare. The curare paralyzes the muscles of the heart and lungs; the inventor goes \ndown in convulsive floundering, gasping and unable to breathe or pump blood. He expires very quickly. The curare \nbreaks down in the body, the ice melts, and you have a fellow the medics find died of convulsive hheart seizure,. Etc. \nWorks like a charm. This is an adapted “dirty spooks” trick, adapted from those branches of the intelligence \ncommunities of the world that specialize in assassinations. \n\ni. Use of “gaming,” which was originally developed to influence or change the behavior of foreign leaders. Imagine \nwriting a scenario, as for a movie. Only you have the deep psychological profile of the targeted individual. You also \nhave the deep psychological profiles of quite a few other individuals who have “knee-jerk” reactions in a certain \ndirection useful to you in your games (in your scenarios). These are called “agents of influence”, to get them into \ninteracting with the target, only a phone call or other contact need be made and a stimulus given, and they are off and \nrunning, self-powered and going after that target with their knee-jerk response. So very sophisticated computers are \nused, the scenario (intended plot of events to happen) is prepared (the artificial intelligence programs will even give the \nprobabilities of success of all the variants), and a recommended scenario variant is derived and accepted. Then the \ncontroller has one or more agents working for him that contact the players (the agents of influence). They get their \nphone calls or stimuli, react in predictable fashion, and come pell-mell at the inventor, interacting all over the board with \nhim. The range of games is enormous, from stock schemes to lawsuits to infiltrating agents of influence into the internal \norganization of the inventor to money laundering, etc. The controller follows the progress, and only once in awhile \nmakes slight adjustments (may need to trigger other agents of influence, send in one actual agent, etc.). Over the last 20 \n\n\n\nyears, the gaming has become very expert. So many games can be launched against a single inventor that he usually is \nfinished or nullified by one of them, eventually. Having been gamed over 200 times in the last two decades, I plan to \nwrite a book one day on the subject of the games and what to watch for. \n\nj. ... \n\nk. A variation is to send in a special agent who penetrates the (inventor’s) group and becomes a member. Indeed, the high \ncabal has certain persons who specialize in just such penetration and are specialists at setting up disruption. They have \nhad plenty of practice, and are very good ar their trade. The identities of some of these “special agents” would surprise \nthe causal observer. The so-called “overunity community” is rather strongly penetrated and misdirected by a number of \nsuch special agents, in addition to a greater number of agents of influence.— \n\n\nSuch a passage, coming in the middle of an otherwise highly theoretical physics text, is extraordinary. \n\n\nA. Nick Redfern ’s FBI Documents on Nazis and UFOs \n\n\nUFOlogist Nick Redfern is one of few “mainstream UFOlogists” that has at least given the Nazi angle on the early UFO \nphenomenon a hearing. In fact, he has done more than just give it a hearing, but devoted a whole chapter to it in his book The F.B.I. \nFiles: The FBFs UFO Top Secrets Exposed. \n\nBefore addressing the issue of FBI involvement in this matter, let us first acquaint ourselves with those few tantalizing facts on \nthis emotive issue. Consider the following, extracted from a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report of 27 May 1954: \n\n“A German newspaper (not further identified) recently published an interview with George Klein, famous German engineer \nand aircraft expert, describing the experimental construction of ‘flying saucers’ carried out by him from 1941 to 1945. Klein \nstated that he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted ‘flying saucer’ took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour \nwithin 3 minutes. The experiments resulted in three designs: one designed by Meithe, was a disk-shaped aircraft, 135 feet in \ndiameter, which did not rotate; another, designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating ring, in the center \nof which was a round, stationary cabin gor the crew. When the Soviets occupied Prague, the Germans destroyed every trace of \nthe ‘flying saucer’ project and nothing more was heard of Habennohl and his assistants. Schriever recently died in Bremen, \nwhere he had been living. In Breslau, the Soviets managed to capture one of the saucers built by Miethe, who escaped to \nFrance. He is reportedly in the US at present.— \n\nThis is the standard Nazi Legend of the UFO: the secret test facilities in Breslau and Prague, the names of Habermohl, Schriever, \nand Miethe, and the allegation of Soviet capture of at least one of these devices. Again, with Prague, one has the connection to the \nKammlerstab. \n\nBut with the mention of Breslau, one must pause once again to consider yet another curious “operational anomaly” of the end of \nWorld War Two, and that anomaly is the fanatical German defense of Breslau against the overwhelming Soviet forces besieging the \ncity. Breslau, of course, was in Lower Silesia, then a province of Germany. As such, it was the nearest large city to the environs \nwhere the Bell was tested. So, once again, behind the consistent Nazi UFO Legend and its insistence that something highly \nadvanced was being worked on in or near Breslau, one has in The Bell the probable basis of the legend. It should be noted, \nhowever, that at no time in the development of the history of the Bell does Polish researcher Igor Witkowski ever mention the names \nof Miethe, Habermohl, or Schriever in connection with it. \n\nRedfern also mentions the involvement of the United States Air Force in tracking down the Nazi Legend of the UFO: \n\nA report dated 3 January 1952 from Brigadier General W.M. Garland, USAF, to General Samford, Air Force Director of \nIntelligence,—, also addresses the issue of German involvement in the UFO mystery. Although somewhat speculative, relevant \nportions of the report confirm that elements of the USAF were of the opinion that some UFOs were of earthly origin. \n\n“The continued reports of unusual flying objects requires positive action to determine the nature and origin of this \nphenomena (sic).... It is logical to relate the reported sightings to the known development of aircraft, jet propulsion, rockets and \nrange extension capabilities in Germany and the USSR. In this connection, it is to be noted that certain developments by the \nGermans, particularly the Horton wing, jet propulsion, and refueling, combined with their extensive employment of V-l and V- \n2 weapons during World War II, lend credence to the possibility that the flying objects may be of German and Russian origin. \nThe developments mentioned above were completed and operational between 1941 and 1944 and subsequently fell into the \nhands of the Soviets at the end of the war. There is evidence that the Germans were working on these projects as far back as \n1931 to 1938. Therefore it may be assumed that the Germans had at least a 7 to 10 year lead over the United States....— \n\nReading carefully between the lines, it is clear that as late as 1952, the director of United States Air Force Intelligence is entertaining \nthe possibility not only that some UFOs are of Soviet origin, but of German origin as well. But in 1952, Germany was already \ndivided, and in no economic shape to continue such black projects. In other words, General Garland was indicating a possibly \nindependent and continued German development of these technologies in places outside of Germany. Note too that according to \nGeneral Garland, such projects may have been begun in the early 1930s, with the terminus ante quern being fully two years before \nthe Nazis took power. In any case, the period from 1931 to 1938 was when the various “aether vortex theories” were being \ndeveloped in Germany by Hilgenberg and others, so it stands to reason that some experimental headway in technologies based upon \nthose theories had already been made. \n\nHowever, Garland’s remarks might indicate much more, if one places them in the wider context of the Bell, the Kammlerstab, and \nIgor Witkowski’s own remarks to the effect that the Bell represented an “off-the-books” program, buried deep behind the V- 1 and \n\n\nV-2 and various other rocket and secret weapons projects of Nazi Germany. In effect, Garland is indicating that the possible real \nbeginnings of a UFO-study and engineering group were in the years prior to World War Two, and in Germany. In this connection, I \npointed out in my previous book on Nazi secret weapons, Reich of the Black Sun, that such a secret UFO study group clearly existed \nin Fascist Italy, having been established by Benito Mussolini in 1933.— By the time of the end of the war, the SS had in effect \nbecome this “study group,” and it is no less significant that The Bell was its most sensitive project. \n\nRedfem then cites an FBI report that indicates that those on the “inside” were clearly aware that something was quite wrong with \nthe Allied Legend of American nuclear bomb-engineering superiority over the Germans: \n\n...In addition (source) said that more recent reports have been received from representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency \nin Southern Europe and Southern Asia to the effect that the Russians were experimenting with some type of radical aircraft or \nguided missile which could be dispatched for great distances out over the sea, made to turn in flight and return to the base from \nwhich it was launched. He related that this information was extremely worthy of notice as experiments in this country have so \nfar only developed to the point where we are concerned with delivering a missile to the required point of impact and no \nconsideration has been given to imparting to that missile the ability to return. (Source) also advised that it is a known fact that \nthe Russians are attempting to develop some type of nuclear energy, that they received a wealth of information concerning \nnuclear energy at the time of their occupation in Germany, and that they have at their disposal a limited supply of fissionable \nmaterials. (Source) pointed out that the Russians have some very capable scientists in the field of atomic energy and that, in \naddition thereto, they took into their custody some of the most-advanced and capable scientists of the German nation.— \n\nBut why worry at all if the wartime German scientists were such nuclear bunglers? Unless, of course, one recalls that Baron Manfred \nVon Ardenne had hit upon the idea of using cyclotrons for enriching uranium. \n\nThen Redfem delivers some bombshells. \n\nThe first is a report delivered to the FBI in the summer of 1947 - the year of the alleged Roswell crash and recovery, as well as of \nthe alleged founding of MJ-12 - by one of its informants, a Mr. Edwin M. Bailey of Stamford, Connecticut. Bailey’s comments were \nthe subject of the following memorandum to the FBI’s director, J. Edgar Hoover: \n\nBailey stated that the topic of ‘flying suacers’ had caused considerable comment and concern to the present day scientists and \nindicated that he himself had a personal theory concerning the ‘flying saucers.” Prior to advancing his own theory, Bailey \nremarked that immediately after the conclusion of World War II, a friend of his (censored), allegedly observed the “flying \nsaucers” from an observatory in Milan and Bologna, Italy. He stated that apparently at that time the “flying saucers” had caused \na little comment in Italy but that after some little publicity they immediately died out as public interest. Bailey stated that it is \nquite possible that actually the “flying saucers” could be radio controlled germ bombs or atom bombs which are circling the \norbit of the earth and which could be controlled by radio and directed to land on any designated target at the specific desire of \nthe agency or country operating the bombs.— \n\n\nFBI UFO Document \n\n\ncun \n\n\nG \n\n\nutctfr ti-i-yi \n\n\nMOV 7 \n\nJIUtTYM \n\n*-»» w ist mne \n\n\n\n\ntdIiuctoi r»i ' \n\nnon IAC, KTROIT »T / \n\n\nuukntitici Tlyinc OAJtcn, is - i \n\n\n/ •’ \n\n\nusutil mov six ^sst. \n\n\n\n\nI . \n\n\nmaisam, Mum, m s ttpua ?w \n\nHAT, MINX TUX TOITY TMO, UNTI l .*U*V1I* Of MIXITXIM JOWXJTJ L 1 ?-, \n\nunni or hat no, mi«txxn nrnrow, as sp, u \n\n*■ _ jiMK_iirni»U¥- \n\nADV1IID THAT MMU CtllUJI TOM DUIINC MINtTUN TOSTYTOW^ 0>lfl_Y£D_ \nA MIH1CU OCSCftlStD AS CUCULAI IN SNATt, STVtHTT fl« TO OMX \n(DNDIXD TAItt Ix-DIAXITII, ATTICXIHATIlT TiulTttx TttT MCI.

But that anyone could orbit \nthem on remotely-guided satellites was still only an idea on the drawing boards, though it had been on the Nazis’ drawing boards \nlong before anyone it was on anyone else’s. \n\nIn November of 1957, however, the FBI received one of its most interesting reports in its Detroit office. Barring the FBI’s \ncensoring of the name of the witness in the report, the report itself is extremely significant, since it is the eyewitness testimony of a \nPolish prisoner-of-war to the extraordinary technology he saw being tested by the Germans: \n\n(Witness was) bom February 19, 1926, in the State of Warsaw, Poland, (and) was brought from Poland as a Prisoner of War to \nGut Alt Golssen approximately 30 miles east of Berlin, Germany, in May, 1942, where he remained until a few weeks after the \nend of World War II. He spent the following years at Displaced Persons Camps at Kork, Strasburg, Offenburg, Milheim and \nFreiburg, Germany. He attended a radio technician school at Freiburg and for about a year was employed in a textile mill at \nLaurachbaden, Germany. He arrived in the united States at New York, May 2, 1951, via the “SS General Stewart” as a \nDisplaced Person... \n\nAccording to (witness), during 1944, month not recalled, while enroute to work in a field a short distance north of Gut Alt \nGolssen, their tractor engine stalled on a road through a swamp area. No machinery or other vehicle was then visible although a \nnoise was heard described as a high-pitched whine similar to that produced by a large electric generator. \n\nAn “SS” guard appeared and talked briefly with the German driver of the tractor, who waited five to ten minutes, after which \nthe noise stopped and the tractor engine was started normally. Approximately 3 hours later in the same swamp area, but away \nfrom the road where the work crew was cutting “hay,” he surreptitiously, because of the German in charge of the crew and \n“SS” guards in the otherwise deserted area, observed a circular enclosure approximately 100 to 150 yards in diameter protected \nfrom viewers by a tarpaulin-type wall approximately 50 feet high, from which a vehicle was observed to slowly rise vertically \nto a height sufficient to clear the wall and then to move slowly horizontally a short distance out of his view, which was \nobstructed by nearby trees. \n\n\nFBI UFO Document \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmm urannr or n. .a \n\nntau nibi or omimiTiM \n\n\nBui, llort* \nI, INI \n\n\n% * \n• • . 4 - \n\n\nATXOV OaKmiBQ \n\nA),yJ,.

Nor is a Polish prisoner of war likely to be eager to fabricate anything that would make the Nazis look good. \n\nAccording to Redfem, a similar account, dated June 8, 1967, also was found in the FBI’s declassified UFO files. It reads as \nfollows: \n\nOn April 26, 1967, (source) appeared at the Miami Office and furnished the following information relating to an object, \npresently referred to as an unidentified flying object, he allegedly photographed during November, 1944. \n\nSometime during 1943, he graduated from the German Air Academy and was assigned as a member of the Luftwaffe on the \nRussian Front. Near the end of 1944, he was released from this duty and was assigned as a test pilot to a top secret project in \nthe Black Forest of Austria. During this period he observed the aircraft described above. It was saucer shaped, about twenty- \none feet in diameter, radio-controlled, and mounted several jet engines around the exterior portion of the craft. He further \ndescribed the exterior portion as revolving around the dome in the center which remained stationary. It was (witness’s) \nresponsibility to photograph the object while in flight. He asserted he was able to retain a negative of a photograph he made at \n7,000 meters (20,000 feet). \n\nAccording to (witness) the above aircraft was designed and engineered by a German engineer whose present whereabouts is \nunknown to him. (Witness) also assumed the secrets pertaining to this aircraft were captured by Allied Forces. He said this type \nof aircraft was responsible for the downing of at least one American B-26 airplane.— \n\nClearly at least some in the US government’s many intelligence agencies were interested in the possibility of Nazi origins for some \nof the observed UFOs that began invading American airspace after World War Two. \n\nThese documents, unlike the Cooper-Cantwheel MAJIC-12 documents, are undeniably authentic. One does not have to place \nthem in a gray area between “genuine” and “complete hoax” to appreciate their significance. And this should give one pause, for \nthey corroborate what those MAJIC-12 themselves seem to imply: that someone, somewhere, in the confusing tangle of US \nintelligence agencies, was keeping track of the Nazi angle on UFOs, and that they were perhaps worried about a continued \n\n\n\n\n\nindependent covert development of the exotic technology they displayed. The documents that Redfem uncovers in fact corroborate \nthe general scenarios outlined in our own examination and analysis of the Cooper-Cantwheel MAJIC-12 documents.— \n\nHowever one slices it, there is a clear documentary indication of Nazi association with the development of at least some of the \ntechnology associated with UFO technology. \n\nBut more extraordinary is that one detects, at various levels, all the elements involved in Kennedy’s assassination. And that may \nbe significant in and of itself, an indicator, perhaps, that the “Brotherhood’s” involvement in the murder was ultimately motivated by \ntechnological considerations, and financially backed by the world’s largest — and well known — corporations. This surely was not \nthe only motivation for the assassination, but, in alliance with threatened “big oil” and banking interests, it was a powerful one. If \nKennedy had been successful in smashing the CIA or in joint space cooperation with the Soviets, then this might have exposed a \nhidden secret space program and its secret technology. \n\nIn this context, recall that one of the MAJIC-12 documents indicated that President Nixon privatized the alleged secret UFO \nstudy-and-action group. In this context, it is perhaps apparent, that there was not really any reason for him to do so. It had been \nindependent since the end of the war. \n\nBut ultimately, what was at stake, beyond this technology and the power it represented? \n\nOne answer, perhaps, was allegedly given by Dr. Wemer Von Braun himself to his former assistant at Fairchild Industries, Dr. \nCarol Rosin. Von Braun had retired — or perhaps had “been retired” — to Fairchild Industries from NASA after his Lunar Neutral \nPoint discrepancy revelations to Time magazine. Rosin describes Von Braun’s “dying message” to her: \n\nWhen I was a Corporate Manager of Fairchild Industries from 1974 through 1977,1 met the late Dr. Wemer Von Braun. We \nfirst met in early 1974. At that time, Von Braun was dying of cancer but he assured me that he would live a few more years to \ntell me about the game that was being played — that game being the effort to weaponize space, to control the Earth from space \nand space itself. Von Braun had a history of working with weapons systems. He escaped from Germany— to come to this \ncountry and became a Vice President of Fairchild Industries, when I had met him. Von Braun’s purpose during the last years of \nhis life, his dying years, was to educate the public and decision-makers about why space-based weapons are dumb, dangerous, \ndestabilizing, too costly, unnecessary, unworkable, and an undesirable idea, and about the alternatives that are available. \n\nAs practically a deathbed speech, he educated me about those concepts and who the players were in this game. He gave me \nthe responsibility, since he was dying, of continuing this effort to prevent the weaponization of outer space. When Wemer Von \nBraun was dying of cancer, he asked me to be his spokesperson, to appear on occasions when he was too ill to speak. I did this. \n\nWhat was most interesting to me was a repetitive sentence that he said to me over and over again during the approximately \nfour years that I had the opportunity to work with him. He said the strategy that was being used to educate the public and \ndecision makers was to use scare tactics. That was how we identify an enemy. \n\nThe strategy that Wemer Von Braun taught me was that first the Russians are going to be considered to be the enemy. In \nfact, in 1974, they were the enemy, the identified enemy. We were told they had “killer satellites”. We were told that they were \ncoming to get us and control us — that they were “Commies.” \n\nThen terrorists would be identified, and that was soon to follow. We heard a lot about terrorism. Then we were going to \nidentify third-world country “crazies.” We now call them Nations of Concern. But he said that would be the third enemy \nagainst whom we would build space-based weapons. \n\nThe next enemy was asteroids. Now, at that point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. Asteroids - against asteroids \nwe are going to build space-based weapons. \n\nAnd the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over and \nover during the four years that I knew him and was giving speeches for him, he would bring up that last card. “And remember, \nCarol, the last card is the alien card. We are going to have to build space-based weapons against aliens, and all of it is a lie. \n\n\nThe last card that was being held was the extraterrestrial enemy card. The intensity with which he said that, made me realize \nthat he knew something that he was too afraid to mention. He was too afraid to talk about it. He would not tell me the details. I \nam not sure I would have absorbed them if he had told me the details or even believed him in 1974. But there was no question \nthat that man knew and had a need to know, I found out later.— \n\nRosin makes clear subsequently in her statements that she personally believes in extraterrestrials in the standard sense, that she also \nmakes clear her personal opposition to space-based weapons,— and does all this in a manner that suggests that Von Braun was \nimplying that “E.T.” was merely being misunderstood by a trigger-happy American military. In other words, the “lie” Von Braun \nreferred to was that “ET” was being covered up and misunderstood. \n\nBut it is not at all obvious from Von Braun’s alleged remarks to her that this is the only interpretation nor even the best one. After \nall, Von Braun had been part of the world’s first space program and the first attempt to weaponize space, a program that outlined, \n\n\n\nlong in advance of their realization, the steps necessary to place “killer satellites” in orbit: Nazi Germany’s. And Von Braun’s \nassociate at Peenemunde, Dr. Kurt Debus - a high voltage expert - was also involved with The Bell. Debus subsequently became a \ndirector at the Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida during the Apollo project, a strange position for an expert in high voltage to \nbe in during the world’s first manner Lunar landing program. Von Braun’s remarks might, therefore, be interpreted to mean a \nplanned deception, brought about by technology - the “ET Threat” - to be met with another deception, also brought about by \ntechnology: space-based weapons for “defense” against “ET” and the occasional large asteroid that wanders too close. And \nconsider, too, that if the weapons are powerful enough to blow apart a large asteroid, what might they do if directed against the \nearth? \n\nSo what does one make of all the Nazis lurking in the background of the JFK assassination? \n\nThe “Brotherhood,” like all the other weird players and connections - the anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia, the Cold Warriors in the \nCIA and the Pentagon and the FBI, big oil, international banking - had its reasons to act and to enter such a multifaceted conspiracy, \nperhaps even to orchestrate it. Like them, it was hiding something; like them, it was protecting something. \n\nMae Brussel was, after all is said and done, right about the Nazis and the assassination, for America has continued the slide to \nfascism. Dummycrats are indistinguishable from Republicrooks and one conspiracy-ridden scandal - Iran-Contra, October Surprise, \nWatergate, BCCI, the Savings and Loan debacle, Nugan Hand, Ruby Ridge, Waco, Oklahoma City, 9/11 - follows and blurs into \nanother. Elections are rigged by computer ballots, constitutional crises are tried on for size in Florida, two presidential candidates \nfrom the same secret society ran for president while the “winner”, a “conservative”, allows millions of illegal aliens to pour across \nthe borders while claiming to fight a war on terror with a camera on every stoplight in America. \n\nIf, with the distance of time from the event, the players in the JFK murder now seem to blur and mn together, perhaps that is due \nnot to our failing eyesight or faded memories, but to the fact that the coalescence of interests that brought that conspiracy together \nhave merely continued to coalesce. They will continue to do so, as long as there is a technology that threatens their base of power, a \ntechnology - and a science - that needs to be suppressed, controlled, and weaponized. They have merely exchanged the black and \nsilver SS uniform for the charcoal grey business suit. \n\n....but be sure and check their ring fingers. And make sure they’re not holding the apron strings. Old fraternities die hard. \n\n\n\n„Bibliography“ \n\n\nAgoston, Tom. Blunder! How the U.S. Gave Away Nazi Supersecrets to Russia. New York.

Witkowski’s research in The Truth about the Wunderwajfe, like Carter \nHydrick’s in Critical Mass, is first class and simply put, cannot and must not be ignored by any serious inquirer into the alternative \nand secret history of World War Two secret weapons and technology. I state this simply to put the record straight, since a number of \nstupid and utterly silly remarks have been made about Mr. Witkowski in various reviews of Nick Cook’s The Hunt for Zero Point. \nThese reviews have tried to impeach Cook’s story by, in some cases, implying that Mr. Witkowski’s work was somehow slip shod \nor second rate. The persons making such comments have obviously never bothered to read Mr. Witkowski’s work nor considered its \nprofound implications. So, once again, to set the record straight, Mr. Witkowski’s work is superb and magisterial. The reviewers \nimplying that Mr. Witkowski is an “unknown” or a second-rate author might possibly be in the covert employment of somebody’s \n(Hot) Air Force. \n\n13 \n\nWitkowski, op. cit., p. 224. \n\n14 \nIbid. \n\n15 \n\nProject Lusty, Frame 601, cited in Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwajfe, p. 226. \n\n16 \n\nProject Lusty, Frame 597, § 9, cited in Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe. p. 226, emphasis Witkowski’s. \n\n11 \n\nQ.v.

The names of the rockets designed by (Werner Von Braun) at this times \nwere the Redstone and Jupiter. Although the old arsenal in which he worked at Huntsville was called Redstone, it is an interesting \ncoincidence that Mars is also the red plant. Jupiter, associated with war and victory, is the Roman name for the god that the Greeks \ncalled Zeus, who was the father of Apollo.” \n\n56 \n\nGeorg, Star Wars, p. 29. \n\n57 \nIbid. \n\n58 \n\nIbid., pp. 30-31. \n\n59 \n\nFarrell, Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 70-80. \n\n60 \n\nGeorge, Star Wars 1947, p. 36, my translation. This illustrates another facet of the German secret programs, one overlooked by most \nauthors, namely, that unlike other countries, it appears that the Nazis gave the formal order for the development of these weapons \nafter a test had been successfully completed. Thus, the order to “develop” such weapons should not be taken as an order to establish \nthe research necessary to bring them to realization, but rather as the order to bring them to production. It is thus noteworthy that \nHitler signs the order to “develop” the atomic bomb after the alleged test in Riigen occurs. The same, in fact, could be said of the V- \n2, for it is only after Hitler sees films of the rocket being successfully launched that he gives the order to develop it. \n\n61 \n\nSee Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 191-193. \n\n62 \n\nGeorg, Star Wars 1947, p. 75. \n\n63 \n\nIbid., p. 76. \n\n64 \n\n\nGeorg, Star Wars 1947, pp. 76-77. \n\n65 \n\nFarrell, Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 80-88. \n\n66 \n\nGeorg, Star Wars 1947, p. 79.

But the debris never made it to the \nbase, as the twin engine bomber flying it inexplicably crashed. \n\n91 \n\nThis is an inaccuracy, since the Nazi government was not formed until President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Reich Chancellor and \nasked him to form a government on January 30, 1933. \n\n92 \n\nNASA, Nazis, and JFK: The Torbitt Document and the JFK Assassination, pp. 24-27. \n\n93 \n\nI should make it clear that I do not believe the Warren Commission version of the assassination, and do believe that a conspiracy was \ninvolved, one that most likely was composed of at least the elements outlined here. \n\n94 \n\nThe American Council of Christian Churches did publish literature against theological liberalism as well as funded missionaries in \nCentral and South America.

The Russians allegedly developed it as a means of detonating hydrogen bombs without the \nneed for an a-bomb, thus creating a “clean” hydrogen bomb, still capable of taking out large cities in an enormous explosion, but \nleaving a much smaller radiation fallout signature. \n\n141 \n\nLyne, Pentagon Aliens, pp. 99-100. \n\n142 \n\nSee chapter four of the present book, as well as Reich of the Black Sun, p. 335. \n\n143 \n\nWilliam Lyne, Occult Ether Phsyics: Tesla’s Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal 7r(Lamy, New \nMexico: Creatopia Productions, 2003), pp. 1-2. \n\n144 \n\nOver the next few pages the spelling of “aether” varies.

What is unique in Lyne’s interpretation is the \ndriving and unifying motivation that he claims to detect in Tesla’s work. As we shall see, Lyne argues his case well. \n\n151 \n\nLyne, op. cit., p. 30. \n\n152 \n\nLyne, Occult Ether Physics, p. 31. \n\n153 \n\nsee Lyne, Occult Ether Physics, pp. 48-66. See especially the important remark Lyne makes on p. 58, in the context of the \ndiscussion of Tom Bearden’s views on “scalar” or “quantum potential” physics in chapter five. Lyne states “There was already a sort \nof battle brewing between the proponents of classical electrodynamics, and the proponents led by Maxwell of an electromagnetic \ntheory of light. To the former, conductivity occurred in metal wires, etc., while with Maxwell, it occurred in the surrounding \ndielectrics and ether-filled space, with the conductors serx’ing only to ‘guide’ the action. ” (Emphasis added). This is to say that \nelectrical circuits are not closed systems but open systems, and act as local “structures” and transducers of the medium and its \nenergy, a view well in keeping with Bearden’s insights. \n\n154 \n\n\nIbid.., pp. 31-32, bold emphasis Lyne’s, italicized emphasis added. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n155 \n\nFor the sake of clarity, I will refer to William Thomson as Lord Kelvin, so as not to confuse him in the reader’s mind with J.J. \nThomson. \n\n156 \n\nProceedings of the Royal Society, viii [1856], p. 150, cited in Lyne, Occult Ether Physics, p. 54. \n\n157 \n\nLyne, op. cit., p. 54. \n\n158 \n\nIbid., citing F.

Lyne also makes the trenchant observation that \nLord Kelvin’s experiments were “analogical ones,” being designed to “use mechanical and electrical wave methods to construct a \nmodel to probe the gravitational, inertial and momentive reactions of solid bodies in the ether.” (pp. 54-55). \n\n160 \n\nLyne, Occult Ether Physics, p. 55, citing Repe rto rium d.

Tesla himself stated that he viewed the basic wave structure of the aether as longitudinal and acoustic in nature, with the \n“sound” waves traveling at the velocity of light. Moreover, Tesla also viewed radioactivity as environmental and hence a dynamic \nphenomenon, and not as an “inherent” property of certain types of unstable matter.

If this were found to be true of the Soviet program as well as the American then this would constitute evidence \nof secret coordination of both programs along the same ideological inspiration, whatever that inspiration may be. \n\n265 \n\nIt does not lack a clear connection to Nazism either before, during, or after the war, as will be seen in a subsequent chapter. \n\n266 \n\nIt goes without saying that not much at all is known of Germany’s Bundesnachrichtendienst. It alone, of all the major intelligence \nagencies of the world, unlike the Israeli Mossad, the Soviet KGB, the British MI-6, the French Surete or even Chinese intelligence, \nhas had next to nothing written about its successes and/or failures, other than General Gehlen’s own memoirs. \n\n267 \n\nIgor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwajfe, translated from the Polish by Bruce Wenham, (Famborough, England: Books \nInternational and European History Press, 2003) p. 284. \n\n268 \n\nIt should be pointed out that Geoffrey Brooks’ book, Hitler’s Terror Weapons, also contains information about the Bell.

Then the trace comes to an end - there was no \naircraft, and no Kammler. Although he was intensively hunted after the war, he completely ‘vanished’. The opinion prevails that \nonly one of the superpowers could have so effectively hidden a high-ranking SS general. It is known from other sources that the \nAmericans (Patton’s Army) drove a wedge deep into Czechoslovakia among other reasons to reach the employees and documents \nof Kammler’s ‘department’ and lengthily interrogated all of them. These materials are to this day kept top secret. This is very \nintriguing and once again points to the ‘American trail. (The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 289, emphasis added). \n\n283 \n\nWitkowski observes that Debus was crucial in the project for the “separation of magnetic fields component,” (The Truth About the \nWunderwaffe, p. 238). This is highly significant, given Debus’ subsequent post-war employment by NASA at the Kennedy Space \nCenter, and given the allegations of some that there are two spaces programs, one a very covert one employing exotic - and \nsuppressed - technology. \n\n284 \n\nWitkowski does mention that according to his sources, Gerlach did speak a great deal in the Farm Hall Transcripts about magnetic \nfields, atomic nuclei, the earth’s gravitation, and “extraterrestrial space.” (The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 255). If this is true \nthen it puts a whole other perspective on the classification of the Farm Hall Transcripts and why they remained classified for so long. \nPerhaps Gerlach’s comments also caused him to be brought to this country after his internment in England, since as has been seen, \nhe was subsequently interrogated in the U.S.A., where his wartime research diaries remain classified to this day. This would clearly \nimply that the U.S.A. knew something about these subjects more than it was willing to share with its British ally - and brought \nGerlach over to flesh out a full picture of the Bell. \n\n285 \n\nWitkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 235, emphasis added. \n\n286 \n\nWitkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 235. \n\n287 \n\nCarter Plymton Hydrick, Critical Mass: pp. 72-80.

The metallic taste is a signature of some close encounters with UFOs. UFOlogist Timothy Good \nproduces the following account of such an encounter by a German UFOlogist, Dr. Peter Hattwig, and his wife: “Suddenly, we heard \na clear humming sound coming from the sky. After three or four seconds this noise, which seemed ‘metallic’, as though produced by \na centrifugal force, grew louder....our bedroom and terrace outside was lit by something even more powerful than the moonlight - a \nbluish-white colour like neon lighting. At the saem time we both felt a strange metallic sort of taste on our tongues.” (Timothy \nGoode, Unearthly Disclosure: Conflicting Interests in the Control of Extraterrestrial Intelligence [Fondon: Arrow Books, 2000], \n48). \n\n326 \nIbid. \n\n327 \n\nIgor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 234. \n\n328 \nIbid. \n\n329 \n\nIbid., pp. 234-235. \n\n330 \n\nIbid., p. 263. \n\n331 \n\nIgor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 235. \n\n332 \nIbid. \n\n333 \n\nIbid., p. 245. \n\n334 \n\nIgor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 245, emphasis added. \n\n335 \n\nIbid., p. 257. \n\n336 \n\n\nIbid., p. 247. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n337 \nIbid. \n\n338 \n\nIbid., p. 249. \n\n339 \n\nIbid., emphasis added. \n\n340 \n\nIgor Witkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 250. \n\n341 \nIbid. \n\n342 \n\nWitkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 251. \n\n343 \n\nWikowski cites Japanese experiments in this regard, but one might also point to the various experiments of physicist Di Palma. \n\n344 \n\nWitkowski, The Truth About the Wunderwaffe, p. 253. Burkhardt Heim was a well-known and respected physicist and peace \nadvocate in Germany before his death. Almost nothing is said about him in this country, but it is significant that his work was \nmentioned by Leonard G. Cramp in his well-known UFO classic UFOs and Anti-Gravity: Piece, for a Jig-Saw (Kempton: \nAdventures Unlimted Press, 1966), pp. 94, 110. \n\nGravitational research is, in one respect, obviously the motivation and purpose of the Bell. In his recent July 23, 2005 \ncorrespondence with the author, Witkowski also makes another connection that is well worth pondering. Connecting the idea of \n“magnetic fields separation” with atomic spin polarization, Witkowski then goes on to state: \n\n“We know from contemporary references that the ‘separation’ may be achieved in various ways, like by a superconductor or \nthrough a so called pinch in plasma. As I interpreted this, it may refer to a relativistic isolation of a “reference frame”. It’s an \nidea that has been derived from Einstein’s theory, before the Second World War. NASA has launched the Gravity Probe B \nspacecraft last year (which has fast spinning balls surrounded by a material superconducting in this temperature, in order to \nisolate the magnetic field, therefore to basically verify the same effect only that without plasma.) They quoted a different \nreference however: the theory developed in Germany and Austria before the war mostly by Hans Thining, a theory of \nspacetime and gravity which takes into account such a “separation” - if not for NASA, the work would be largely forgotten.” \n\nWitkowski also mentions in his letter that Thining was a close associate of Dr Walther Gerlach. \n\n345 \n\nFriedrich Mattem, UFO’s: Nazi Secret Weapon?

As for the SS and fusion research, German researcher Karl-Heinz Zunneck states that fusion energy was one area \nof the SS’s investigations, though he does not indicate how far it had pressed this research (see Karl Heinz Zunneck, \nGeheimtechnologien, Wunderwaffe und die irdischen Facetten des UFO-Phdnomens, Schleusingen, Germany: Amun Verlag, \n2002), p. 151.) \n\n362 \n\nI realize that at this juncture the term “quantum coherence” seems to have little to do with cold fusion, but will expand the term to a \nmore accurate description later. Suffice it to say that the only viable explanations for the anomalous excess energy present in cold \nfusion experiments is that some aspect of the vacuum energy has been cohered and entered the experiments via mechanisms not yet \nfully understood. \n\n363 \n\nBernstein would certainly know of cold fusion, so his mystification may reflect rather his own adherence to that school of “public \nconsumption physics” that rejects a priori any validity to cold fusion claims, since they represent an “open systems” paradigm and \napproach to COP > 1 systems. \n\n364 \n\nQ.v., Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 287-309. \n\n365 \n\nIbid., p. 306. \n\n366 \n\nIbid., pp. 306-307. \n\n367 \n\nMayer and Mehner, Das Geheimnis der deutschen Atombombe, p. 89., emphasis added.

Q.v. his last two comprehensive books on the subject, Fer De Lance: Brie/ing on Soviet \nScalar Electromagnetic Weapons( Santa Barbada, California: Cheniere Press, 2002). and the highly technical tome Energy from the \nVacuum: Concepts and Principle s(Sant?L Barbada, California: Cheniere Press, 2002). The latter work is a superb introduction, by a \ncredentialed scientist of great intellectual caliber, to the physics of cohering the Zero Point Energy. \n\n370 \n\nQ.v. Joseph P.

The appearance of such globes of light is one piece of evidence that Bearden often \ncites as a signature of scalar weapons in their various defensive modes of operation. \n\n416 \n\nBearden, FerDe Lance, pp. 15-16 \n\n417 \n\nQ.v. Joseph P. Farrell, The Giza Death Star Deployed, pp. 99-104. Bearden makes the astonishing, and quite disturbing, assertion in \nFer De Lance that the notorious Japanese yakuza — the Japanese “mafia” with its own neofascist and neo-imperialist ideology - has \nrecently acquired scalar weapons. In effect, this means that Japan has, since the yakuza is intimately connected to the mainsprings of \nJapanese economic and governmental power. \n\n418 \n\nIn the previous book on Nazi Secret weapons, however, I mentioned that it is my strong belief, based on the evidence presented in \nZdenek Cervenka’s and Barbara Rogers’ book The Nuclear Axis: the Secret Collaboration Between West Germany and South \nAfrica, documenting that it was in fact West Germany that was the technological source behind South Africa’s and Israel’s \ndevelopment of the atom bomb. \n\n419 \n\nOf course, this is not the official German government explanation for its decision. The official explanation is couched in the \npolitically acceptable currency that the decision was taken for “environmental reasons.” This is not to say that this was not a genuine \nfactor in the German government’s decision, but only to say that it was probably not the ultimate motivation. \n\n420 \n\nEarthquakes, it will be recalled, are a signature of the use of a scalar weapon in its lowest thresholds of destructive potential. \n\n421 \n\nThat Germany seems the obvious choice only requires a moment’s reflection. Other than Russia, one cannot honestly maintain that \nFrance or Great Britain would have been in a terrible hurry to see Germany reunified. Japan, China, and the U.S. would have been \nmost likely indifferent to it. Israel would have been implacably hostile but probably ultimately acquiescent, and South Africa \napathetic or perhaps mildly hostile. Only Brazil may have had some sympathy for the reunification, given its own reliance on \nGerman scientists in its own scalar program. But in the final analysis, if those unusually destructive earthquakes were induced, then \nthe finger points to scalar weapons, and to Germany, as to no other. \n\n422 \n\nBearden, Fer De Lance, p. 35. \n\n423 \n\nNamely, Israel and South Africa. \n\n424 \n\nBearden, Fer De Lance, pp. 353-354, emphasis added. \n\n425 \n\nThis permits another speculative reconstruction of history. It is known that Chancellor Adenauer agreed to re-arm West Germany \nand undertook by treaty with the United States, France, and Great Britain, not to build atomic, biological, or chemical weapons on \nGerman soil as a condition of re-armament. What is little known, of course, is that Adenauer made it very clear to the other Western \nAllies that Germany, as a sovereign nation, would not hesitate to develop such weapons if the international situation required it. \nMight the motivations for Adenauer’s acquiescence, then, have been that the West German government already knew of the \npossibility of weapons far more destructive and far cheaper than atomic and thermonuclear weapons? Clearly it did, for it strains \ncredibility to think that with so many former Nazis in his government, not to mention General Reinhard Gehlen’s extensive left-over- \nfrom-the war spy network, that they were totally oblivious to the possibilities, nor oblivious to the accomplishments of SS General \nKammler’s black projects “think tank.” \n\nIt likewise strains credibility that any self-respecting German government would rely on the good graces of Britain, France, or the \nUnited States to ensure its security. As Cervenka’s and Rogers’ book on the West German bomb makes abundantly clear, the West \nGerman government very early on undertook the quiet and very secret development of its own independent nuclear deterrent under \nthe very nose of the NATO Alliance while at the same time presenting a posture of perfectly correct “nuclear weapons abjuration” \nand, when the German media came too close to these projects, outright denials in the teeth of clear evidence to the contrary. \nSimilarly, the Schmidt government heavily financed the private German firm OTRAG’s “corporate Area 51” preserve in Zaire to the \ntune of several millions of Deutschmarks (q.v. Reich of the Black Sun, pp. 268- 269). The purpose of this preserve? What has been \nadmitted is that it was to research biological weapons and cruise missiles. One can only assume that this is the tip of the iceberg. So, \nin the end, Bearden may be right that the Vela satellites detected not an atom bomb test, but a scalar weapons test. He merely missed \nthe ultimate political significance of the test, namely, that behind Israel and South Africa, there was a much more powerful hidden \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplayer: Germany. \n\n426 \n\nGerry Vassilatos, Declassified Patents of the Cold War and SDI: Companion Study Guide for “Secrets of Cold War Technology” \n(Bayside, California: Borderland Sciences, 1997), Section 1.1.

Farrell, Reich of the Black Sun (Kempton, Illinois: Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004), p. 335. \n\n480 \n\nThe reason that an atom bomb is required as a “trigger” in a conventional hydrogen bomb is that, according to standard nuclear and \nthermonuclear theory, the enormous heat and pressures required to initiate fusion reactions can only be achieved by an atom bomb, \nwhich heats the atoms of deuterium and tritium - heavy hydrogen isotopes with one and two extra neutrons in their nuclei \nrespectively - with enough energy to cause enough of them to collide and fuse into helium atoms, with a corresponding tremendous \nexplosive release of energy and burst of neutrons. The neutrons which are not required by the helium atom are “kicked out” to form \na deadly, but short-lived radiation. Thus, most of the long-lived radiation in a conventional hydrogen bomb comes not from the \nfusion reaction, but from the fission reaction of the atomic bomb that triggers the hydrogen bomb. \n\n481 \n\nSam Cohen, “The Dove of War,” National Review (December 17, 1995, 56-58,76), p. 56. \n\n482 \nIbid. \n\n483 \nIbid. \n\n484 \n\nSam Cohen, “The Dove of War,” p. 56.,emphasis added. \n\n485 \n\nI.e., the energy of the explosive “shock” or pressure wave. \n\n486 \n\nSam Cohen, “The Dove of War,” p. 56. \n\n487 \nIbid. \n\n488 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIbid. \n\n489 \n\nSam Cohen, “The Dove of War,” p. 57, emphasis added. \n\n490 \n\nIbid., p. 97. \n\n491 \nIbid. \n\n492 \nIbid. \n\n493 \n\nQ.v. my Reich of the Black Sun, chapter 4. \n\n494 \n\nThe largest hydrogen bomb ever tested was done by the Soviet Union, which tested a deliverable weapon with a yield of 67 \nmegatons in 1962! \n\n495 \n\nFor this story, see Peter Hounam and Steve McQuillan’s The Mini-Nuke Conspiracy: Mandela’s Nuclear Nightmare (Viking: 1995), \nISBN 0-670-96925- 2. \n\n496 \n\nHoumam and McQuillan note that Russian spy satellite kept a busy eye on (West) Germany’s version of Area 51, a secret preserve \nin Zaire, central Africa, run by the German firm OTRAG (Orbital Transport and Rockets, AG, a (West) German company involved \nin cruise missile research. According to Hounam and McQuillan, the Russians also knew a great deal about the extent of South \nAfrica’s nuclear bomb program. “This may,” they observe, “be connected with a spy swap that took place in 1969 between Moscow \nand Bonn. According to Chinese (!) intelligence sources, several West Germans held in the Soviet Union were swapped with Soviet \nspy Victor Loginov. The puzzling aspect of this is that Loginov had been caught spying in South Africa and had been secretly \nhanded over to the West Germans.”(p. 141). Consequently, once again, the finger points back to West Germany, and not Israel, as \nthe real technological broker for South Africa’s nuclear bomb development. The implication is clear: West Germany was using \nSouth Africa as a proxy state to develop its own nuclear arsenal, maintaining a strict adherence to the letter, while simultaneously \ncircumventing the spirit of its NATO treaty obligations. This is not to cast aspersions on the West German government for doing so, \nfor no power in its position would rationally rely on the good graces of its former enemies, France, Great Britain, the United States, \nor the Soviet Union, in the threat of a war or nuclear exchange between East and West. \n\n497 \n\nSverdlovsk has been re-named to its pre-revolutionary name of Ekaterinburg.

The fact that the reactors caught fire and were barely able to be put out, in a kind of proto-Chemobyl meltdown, is \nbased on the assumption that Heisenberg was attempting to construct a conventional reactor. But as a close examination of the \nexperiments and aims he was trying to achieve will demonstrate, Heisenberg, like his Manhattan Project counterparts, was “tickling \nthe dragon’s tail” and attempting to measure neutron cross-sections, all for the probable purpose of obtaining “the next best thing”, \nnamely, an atomic “fizzle” bomb, or “semi-fission” bomb. In that respect, Heisenberg’s experiments were very successful, and \ndoubtless pointed the way to quick achievement of such a bomb. Such a bomb, moreover, placed in the warhead of a V-2, would \nnot require the heavy mechanism of a cannon shooting the critical mass together, since it could be assembled by the sheer kinetic \nenergy of the impact of the warhead on the ground, thus creating the “fizzle” explosion, one much larger than the largest \nconventional bombs, but one still short of the Hiroshima or Nagasaki atom bombs. Precisely just such a concept is behind German \natom bomb designs from that period. The following diagram, in fact, is reproduced in Samuel Goudsmit’s book as a demonstration \nof the “failure” of German atom bomb physics during the war, since such a device is unlikely to have fissioned completely: \n\n519 \n\nQ.v..

      "text": "EDIT\n00esk.jpg\nCase File: Lake Anjikuni Village\nLocation: Lake Anjikuni, Nunavut, Canada\nDate: 1930\nDescription: Anjikuni Lake is one of several lakes located along the Kazan River in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, Canada. The lake's shore is notable for rocky outcroppings of the Precambrian Shield, being part of the Hearne Domain, Western Churchill province of the Churchill Craton. Caribou migrate through the area, and the lake contains trout, pike, and Arctic grayling.\nCase\nHistory: On a cold November day in 1930, Canadian fur trapper Joe Labelle was traveling near Anjikuni Lake in the Northwest Territory of Canada, now part of the modern Nunavut territory. Aware of a Inuit settlement in the area, he entered the community looking for lodging and found it completely deserted. In his search, he found meals that had been started and left abandoned, empty huts left stocked with food and personal possessions, a recent fire left smoldering, a discarded repair of a junior sealskin that had yet to be completed and no signs of a struggle that would have explained the whereabouts of the people. Whatever had happened had forced the entire settlement to abandon the location. There were no tracks and the most gruesome discovery was the reason for the absence of the dogs. Every single one of them had starved to death. Food, arms, and clothing had all been abandoned.\nLabelle continued onward to the closest telegraph office located several miles further on and reported his encounter to the Mounted Police (RCMP) to launch an official investigation. Their investigation took testimony from a trapper named Armand Laurent and his two sons. When questioned, they said they saw a large cylindrical object that transformed into a bullet shape before heading toward Anjikuni Lake. At the village, the RCMP found the kayaks still sat on the beach, meals still hung over long-dead cooking fires and the frozen bodies of the villagers' dogs. They also found that every grave in the burial ground had been opened and emptied. The headstones had been neatly stacked in piles on either side of the graves, ruling out animals as the culprits.\nThe RCMP eventually concluded that the Inuit people had been missing for about eight weeks prior to Labelle’s arrival, but they never came up with an answer as to why the entire settlement had abandoned the location.\nBackground: The earliest recorded publication about Anjikuni Lake is a 1976 citation of an article from November 29, 1930, written by an Emmett E. Kelleher in an article in \"The Bee\" from Danville, Virginia, later confused with the Halifax Herald newspaper.\nInvestigations: Brian Dunning of the Skeptoid website researched this case and traced it back to the November 29, 1930 article written by Kelleher. He remarked several inconsistencies in the original story, such as the fact that the missing Inuit kayaks would not be \"battered by wave action\" during a time the lake was frozen. He also noted that the supposed population of the village increased in size in later re-tellings and other facts became embellished as well. The three trappers and their description of a UFO was first mentioned in print in the book, \"World's Greatest UFO Mysteries\" by Nigel Blundell and Roger Boar. Furthermore, no physical evidence exists of a village at Angikuni Lake, and nobody has ever published an account of going up there and clearing away any remnants.\nExtra Notes: This case was developed solely for this site; it has yet to appear on Unsolved Mysteries.\nResults: Solved. Dunning believed this story was invented by Frank Edwards for his 1959 book, \"Stranger Than Science,\" when he could not find a copy of original Halifax Herald newspaper article. However, researchers eventually traced it to the \"The Bee\" newspaper from Danville, Virginia. This is the earliest version of the story. Although Joe Labelle was a real person, there has been no verification of him ever coming across a real village. The RCMP has had numerous requests for their notes on the case, but no such evidence of such an investigation has ever been found.",

The island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, which were created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.\n\nExperts disagree on when the island's Polynesian inhabitants first reached the island. While many in the research community cited evidence that they arrived around the year 800, there is compelling evidence presented in a 2007 study that places their arrival closer to 1200.[3][4] The inhabitants created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island's numerous enormous stone moai and other artifacts. However, land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation.[3] By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000. European diseases, Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s, and emigration to other islands such as Tahiti further depleted the population, reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877.[5]\n\nChile annexed Easter Island in 1888. In 1966, the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship. In 2007 the island gained the constitutional status of \"special territory\" (Spanish: territorio especial). Administratively, it belongs to the Valparaíso Region, constituting a single commune (Isla de Pascua) of the Province of Isla de Pascua.[6] The 2017 Chilean census registered 7,750 people on the island, of whom 3,512 (45%) considered themselves Rapa Nui.[7]\n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.[8] The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, 2,075 kilometres (1,289 mi) away;[9] the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, 2,606 km (1,619 mi) away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, 3,512 km (2,182 mi) away.\n\n\nContents\n1\tEtymology\n2\tHistory\n2.1\tIntroduction\n2.2\tRapa Nui settlement\n2.3\tEuropean contact\n2.4\t19th century\n2.5\t20th century\n2.6\t21st century\n2.7\tIndigenous rights movement\n3\tGeography\n3.1\tGeology\n3.2\tClimate\n4\tEcology\n5\tCulture\n5.1\tMythology\n5.2\tStone work\n5.2.1\tStatues\n5.2.2\tStone platforms\n5.2.3\tStone walls\n5.2.4\tStone houses\n5.2.5\tPetroglyphs\n5.2.6\tCaves\n5.2.7\tOther stones\n5.3\tRongorongo\n5.4\tWood carving\n5.5\t21st-century culture\n5.5.1\tSports\n5.6\tTapati Festival\n6\tDemographics\n6.1\t2012 census\n6.2\tDemographic history\n6.3\tLanguages\n7\tAdministration and legal status\n8\tNotable people\n9\tTransportation\n10\tGallery\n11\tSee also\n12\tReferences\n13\tBibliography\n14\tFurther reading\n15\tExternal links\nEtymology\nThe name \"Easter Island\" was given by the island's first recorded European visitor, the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, who encountered it on Easter Sunday (5 April) in 1722, while searching for \"Davis Land\".[10] Roggeveen named it Paasch-Eyland (18th-century Dutch for \"Easter Island\").[11][12] The island's official Spanish name, Isla de Pascua, also means \"Easter Island\".\n\nThe current Polynesian name of the island, Rapa Nui (\"Big Rapa\"), was coined after the slave raids of the early 1860s, and refers to the island's topographic resemblance to the island of Rapa in the Bass Islands of the Austral Islands group.[13] However, Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl argued that Rapa was the original name of Easter Island and that Rapa Iti was named by refugees from there.[14]\n\nThe phrase Te pito o te henua has been said to be the original name of the island since French ethnologist Alphonse Pinart gave it the romantic translation \"the Navel of the World\" in his Voyage à l'Île de Pâques, published in 1877.[15] William Churchill (1912) inquired about the phrase and was told that there were three te pito o te henua, these being the three capes (land's ends) of the island. The phrase appears to have been used in the same sense as the designation of \"Land's End\" at the tip of Cornwall. He was unable to elicit a Polynesian name for the island and concluded that there may not have been one.[16]\n\nAccording to Barthel (1974), oral tradition has it that the island was first named Te pito o te kainga a Hau Maka, \"The little piece of land of Hau Maka\".[17] However, there are two words pronounced pito in Rapa Nui, one meaning 'end' and one 'navel', and the phrase can thus also mean \"The Navel of the World\". Another name, Mata ki te rangi, means \"Eyes looking to the sky\".[18]\n\nIslanders are referred to in Spanish as pascuense; however it is common to refer to members of the indigenous community as Rapa Nui.\n\nFelipe González de Ahedo named it Isla de San Carlos (\"Saint Charles' Island\", the patron saint of Charles III of Spain) or Isla de David (probably the phantom island of Davis Land; sometimes translated as \"Davis's Island\"[19]) in 1770.[20]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of Easter Island\nIntroduction\nOral tradition states the island was first settled by a two-canoe expedition, originating from Marae Renga (or Marae Toe Hau – otherwise known as Cook Islands), and led by the chief Hotu Matu'a and his captain Tu'u ko Iho. The island was first scouted after Haumaka dreamed of such a far-off country; Hotu deemed it a worthwhile place to flee from a neighboring chief, one to whom he had already lost three battles. At their time of arrival, the island had one lone settler, Nga Tavake 'a Te Rona. After a brief stay at Anakena, the colonists settled in different parts of the island. Hotu's heir, Tu'u ma Heke, was born on the island. Tu'u ko Iho is viewed as the leader who brought the statues and caused them to walk.[21]\n\nThe Easter Islanders are considered to be South-East Polynesians. Similar sacred zones with statuary (marae and ahu) in East Polynesia demonstrates homology with most of Eastern Polynesia. At contact, populations were about 3,000–4,000.[21]: 17–18, 20–21, 31, 41–45 \n\nBy the 15th century, two confederations, hanau, of social groupings, mata, existed, based on lineage. The western and northern portion of the island belonged to the Tu'u, which included the royal Miru, with the royal center at Anakena, though Tahai and Te Peu served as earlier capitals. The eastern portion of the island belonged to the 'Otu 'Itu. Shortly after the Dutch visit, from 1724 until 1750, the 'Otu 'Itu fought the Tu'u for control of the island. This fighting continued until the 1860s. Famine followed the burning of huts and the destruction of fields. Social control vanished as the ordered way of life gave way to lawlessness and predatory bands as the warrior class took over. Homelessness prevailed, with many living underground. After the Spanish visit, from 1770 onwards, a period of statue toppling, huri mo'ai, commenced. This was an attempt by competing groups to destroy the socio-spiritual power, or mana, represented by statues, making sure to break them in the fall to ensure they were dead and without power. None were left standing by the time of the arrival of the French missionaries in the 1860s.[21]: 21–24, 27, 54–56, 64–65 \n\nBetween 1862 and 1888, about 94% of the population perished or emigrated. The island was victimized by blackbirding from 1862 to 1863, resulting in the abduction or killing of about 1,500, with 1,408 working as indentured servants in Peru. Only about a dozen eventually returned to Easter Island, but they brought smallpox, which decimated the remaining population of 1,500. Those who perished included the island's tumu ivi 'atua, bearers of the island's culture, history, and genealogy besides the rongorongo experts.[21]: 86–91 \n\nRapa Nui settlement\n\nTraditional cultivars of sweet potato (kumara) were staple crops on Polynesian Rapa Nui\nEstimated dates of initial settlement of Easter Island have ranged from 300 to 1200 CE, though the current best estimate for colonization is in the 12th century CE. Easter Island colonization likely coincided with the arrival of the first settlers in Hawaii. Rectifications in radiocarbon dating have changed almost all of the previously posited early settlement dates in Polynesia. Ongoing archaeological studies provide this late date: \"Radiocarbon dates for the earliest stratigraphic layers at Anakena, Easter Island, and analysis of previous radiocarbon dates imply that the island was colonized late, about 1200 CE. Significant ecological impacts and major cultural investments in monumental architecture and statuary thus began soon after initial settlement.\"[22][23]\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the first settlement was at Anakena. Researchers have noted that the Caleta Anakena landing point provides the island's best shelter from prevailing swells as well as a sandy beach for canoe landings and launchings, so it is a likely early place of settlement. However radiocarbon dating concludes that other sites preceded Anakena by many years, especially the Tahai by several centuries.\n\nThe island was populated by Polynesians who most likely navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, 2,600 km (1,600 mi) away) or the Marquesas Islands, 3,200 km (2,000 mi) away. According to some theories, such as the Polynesian Diaspora Theory, there is a possibility that early Polynesian settlers arrived from South America due to their remarkable sea-navigation abilities. Theorists have supported this through the agricultural evidence of the sweet potato. The sweet potato was a favoured crop in Polynesian society for generations but it originated in South America, suggesting interaction between these two geographic areas.[24] However, recent research suggests that sweet potatoes may have spread to Polynesia by long-distance dispersal long before the Polynesians arrived.[25] When James Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, a Polynesian from Bora Bora, Hitihiti, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui.[26]: 296–297  The language most similar to Rapa Nui is Mangarevan, with an estimated 80% similar vocabulary. In 1999, a voyage with reconstructed Polynesian boats was able to reach Easter Island from Mangareva in 19 days.[27]\n\n\nA View of the Monuments of Easter Island, Rapanui, c. 1775–1776 by William Hodges.[28]\nAccording to oral traditions recorded by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a strong class system: an ariki, or high chief, wielded great power over nine other clans and their respective chiefs. The high chief was the eldest descendant through first-born lines of the island's legendary founder, Hotu Matu'a. The most visible element in the culture was the production of massive moai statues that some believe represented deified ancestors. According to National Geographic, \"Most scholars suspect that the moai were created to honor ancestors, chiefs, or other important personages, However, no written and little oral history exists on the island, so it's impossible to be certain.\"[29]\n\nIt was believed that the living had a symbiotic relationship with the dead in which the dead provided everything that the living needed (health, fertility of land and animals, fortune etc.) and the living, through offerings, provided the dead with a better place in the spirit world. Most settlements were located on the coast, and most moai were erected along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.\n\nIn his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, Jared Diamond suggested that cannibalism took place on Easter Island after the construction of the moai contributed to environmental degradation when extreme deforestation destabilized an already precarious ecosystem.[30] Archeological record shows that at the time of the initial settlement the island was home to many species of trees, including at least three species which grew up to 15 metres (49 ft) or more: Paschalococos (possibly the largest palm trees in the world at the time), Alphitonia zizyphoides, and Elaeocarpus rarotongensis. At least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. A major factor that contributed to the extinction of multiple plant species was the introduction of the Polynesian rat. Studies by paleobotanists have shown rats can dramatically affect the reproduction of vegetation in an ecosystem. In the case of Rapa Nui, recovered plant seed shells showed markings of being gnawed on by rats.[3] Barbara A. West wrote, \"Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island, the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island's ecology... By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island's population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.\"[31]\n\n\nRapa Nui people, painted by Louis Choris, 1816\nBy that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 m (9.8 ft). Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. One theory is that the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Rano Raraku.[32] Deforestation also caused erosion which caused a sharp decline in agricultural production.[3] This was exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a source of food. By the 18th century, islanders were largely sustained by farming, with domestic chickens as the primary source of protein.[33]\n\n\nMotu Nui islet, part of the Birdman Cult ceremony\nAs the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as matatoa gained more power and the Ancestor Cult ended, making way for the Bird Man Cult. Beverly Haun wrote, \"The concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period.\"[34] This cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a competition. The god responsible for creating humans, Makemake, played an important role in this process. Katherine Routledge, who systematically collected the island's traditions in her 1919 expedition,[35] showed that the competitions for Bird Man (Rapa Nui: tangata manu) started around 1760, after the arrival of the first Europeans, and ended in 1878, with the construction of the first church by Roman Catholic missionaries who formally arrived in 1864. Petroglyphs representing Bird Men on Easter Island are the same as some in Hawaii, indicating that this concept was probably brought by the original settlers; only the competition itself was unique to Easter Island.\n\nAccording to Diamond and Heyerdahl's version of the island's history, the huri mo'ai – \"statue-toppling\" – continued into the 1830s as a part of fierce internal wars. By 1838, the only standing moai were on the slopes of Rano Raraku, in Hoa Hakananai'a in Orongo, and Ariki Paro in Ahu Te Pito Kura. A study headed by Douglas Owsley published in 1994 asserted that there is little archaeological evidence of pre-European societal collapse. Bone pathology and osteometric data from islanders of that period clearly suggest few fatalities can be attributed directly to violence.[36] Research by Binghamton University anthropologists Robert DiNapoli and Carl Lipo in 2021 determined that the island experienced steady population growth from its initial settlement until European contact in 1722. The island never had more than a few thousand people prior to European contact, and their numbers were increasing rather than dwindling.[37][38]\n\nEuropean contact\n\nJacob Roggeveen analyzing a Moai statue, 18th-century engraving.\nThe first recorded European contact with the island was on 5 April 1722, Easter Sunday, by Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen.[26] His visit resulted in the death of about a dozen islanders, including the tumu ivi 'atua, and the wounding of many others.[21]: 46–53 \n\nThe next foreign visitors (on 15 November 1770) were two Spanish ships, San Lorenzo and Santa Rosalia, under the command of Captain Don Felipe Gonzalez de Ahedo.[26]: 238, 504  The Spanish were amazed by the \"standing idols\", all of which were erect at the time.[21]: 60–64 \n\nFour years later, in 1774, British explorer James Cook visited Easter Island; he reported that some statues had been toppled. Through the interpretation of Hitihiti, Cook learned the statues commemorated their former high chiefs, including their names and ranks.[26]: 296–297 \n\n\nLa Pérouse at Easter Island in 1786\nOn 10 April 1786, French Admiral Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse anchored at Hanga Roa at the start of a circumnavigation of the Pacific. He made a detailed map of the bay, including his anchorage points, as well as a more generalised map of the island, plus some illustrations.[39]\n\n19th century\nA series of devastating events killed or removed most of the population in the 1860s. In December 1862, Peruvian slave raiders struck. Violent abductions continued for several months, eventually capturing around 1,500 men and women, half of the island's population.[40] Among those captured were the island's paramount chief, his heir, and those who knew how to read and write the rongorongo script, the only Polynesian script to have been found to date, although debate exists about whether this is proto-writing or true writing.\n\nWhen the slave raiders were forced to repatriate the people they had kidnapped, carriers of smallpox disembarked together with a few survivors on each of the islands.[41] This created devastating epidemics from Easter Island to the Marquesas islands. Easter Island's population was reduced to the point where some of the dead were not even buried.[21]: 91 \n\nTuberculosis, introduced by whalers in the mid-19th century, had already killed several islanders when the first Christian missionary, Eugène Eyraud, died from this disease in 1867. It ultimately killed approximately a quarter of the island's population. In the following years, the managers of the sheep ranch and the missionaries started buying the newly available lands of the deceased, and this led to great confrontations between natives and settlers.\n\n\n\"Queen Mother\" Koreto with her daughters \"Queen\" Caroline and Harriette in 1877\nJean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier bought up all of the island apart from the missionaries' area around Hanga Roa and moved a few hundred Rapa Nui to Tahiti to work for his backers. In 1871 the missionaries, having fallen out with Dutrou-Bornier, evacuated all but 171 Rapa Nui to the Gambier islands.[42] Those who remained were mostly older men. Six years later, only 111 people lived on Easter Island, and only 36 of them had any offspring.[43] From that point on, the island's population slowly recovered. But with over 97% of the population dead or gone in less than a decade, much of the island's cultural knowledge had been lost.\n\nAlexander Salmon, Jr., a son of an English Jewish merchant and a Pōmare Dynasty prince, eventually worked to repatriate workers from his inherited copra plantation. He eventually bought up all lands on the island with the exception of the mission, and was its sole employer. He worked to develop tourism on the island and was the principal informant for the British and German archaeological expeditions for the island. He sent several pieces of genuine Rongorongo to his niece's husband, the German consul in Valparaíso, Chile. Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on 2 January 1888, and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December 1888. He effectively ruled the island from 1878 until his cession to Chile in 1888.\n\nEaster Island was annexed by Chile on 9 September 1888 by Policarpo Toro by means of the \"Treaty of Annexation of the Island\" (Tratado de Anexión de la isla). Toro, representing the government of Chile, signed with Atamu Tekena, designated \"King\" by the Roman Catholic missionaries after the paramount chief and his heir had died. The validity of this treaty is still contested by some Rapa Nui. Officially, Chile purchased the nearly all encompassing Mason-Brander sheep ranch, comprised from lands purchased from the descendants of Rapa Nui who died during the epidemics, and then claimed sovereignty over the island.\n\n20th century\n\nGeneral Pinochet posing with a young Rapa Nui woman\nUntil the 1960s, the surviving Rapa Nui were confined to Hanga Roa. The rest of the island was rented to the Williamson-Balfour Company as a sheep farm until 1953. This exemplified the introduction of private property into Rapa Nui.[44] The island was then managed by the Chilean Navy until 1966, at which point the island was reopened in its entirety. The Rapa Nui were given Chilean citizenship in 1966. [45]\n\nFollowing the 1973 Chilean coup d'état that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, Easter Island was placed under martial law. Tourism slowed, land was broken up, and private property was distributed to investors. During his time in power, Pinochet visited Easter Island on three occasions. The military built military facilities and a city hall.[46]\n\nAfter an agreement in 1985 between Chile and United States, the runway at Mataveri International Airport was enlarged and was inaugurated in 1987. The runway was expanded 423 m (1,388 ft), reaching 3,353 m (11,001 ft). Pinochet is reported to have refused to attend the inauguration in protest at pressures from the United States over human rights.[47]\n\n21st century\n\nManu Piri symbolizes love and union between two people. The slogan of the current administration is \"Rapa Nui hai mahatu\", translated as \"Rapa Nui with love\".\nFishers of Rapa Nui have shown their concern of illegal fishing on the island. \"Since the year 2000 we started to lose tuna, which is the basis of the fishing on the island, so then we began to take the fish from the shore to feed our families, but in less than two years we depleted all of it\", Pakarati said.[48] On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave Easter Island and the Juan Fernández Islands (also known as Robinson Crusoe Island) the status of \"special territories\" of Chile. Pending the enactment of a special charter, the island continues to be governed as a province of the V Region of Valparaíso.[49]\n\nSpecies of fish were collected in Easter Island for one month in different habitats including shallow lava pools and deep waters. Within these habitats, two holotypes and paratypes, Antennarius randalli and Antennarius moai, were discovered. These are considered frog-fish because of their characteristics: \"12 dorsal rays, last two or three branched; bony part of first dorsal spine slightly shorter than second dorsal spine; body without bold zebra-like markings; caudal peduncle short, but distinct; last pelvic ray divided; pectoral rays 11 or 12\".[50]\n\nIn 2018, the government decided to limit the stay period for tourists from 90 to 30 days because of social and environmental issues faced by the Island to preserve its historical importance.[51]\n\nA tsunami warning was declared for Easter Island after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.[52]\n\nIndigenous rights movement\n\nSouvenir Moai from Rapa Nui, bought at the Artisan's Market, 2020\nStarting in August 2010, members of the indigenous Hitorangi clan occupied the Hangaroa Eco Village and Spa.[53][54] The occupiers allege that the hotel was bought from the Pinochet government, in violation of a Chilean agreement with the indigenous Rapa Nui, in the 1990s.[55] The occupiers say their ancestors had been cheated into giving up the land.[56] According to a BBC report, on 3 December 2010, at least 25 people were injured when Chilean police using pellet guns attempted to evict from these buildings a group of Rapa Nui who had claimed that the land the buildings stood on had been illegally taken from their ancestors.[57]\n\nIn January 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous People, James Anaya, expressed concern about the treatment of the indigenous Rapa Nui by the Chilean government, urging Chile to \"make every effort to conduct a dialogue in good faith with representatives of the Rapa Nui people to solve, as soon as possible the real underlying problems that explain the current situation\".[53] The incident ended in February 2011, when up to 50 armed police broke into the hotel to remove the final five occupiers. They were arrested by the government, and no injuries were reported.[53]\n\nGeography\n\nEaster Island, Isla Salas y Gómez, South America and the islands in between\n\nDetailed map of Rapa Nui/Easter Island\nEaster Island is one of the world's most isolated inhabited islands.[58] Its closest inhabited neighbours are the Chilean Juan Fernandez Islands, 1,850 km (1,150 mi) to the east, with approximately 850 inhabitants.[citation needed] The nearest continental point lies in central Chile near Concepción, at 3,512 kilometres (2,182 mi). Easter Island's latitude is similar to that of Caldera, Chile, and it lies 3,510 km (2,180 mi) west of continental Chile at its nearest point (between Lota and Lebu in the Biobío Region). Isla Salas y Gómez, 415 km (258 mi) to the east, is closer but is uninhabited. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the southern Atlantic competes for the title of the most remote island, lying 2,430 km (1,510 mi) from Saint Helena island and 2,816 km (1,750 mi) from the South African coast.\n\nThe island is about 24.6 km (15.3 mi) long by 12.3 km (7.6 mi) at its widest point; its overall shape is triangular. It has an area of 163.6 km2 (63.2 sq mi), and a maximum elevation of 507 m (1,663 ft) above mean sea level. There are three Rano (freshwater crater lakes), at Rano Kau, Rano Raraku and Rano Aroi, near the summit of Terevaka, but no permanent streams or rivers.\n\nGeology\n\nTypical landscape on Easter Island; rounded extinct volcanoes covered in low vegetation.\nEaster Island is a volcanic high island, consisting mainly of three extinct coalesced volcanoes: Terevaka (altitude 507 metres) forms the bulk of the island, while two other volcanoes, Poike and Rano Kau, form the eastern and southern headlands and give the island its roughly triangular shape. Lesser cones and other volcanic features include the crater Rano Raraku, the cinder cone Puna Pau and many volcanic caves including lava tubes.[59] Poike used to be a separate island until volcanic material from Terevaka united it to the larger whole. The island is dominated by hawaiite and basalt flows which are rich in iron and show affinity with igneous rocks found in the Galápagos Islands.[60]\n\nEaster Island and surrounding islets, such as Motu Nui and Motu Iti, form the summit of a large volcanic mountain rising over 2,000 m (6,600 ft) from the sea bed. The mountain is part of the Salas y Gómez Ridge, a (mostly submarine) mountain range with dozens of seamounts, formed by the Easter hotspot. The range begins with Pukao and next Moai, two seamounts to the west of Easter Island, and extends 2,700 km (1,700 mi) east to the Nazca Ridge. The ridge was formed by the Nazca Plate moving over the Easter hotspot.[61]\n\nLocated about 350 km (220 mi) east of the East Pacific Rise, Easter Island lies within the Nazca Plate, bordering the Easter Microplate. The Nazca-Pacific relative plate movement due to the seafloor spreading, amounts to about 150 mm (5.9 in) per year. This movement over the Easter hotspot has resulted in the Easter Seamount Chain, which merges into the Nazca Ridge further to the east. Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez are surface representations of that chain. The chain has progressively younger ages to the west. The current hotspot location is speculated to be west of Easter Island, amidst the Ahu, Umu and Tupa submarine volcanic fields and the Pukao and Moai seamounts.[62]\n\nEaster Island lies atop the Rano Kau Ridge, and consists of three shield volcanoes with parallel geologic histories. Poike and Rano Kau exist on the east and south slopes of Terevaka, respectively. Rano Kau developed between 0.78 and 0.46 Ma from tholeiitic to alkalic basalts. This volcano possesses a clearly defined summit caldera. Benmoreitic lavas extruded about the rim from 0.35 to 0.34 Ma. Finally, between 0.24 and 0.11 Ma, a 6.5 km (4.0 mi) fissure developed along a NE–SW trend, forming monogenetic vents and rhyolitic intrusions. These include the cryptodome islets of Motu Nui and Motu Iti, the islet of Motu Kao Kao, the sheet intrusion of Te Kari Kari, the perlitic obsidian Te Manavai dome and the Maunga Orito dome.[62]\n\nPoike formed from tholeiitic to alkali basalts from 0.78 to 0.41 Ma. Its summit collapsed into a caldera which was subsequently filled by the Puakatiki lava cone pahoehoe flows at 0.36 Ma. Finally, the trachytic lava domes of Maunga Vai a Heva, Maunga Tea Tea, and Maunga Parehe formed along a NE-SW trending fissure.[62]\n\nTerevaka formed around 0.77 Ma of tholeiitic to alkali basalts, followed by the collapse of its summit into a caldera. Then at about 0.3Ma, cinder cones formed along a NNE-SSW trend on the western rim, while porphyritic benmoreitic lava filled the caldera, and pahoehoe flowed towards the northern coast, forming lava tubes, and to the southeast. Lava domes and a vent complex formed in the Maunga Puka area, while breccias formed along the vents on the western portion of Rano Aroi crater. This volcano's southern and southeastern flanks are composed of younger flows consisting of basalt, alkali basalt, hawaiite, mugearite, and benmoreite from eruptive fissures starting at 0.24 Ma. The youngest lava flow, Roiho, is dated at 0.11 Ma. The Hanga O Teo embayment is interpreted to be a 200 m high landslide scarp.[62]\n\nRano Raraku and Maunga Toa Toa are isolated tuff cones of about 0.21 Ma. The crater of Rano Raraku contains a freshwater lake. The stratified tuff is composed of sideromelane, slightly altered to palagonite, and somewhat lithified. The tuff contains lithic fragments of older lava flows. The northwest sector of Rano Raraku contains reddish volcanic ash.[62] According to Bandy, \"...all of the great images of Easter Island are carved from\" the light and porous tuff from Rano Raraku. A carving was abandoned when a large, dense and hard lithic fragment was encountered. However, these lithics became the basis for stone hammers and chisels. The Puna Pau crater contains an extremely porous pumice, from which was carved the Pukao \"hats\". The Maunga Orito obsidian was used to make the \"mataa\" spearheads.[63]\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, steam reportedly came out of the Rano Kau crater wall. This was photographed by the island's manager, Mr. Edmunds.[64]\n\nClimate\nSee also: Climate of Chile\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, the climate of Easter Island is classified as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) that borders on a tropical rainforest climate (Af). The lowest temperatures are recorded in July and August (minimum 15 °C or 59 °F) and the highest in February (maximum temperature 28 °C or 82.4 °F[65]), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are relatively mild. The rainiest month is May, though the island experiences year-round rainfall.[66] Easter Island's isolated location exposes it to winds which help to keep the temperature fairly cool. Precipitation averages 1,118 millimetres or 44 inches per year. Occasionally, heavy rainfall and rainstorms strike the island. These occur mostly in the winter months (June–August). Since it is close to the South Pacific High and outside the range of the intertropical convergence zone, cyclones and hurricanes do not occur around Easter Island.[67] There is significant temperature moderation due to its isolated position in the middle of the ocean.\n\nClimate data for Easter Island (Mataveri International Airport) 1981–2010, extremes 1912–1990\nMonth\tJan\tFeb\tMar\tApr\tMay\tJun\tJul\tAug\tSep\tOct\tNov\tDec\tYear\nRecord high °C (°F)\t32.0\n(89.6)\t31.0\n(87.8)\t32.0\n(89.6)\t31.0\n(87.8)\t30.0\n(86.0)\t29.0\n(84.2)\t31.0\n(87.8)\t28.3\n(82.9)\t30.0\n(86.0)\t29.0\n(84.2)\t33.0\n(91.4)\t34.0\n(93.2)\t34.0\n(93.2)\nAverage high °C (°F)\t26.9\n(80.4)\t27.4\n(81.3)\t26.8\n(80.2)\t25.3\n(77.5)\t23.3\n(73.9)\t21.9\n(71.4)\t21.0\n(69.8)\t21.0\n(69.8)\t21.5\n(70.7)\t22.4\n(72.3)\t23.8\n(74.8)\t25.4\n(77.7)\t23.9\n(75.0)\nDaily mean °C (°F)\t23.3\n(73.9)\t23.7\n(74.7)\t23.1\n(73.6)\t21.9\n(71.4)\t20.1\n(68.2)\t18.9\n(66.0)\t18.0\n(64.4)\t17.9\n(64.2)\t18.3\n(64.9)\t19.0\n(66.2)\t20.4\n(68.7)\t21.8\n(71.2)\t20.5\n(68.9)\nAverage low °C (°F)\t20.0\n(68.0)\t20.6\n(69.1)\t20.3\n(68.5)\t19.3\n(66.7)\t17.8\n(64.0)\t16.8\n(62.2)\t15.9\n(60.6)\t15.6\n(60.1)\t15.8\n(60.4)\t16.2\n(61.2)\t17.4\n(63.3)\t18.7\n(65.7)\t17.9\n(64.2)\nRecord low °C (°F)\t12.0\n(53.6)\t14.0\n(57.2)\t11.0\n(51.8)\t12.7\n(54.9)\t10.0\n(50.0)\t7.0\n(44.6)\t9.4\n(48.9)\t7.0\n(44.6)\t8.0\n(46.4)\t8.0\n(46.4)\t8.0\n(46.4)\t12.0\n(53.6)\t7.0\n(44.6)\nAverage rainfall mm (inches)\t70.4\n(2.77)\t80.2\n(3.16)\t99.2\n(3.91)\t139.9\n(5.51)\t143.4\n(5.65)\t110.3\n(4.34)\t130.1\n(5.12)\t104.8\n(4.13)\t108.5\n(4.27)\t90.6\n(3.57)\t75.4\n(2.97)\t75.6\n(2.98)\t1,228.1\n(48.35)\nAverage rainy days (≥ 1.0 mm)\t9.3\t10.1\t10.8\t12.1\t12.6\t11.5\t12.1\t10.7\t10.0\t8.4\t9.2\t9.2\t126.0\nAverage relative humidity (%)\t77\t79\t79\t81\t81\t81\t80\t80\t79\t77\t77\t78\t79\nMean monthly sunshine hours\t274\t239\t229\t193\t173\t145\t156\t172\t179\t213\t222\t242\t2,437\nSource 1: Dirección Meteorológica de Chile[68]\nSource 2: World Meteorological Organization (precipitation days 1981–2010),[69] Ogimet (sun 1981–2010)[70] Deutscher Wetterdienst (extremes and humidity)[71]\nEcology\nEaster Island, together with its closest neighbour, the tiny island of Isla Salas y Gómez 415 km (258 mi) farther east, is recognized by ecologists as a distinct ecoregion, the Rapa Nui subtropical broadleaf forests. The original subtropical moist broadleaf forests are now gone, but paleobotanical studies of fossil pollen, tree moulds left by lava flows, and root casts found in local soils indicate that the island was formerly forested, with a range of trees, shrubs, ferns, and grasses. A large extinct palm, Paschalococos disperta, related to the Chilean wine palm (Jubaea chilensis), was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence. Like its Chilean counterpart it probably took close to 100 years to reach adult height. The Polynesian rat, which the original settlers brought with them, played a very important role in the disappearance of the Rapa Nui palm. Although some may believe that rats played a major role in the degradation of the forest, less than 10% of palm nuts show teeth marks from rats. The remains of palm stumps in different places indicate that humans caused the trees to fall because in large areas, the stumps were cut efficiently.[72] In 2018, a New York Times article announced that Easter Island is eroding.[73]\n\nThe clearance of the palms to make the settlements led to their extinction almost 350 years ago.[74] The toromiro tree (Sophora toromiro) was prehistorically present on Easter Island, but is now extinct in the wild. However, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Göteborg Botanical Garden are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island. With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone, there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation. After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century, by the mid-1900s the island was mostly covered in grassland with nga'atu or bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus tatora) in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau. The presence of these reeds, which are called totora in the Andes, was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders, but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30,000 years.[citation needed] Before the arrival of humans, Easter Island had vast seabird colonies containing probably over 30 resident species, perhaps the world's richest.[75] Such colonies are no longer found on the main island. Fossil evidence indicates six species of land birds (two rails, two parrots, one owl, and one heron), all of which have become extinct.[76] Five introduced species of land bird are known to have breeding populations (see List of birds of Easter Island).\n\nLack of studies results in poor understanding of the oceanic fauna of Easter Island and waters in its vicinity; however, possibilities of undiscovered breeding grounds for humpback, southern blue and pygmy blue whales including Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez have been considered.[77] Potential breeding areas for fin whales have been detected off northeast of the island as well.[78]\n\nVegetation on the island\nSatellite view of Easter Island 2019.

The drug is also known as rapamycin, after Rapa Nui.[79] It is now being studied for extending longevity in mice.[80]\n\nTrees are sparse, rarely forming natural groves, and it has been argued whether native Easter Islanders deforested the island in the process of erecting their statues,[81] and in providing sustenance for an overconsumption of natural resources from a overcrowded island.[citation needed] Experimental archaeology demonstrated that some statues certainly could have been placed on \"Y\" shaped wooden frames called miro manga erua and then pulled to their final destinations on ceremonial sites.[81] Other theories involve the use of \"ladders\" (parallel wooden rails) over which the statues could have been dragged.[82] Rapa Nui traditions metaphorically refer to spiritual power (mana) as the means by which the moai were \"walked\" from the quarry. Recent experimental recreations have proven that it is fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by use of ropes, casting doubt on the role that their existence plays in the environmental collapse of the island.[83]\n\nGiven the island's southern latitude, the climatic effects of the Little Ice Age (about 1650 to 1850) may have exacerbated deforestation, although this remains speculative.[81] Many researchers[84] point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree's disappearance. Experts, however, do not agree on when the island's palms became extinct.\n\nJared Diamond dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island's deforestation in his book Collapse which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders.[85] Influenced by Heyerdahl's romantic interpretation of Easter's history, Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries. He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu. But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers, whalers, sandalwood traders, and slave raiders.\n\nMidden contents show that the main source of protein was tuna and dolphin. With the loss of the trees, there was a sudden drop in the quantities of fish bones found in middens as the islanders lost the means to construct fishing vessels, coinciding with a large increase in bird bones. This was followed by a decrease in the number of bird bones as birds lost their nesting sites or became extinct. A new style of art from this period shows people with exposed ribs and distended bellies, indicative of malnutrition, and it is around this time that many islanders moved to live in fortified caves, and the first signs of warfare and cannibalism appear.\n\nSoil erosion because of lack of trees is apparent in some places. Sediment samples document that up to half of the native plants had become extinct and that the vegetation of the island drastically altered. Polynesians were primarily farmers, not fishermen, and their diet consisted mainly of cultivated staples such as taro root, sweet potato, yams, cassava, and bananas. With no trees to protect them, sea spray led to crop failures exacerbated by a sudden reduction in freshwater flows. There is evidence that the islanders took to planting crops in caves beneath collapsed ceilings and covered the soil with rocks to reduce evaporation. Cannibalism occurred on many Polynesian islands, sometimes in times of plenty as well as famine. Its presence on Easter Island (based on human remains associated with cooking sites, especially in caves) is supported by oral histories.[citation needed]\n\nBenny Peiser[5] noted evidence of self-sufficiency when Europeans first arrived. The island still had smaller trees, mainly toromiro, which became extinct in the wild in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island's ecosystem. Cornelis Bouman, Jakob Roggeveen's captain, stated in his logbook, \"... of yams, bananas and small coconut palms we saw little and no other trees or crops.\" According to Carl Friedrich Behrens, Roggeveen's officer, \"The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings.\" According to ethnographer Alfred Mètraux, the most common type of house was called \"hare paenga\" (and is known today as \"boathouse\") because the roof resembled an overturned boat. The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house. These were then covered with a layer of totora reed, followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves, and lastly a layer of woven grass.\n\nPeiser claims that these reports indicate that large trees existed at that time, which is perhaps contradicted by the Bouman quote above. Plantations were often located farther inland, next to foothills, inside open-ceiling lava tubes, and in other places protected from the strong salt winds and salt spray affecting areas closer to the coast. It is possible many of the Europeans did not venture inland. The statue quarry, only one kilometre (5⁄8 mile) from the coast with an impressive cliff 100 m (330 ft) high, was not explored by Europeans until well into the 19th century.\n\n\nPanorama of Anakena beach, Easter Island. The moai pictured here was the first to be raised back into place on its ahu in 1955 by Thor Heyerdahl[86] using the labor of islanders and wooden levers.\nEaster Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries, perhaps aggravated by agriculture and massive deforestation. This process seems to have been gradual and may have been aggravated by sheep farming throughout most of the 20th century. Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile. \"Fowls are the only animals they keep. They cultivate bananas, sugar cane, and above all sweet potatoes.\" In 1786 Jean-François de La Pérouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that \"three days' work a year\" would be enough to support the population. Rollin, a major in the Pérouse expedition, wrote, \"Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine... I found, on the contrary, a considerable population, with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island; and a soil, which, with very little labor, furnished excellent provisions, and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.\"[87]\n\nAccording to Diamond, the oral traditions (the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge, Lavachery, Mètraux, Peiser, and others) of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism, which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse. For example, he states, to severely insult an enemy one would say, \"The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth.\" This, Diamond asserts, means the food supply of the people ultimately ran out.[88] Cannibalism, however, was widespread across Polynesian cultures.[89] Human bones have not been found in earth ovens other than those behind the religious platforms, indicating that cannibalism in Easter Island was a ritualistic practice. Contemporary ethnographic research has proven there is scarcely any tangible evidence for widespread cannibalism anywhere and at any time on the island.[90] The first scientific exploration of Easter Island (1914) recorded that the indigenous population strongly rejected allegations that they or their ancestors had been cannibals.[35]\n\nCulture\n\nBird paintings in the cave called \"Cave of the Men Eaters\"\nMythology\nMain article: Rapa Nui mythology\nThe most important myths are:[citation needed]\n\nTangata manu, the Birdman cult which was practised until the 1860s.\nMakemake, an important god.\nAku-aku, the guardians of the sacred family caves.\nMoai-kava-kava a ghost man of the Hanau epe (long-ears.)\nHekai ite umu pare haonga takapu Hanau epe kai noruego, the sacred chant to appease the aku-aku before entering a family cave.\nStone work\nThe Rapa Nui people had a Stone Age culture and made extensive use of local stone:\n\nBasalt, a hard, dense stone used for toki and at least one of the moai.\nObsidian, a volcanic glass with sharp edges used for sharp-edged implements such as Mataa and for the black pupils of the eyes of the moai.\nRed scoria from Puna Pau, a very light red stone used for the pukao and a few moai.\nTuff from Rano Raraku, a much more easily worked rock than basalt that was used for most of the moai.\nStatues\nThe large stone statues, or moai, for which Easter Island is famous, were carved in the period 1100–1680 CE (rectified radio-carbon dates).[18] A total of 887 monolithic stone statues have been inventoried on the island and in museum collections.[91] Although often identified as \"Easter Island heads\", the statues have torsos, most of them ending at the top of the thighs; a small number are complete figures that kneel on bent knees with their hands over their stomachs.[92][93] Some upright moai have become buried up to their necks by shifting soils.\n\nAlmost all (95%)[citation needed] moai were carved from compressed, easily worked solidified volcanic ash or tuff, found at a single site on the side of the extinct volcano Rano Raraku. The native islanders who carved them used only stone hand chisels, mainly basalt toki, which lie in place all over the quarry. The stone chisels were sharpened by chipping off a new edge when dulled. While sculpting was going on, the volcanic stone was splashed with water to soften it. While many teams worked on different statues at the same time, a single moai took a team of five or six men approximately a year to complete. Each statue represented the deceased head of a lineage.[citation needed]\n\nOnly a quarter of the statues were installed. Nearly half remained in the quarry at Rano Raraku, and the rest sat elsewhere, presumably on their way to intended locations. The largest moai raised on a platform is known as \"Paro\". It weighs 82 tonnes (90 short tons) and is 9.89 m (32 ft 5 in) long.[94][95] Several other statues of similar weight were transported to ahu on the north and south coasts.\n\nPossible means by which the statues were moved include employment of a miro manga erua, a Y-shaped sledge with cross pieces, pulled with ropes made from the tough bark of the hau tree[96] and tied around the statue's neck. Anywhere from 180 to 250 men were required for pulling, depending on the size of the moai. Among other researchers on moving and erecting the moai was Vince Lee, who reenacted a moai moving scenario. Some 50 of the statues were re-erected in modern times. One of the first was on Ahu Ature Huke in Anakena beach in 1956.[97] It was raised using traditional methods during a Heyerdahl expedition.\n\nAnother method that might have been used to transport the moai would be to attach ropes to the statue and rock it, tugging it forward as it rocked. This would fit the legend of the Mo'ai 'walking' to their final locations.[98][99][100] This might have been managed by as few as 15 people, supported by the following evidence:\n\nThe heads of the moai in the quarry are sloped forward, whereas the ones moved to final locations are not. This would serve to provide a better centre of gravity for transport.\nThe statues found along the transport roads have wider bases than statues installed on ahu; this would facilitate more stable transport. Studies have shown fractures along the bases of the statues in transport; these could have arisen from rocking the statue back and forth and placing great pressures on the edges. The statues found mounted on ahu do not have wide bases, and stone chips found at the sites suggest they were further modified on placement.\nThe abandoned and fallen statues near the old roads are found (more often than would be expected from chance) face down on ascending grades and on their backs when headed uphill. Some were documented standing upright along the old roads, e.g., by a party from Captain Cook's voyage that rested in the shade of a standing statue. This would be consistent with upright transport.\nThere is debate regarding the effects of the monument creation process on the environment. Some believe that the process of creating the moai caused widespread deforestation and ultimately a civil war over scarce resources.[101]\n\nIn 2011, a large moai statue was excavated from the ground.[102] During the same excavation program, some larger moai were found to have complex dorsal petroglyphs, revealed by deep excavation of the torso.[103]\n\nIn 2020, a pickup truck crashed into and destroyed a moai statue due to brake failure. No one was injured in the incident.[104][105]\n\nMoais\nTukuturi, an unusual bearded kneeling moai\nTukuturi, an unusual bearded kneeling moai\n\n \nAll fifteen standing moai at Ahu Tongariki, excavated and restored in the 1990s\nAll fifteen standing moai at Ahu Tongariki, excavated and restored in the 1990s\n\n \nAhu Akivi, one of the few inland ahu, with the only moai facing the ocean\nAhu Akivi, one of the few inland ahu, with the only moai facing the ocean\n\n\nStone platforms\n\nTwo ahu at Hanga Roa. In foreground Ahu Ko Te Riku (with a pukao on its head). In the mid-ground is a side view of an ahu with five moai showing retaining wall, platform, ramp and pavement. The Mataveri end of Hanga Roa is visible in the background with Rano Kau rising above it.\nAhu are stone platforms. Varying greatly in layout, many were reworked during or after the huri mo'ai or statue-toppling era; many became ossuaries, one was dynamited open, and Ahu Tongariki was swept inland by a tsunami. Of the 313 known ahu, 125 carried moai – usually just one, probably because of the shortness of the moai period and transportation difficulties. Ahu Tongariki, one km (0.62 mi) from Rano Raraku, had the most and tallest moai, 15 in total.[106] Other notable ahu with moai are Ahu Akivi, restored in 1960 by William Mulloy, Nau Nau at Anakena and Tahai. Some moai may have been made from wood and were lost.\n\nThe classic elements of ahu design are:\n\nA retaining rear wall several feet high, usually facing the sea\nA front wall made of rectangular basalt slabs called paenga\nA fascia made of red scoria that went over the front wall (platforms built after 1300)\nA sloping ramp in the inland part of the platform, extending outward like wings\nA pavement of even-sized, round water-worn stones called poro\nAn alignment of stones before the ramp\nA paved plaza before the ahu. This was called marae\nInside the ahu was a fill of rubble.\nOn top of many ahu would have been:\n\nMoai on squarish \"pedestals\" looking inland, the ramp with the poro before them.\nPukao or Hau Hiti Rau on the moai heads (platforms built after 1300).\nWhen a ceremony took place, \"eyes\" were placed on the statues. The whites of the eyes were made of coral, the iris was made of obsidian or red scoria.\nAhu evolved from the traditional Polynesian marae. In this context, ahu referred to a small structure sometimes covered with a thatched roof where sacred objects, including statues, were stored. The ahu were usually adjacent to the marae or main central court where ceremonies took place, though on Easter Island, ahu and moai evolved to much greater size. There the marae is the unpaved plaza before the ahu. The biggest ahu is 220 m (720 ft) and holds 15 statues, some of which are 9 m (30 ft) high. The filling of an ahu was sourced locally (apart from broken, old moai, fragments of which have been used in the fill).[86] Individual stones are mostly far smaller than the moai, so less work was needed to transport the raw material, but artificially leveling the terrain for the plaza and filling the ahu was laborious.\n\nAhu are found mostly on the coast, where they are distributed fairly evenly, except on the western slopes of Mount Terevaka and the Rano Kau and Poike[107] headlands. These are the three areas with the least low-lying coastal land and, apart from Poike, the furthest areas from Rano Raraku. One ahu with several moai was recorded on the cliffs at Rano Kau in the 1880s but had fallen to the beach before the Routledge expedition.[35]\n\n\nA Hare Moa, a Chicken House, image cut from a laser scan collected by nonprofit CyArk.\nStone walls\nOne of the highest-quality examples of Easter Island stone masonry is the rear wall of the ahu at Vinapu. Made without mortar by shaping hard basalt rocks of up to 7,000 kg (6.9 long tons; 7.7 short tons) to match each other exactly, it has a superficial similarity to some Inca stone walls in South America.[108]\n\nStone houses\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nTwo types of houses are known from the past: hare paenga, a house with an elliptical foundation, made with basalt slabs and covered with a thatched roof that resembled an overturned boat, and hare oka, a round stone structure. Related stone structures called Tupa look very similar to the hare oka, except that the Tupa were inhabited by astronomer-priests and located near the coast, where the movements of the stars could be easily observed. Settlements also contain hare moa (\"chicken house\"), oblong stone structures that housed chickens. The houses at the ceremonial village of Orongo are unique in that they are shaped like hare paenga but are made entirely of flat basalt slabs found inside Rano Kao crater. The entrances to all the houses are very low, and entry requires crawling.\n\nIn early times the people of Rapa Nui reportedly sent the dead out to sea in small funerary canoes, as did their Polynesian counterparts on other islands. They later started burying people in secret caves to save the bones from desecration by enemies. During the turmoil of the late 18th century, the islanders seem to have started to bury their dead in the space between the belly of a fallen moai and the front wall of the structure. During the time of the epidemics they made mass graves that were semi-pyramidal stone structures.\n\nPetroglyphs\nEaster Island has one of the richest collections of petroglyphs in all Polynesia. Around 1,000 sites with more than 4,000 petroglyphs are catalogued. Designs and images were carved out of rock for a variety of reasons: to create totems, to mark territory, or to memorialize a person or event. There are distinct variations around the island in the frequency of themes among petroglyphs, with a concentration of Birdmen at Orongo. Other subjects include sea turtles, Komari (vulvas) and Makemake, the chief god of the Tangata manu or Birdman cult.[109]\n\nPetroglyphs\nMakemake with two birdmen, carved from red scoria\nMakemake with two birdmen, carved from red scoria\n\n \nFish petroglyph found near Ahu Tongariki\nFish petroglyph found near Ahu Tongariki\n\nCaves\nThe island[110] and neighbouring Motu Nui are riddled with caves, many of which show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications, including narrowed entrances and crawl spaces with ambush points. Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui.[111]\n\nOther stones\nThe Pu o Hiro or Hiro's Trumpet is a stone on the north coast of Easter Island. It was once a musical instrument used in fertility rituals.[112][113][114]\n\n\nSample of rongorongo\nRongorongo\nMain article: Rongorongo\nEaster Island once had an apparent script called rongorongo. Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; the texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène Eyraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders said they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dozen texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities with the petroglyphs on the island.[115]\n\nWood carving\nSkeletal easter island statue.JPG\tFat wooden Moai.JPG\nSkeletal statuette\tAtypical portly statuette\nWood was scarce on Easter Island during the 18th and 19th centuries, but a number of highly detailed and distinctive carvings have found their way to the world's museums. Particular forms include:[116]\n\n\nAncestor figure, circa 1830, from LACMA collections\nReimiro, a gorget or breast ornament of crescent shape with a head at one or both tips.[117] The same design appears on the flag of Rapa Nui. Two Rei Miru at the British Museum are inscribed with Rongorongo.\nMoko Miro, a man with a lizard head. The Moko Miro was used as a club because of the legs, which formed a handle shape. If it wasn't held by hand, dancers wore it around their necks during feasts. The Moko Miro would also be placed at the doorway to protect the household from harm. It would be hanging from the roof or set in the ground. The original form had eyes made from white shells, and the pupils were made of obsidian.[118]\nMoai kavakava are male carvings and the Moai Paepae are female carvings.[119] These grotesque and highly detailed human figures carved from Toromiro pine, represent ancestors. Sometimes these statues were used for fertility rites. Usually, they are used for harvest celebrations; \"the first picking of fruits was heaped around them as offerings\". When the statues were not used, they would be wrapped in bark cloth and kept at home. There were a few times that are reported when the islanders would pick up the figures like dolls and dance with them.[119] The earlier figures are rare and generally depict a male figure with an emaciated body and a goatee. The figures' ribs and vertebrae are exposed and many examples show carved glyphs on various parts of the body but more specifically, on the top of the head. The female figures, rarer than the males, depict the body as flat and often with the female's hand lying across the body. The figures, although some were quite large, were worn as ornamental pieces around a tribesman's neck. The more figures worn, the more important the man. The figures have a shiny patina developed from constant handling and contact with human skin.[citation needed]\nAo, a large dancing paddle\n21st-century culture\nThe Rapanui sponsor an annual festival, the Tapati, held since 1975 around the beginning of February to celebrate Rapa Nui culture. The islanders also maintain a national football team and three discos in the town of Hanga Roa. Other cultural activities include a musical tradition that combines South American and Polynesian influences and woodcarving.\n\nSports\nThe Chilean leg of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series takes place on the Island of Rapa Nui.\n\nTapati Festival\nTapati Rapa Nui festival (\"week festival\" in the local language) is an annual two-week long festival celebrating Easter Island culture.[120] The Tapati is centered around a competition between two families/ clans competing in various competitions to earn points. The winning team has their candidate crowned 'queen' of the island for the next year. The competitions are a way to maintain and celebrate traditional cultural activities such as cooking, jewelry-making, woodcarving, and canoeing.[121]\n\nDemographics\nFurther information: Europeans in Oceania\n2012 census\nPopulation at the 2012 census was 5,761 (increased from 3,791 in 2002).[122] In 2002, 60% were persons of indigenous Rapa Nui origin, 39% were mainland Chileans (or their Easter Island-born descendants) of European (mostly Spanish) or mestizo (mixed European and indigenous Chilean Amerindian) origin and Easter Island-born mestizos of European and Rapa Nui and/or native Chilean descent, and the remaining 1% were indigenous mainland Chilean Amerindians (or their Easter Island-born descendants).[123] As of 2012, the population density on Easter Island was 35/km2 (91/sq mi).\n\nDemographic history\nThe 1982 population was 1,936. The increase in population in the last census was partly caused by the arrival of people of European or mixed European and Native American descent from the Chilean mainland. However, most married a Rapa Nui spouse. Around 70% of the population were natives. Estimates of the pre-European population range from 7–17,000. Easter Island's all-time low of 111 inhabitants was reported in 1877. Out of these 111 Rapa Nui, only 36 had descendants, and all of today's Rapa Nui claim descent from those 36.\n\nLanguages\nEaster Island's traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language, sharing some similarities with Hawaiian and Tahitian. However, as in the rest of mainland Chile, the official language used is Spanish.\n\nIt is supposed[124] that the 2,700 indigenous Rapa Nui living in the island have a certain degree of knowledge of their traditional language; however, census data does not exist on the primary known and spoken languages among Easter Island's inhabitants and there are recent claims that the number of fluent speakers is as low as 800.[125] Indeed, Rapa Nui has been declining in its number of speakers as the island undergoes Hispanicization, because the island is under the jurisdiction of Chile and is now home to a number of Chilean continentals, most of whom speak only Spanish. For this reason, most Rapa Nui children now grow up speaking Spanish, and those who do learn Rapa Nui begin learning it later in life.[126] Even with efforts to revitalize the language,[127] Ethnologue has established that Rapa Nui is currently a threatened language.[124]\n\nEaster Island's indigenous Rapa Nui toponymy has survived with few Spanish additions or replacements, a fact that has been attributed in part to the survival of the Rapa Nui language.[128]\n\nAdministration and legal status\nMain articles: Isla de Pascua (commune) and Isla de Pascua Province\nEaster Island shares with Juan Fernández Islands the constitutional status of \"special territory\" of Chile, granted in 2007. As of 2011 a special charter for the island was under discussion in the Chilean Congress.\n\nAdministratively, the island is a province (Isla de Pascua Province) of the Valparaíso Region and contains a single commune (comuna) (Isla de Pascua). Both the province and the commune are called Isla de Pascua and encompass the whole island and its surrounding islets and rocks, plus Isla Salas y Gómez, some 380 km (240 mi) to the east. The provincial governor is appointed by the President of the Republic.[129] The municipal administration is located in Hanga Roa, led by a mayor and a six-member municipal council, all directly elected for a four-year mandate.\n\nIn August 2018, a law took effect prohibiting non-residents from staying on the island for more than 30 days.[130]\n\nSince 1966 rape, sexual abuse and crimes against property in Easter Island have lower sentences than corresponding offences in mainland Chile.[131]\n\nNotable people\n\nAngata, 1919\n\nThor Heyerdahl, 1980\n\nMahani Teave, 2012\nLaura Alarcón Rapu, governor (since 2018)\nTiare Aguilera Hey, member of the Chilean Constitutional Convention (since 2021)\nFelipe González de Ahedo (1714–1802), a Spanish navigator and cartographer; annexed Easter Island in 1770.\nAngata (ca.1853–1914), native catechist and prophetess who led a 1914 rebellion\nThomas Barthel (1923–1997) a German ethnologist and epigrapher\nCarmen Cardinali (born 1944) a Rapa Nui Chilean professor, governor of Easter Island, 2010-2014.\nJean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier (1834–1876) a French mariner, removed many of the Rapa Nui people and turned the island into a sheep ranch.\nSebastian Englert (1888–1969), missionary and ethnologist\nEugène Eyraud (1820–1868), missionary\nThor Heyerdahl (1914–2002), a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer\nMelania Hotu (born 1959), governor (2006–2010, 2015–2018)\nMarta Hotus Tuki (born 1969), governor (2014–2015)\nRiro Kāinga (died 1898 or 1899), last person to hold title of king and rule before Chilean consolidation\nKings of Easter Island\nHotu Matuꞌa, island founder\nWilliam Mulloy (1917–1978), an American anthropologist and archaeologist\nNga'ara (died 1859), one of the last ‘ariki\nJacobo Hey Paoa, first Rapa Nui male to earn a law degree and become an attorney\nPedro Edmunds Paoa (born 1961), mayor and former governor\nJuan Edmunds Rapahango (1923–2012), former mayor\nHippolyte Roussel (1824–1898), a French priest and missionary\nKatherine Routledge (1866–1935), an English archaeologist and anthropologist\nAlexander Ariʻipaea Salmon (1855–1914) English-Jewish-Tahitian de facto ruler of Easter Island, 1878-1888.\nMahani Teave (born 1983), a Chilean American classical pianist\nAtamu Tekena (ca.1850–1892), missionary installed King who ceded island to Chile\nJosé Fati Tepano, first Rapa Nui male to serve as a titular judge upon completing training in Chile\nJuan Tepano (1867–1947), indigenous leader and cultural informant\nValentino Riroroko Tuki (1932—2017) last claimant to the Rapa Nui throne\nLynn Rapu Tuki (born 1969), head-teacher, promotes the arts and traditions of the Rapa Nui People.\nLuz Zasso Paoa a Rapa Nui politician, Mayor of Easter Island, 2008-2012.\nTransportation\nEaster Island is served by Mataveri International Airport, with jet service (currently Boeing 787s) from LATAM Chile and, seasonally, subsidiaries such as LATAM Perú.\n\nGallery\nHanga Roa town hall\nHanga Roa town hall\n\n \nPolynesian dancing with feather costumes is on the tourist itinerary.\nPolynesian dancing with feather costumes is on the tourist itinerary.\n\n \nFishing boats\nFishing boats\n\n \nFront view of the Catholic Church, Hanga Roa\nFront view of the Catholic Church, Hanga Roa\n\n \nCatholic Church, Hanga Roa\nCatholic Church, Hanga Roa\n\n \nInterior view of the Catholic Church in Hanga Roa\nInterior view of the Catholic Church in Hanga Roa\n\nSee also\nList of largest monoliths\nLists of islands\nNorth Sentinel Island\nOmphalos\nPodesta\nReferences\n \"Censo 2017\"\n.

It was warm but tolerable, a typical day in November. Very hot but excellent for the body. His physician would have been pleased with his physical condition. If he were there, at least. But doctors were far from his mind. He was desperate. Desperate to find something. It was roughly ten in the morning when he first encountered the entrance to the fated Tomb. Arthur Callender was the one who first shouted out. \n\"Carter! I see the top of a staircase!\"\nCarter almost felt giddy. Finally, something. There were to be sixteen steps on that staircase, and they carefully worked until the detritus and debris were safely removed from the area. Howard, with his suit and mustache, looked quite out of place against the hot sand. \"Now that the whole of the sealed doorway was laid bare various seal impressions bearing the cartouche of  Tût-ankh-Amen were discernible, more in particular in the lower portion of the plastering of the doorway where the impressions were clearest. In the upper part of this sealed doorway, traces of two distinct re-openings and successive re-closings disclosed were apparent, and that the sealed seal impressions first noticed on Nov. 5 of the Royal Necropolis - i.e., 'Anubis over Nine Foes', had been used for the re-closing. Here was evidence of at least the reign of the discovered tomb, but its true significance was still a puzzle, for, in the lower rubbish that filled the stair-case entrance, we found masses of broken potsherds and broken boxes, the latter bearing the names and protocol of Akhenaten, Smenkh-Ka-Ra, and Tut-ankh-Amen, and with what was even more upsetting a scarab of Tehutimes III, as well as a fragment bearing the cartouche of Amenhetep III. These conflicting data led us, for a time to believe that we were about to open a royal cache of the El Amarna branch of the XVIIIth Dyn. Monarchs, and that {the} from the evidence mentioned above it had been probably opened and used more than once.\" - Carter's Diary 24 Nov. 1922.\n***\n4:30 PM - 24 November 1922 - KV62, N.E. corner of the entrance to the tomb of Ramses VI, Valley of the Kings\nCallender had finally reached the first of the doorways to the tomb. As he reached out to touch the door, his hand shook slightly. Lord Carvanon stood atop the staircase, his tophat standing higher than seemed possible against the sky. He had a fever in his eyes. To his left stood Engelbach, a Chief inspector at the Antiquities Department; he had brought company with him this evening, and they were eager to see the excavation. But they seemed to be eager in a different manner. Carter didn't much like the man, or his photographer friend Harry Burton, as the first just seemed... off. The way they spoke was different from that of one given to his craft. Carter bounded down the stairs, being careful not to trip. \n\"We are here upon a mystery indeed,\" he murmured, looking closer at the stones.\nHis fingers traced the hieroglyphic characters on the lintel. They read \"Tutankhamun\", and below it, \"Horus\". The name meant \"crowned one\" or \"king crowned with glory\". The odd thing was that he would have sworn the doors to this tomb had been opened before. It certainly appeared... \n\"Carter, do you think this tomb has been opened before?\" Callender asked in a reverent quiet voice. He turned to the man and smiled. \n\"Callender my friend, you and I... you and I... \" he let this float off into the hot Egyptian air and turned back to the door. \n\"Well? Lord Carvanon barked from above in his deep voice, \"What of it, Carter?\" \n\"We should hold fast till tomorrow to make sure we are out of the heat of the day, but it looks good!\" he replied. \n\"It does indeed appear we are not the first to visit this burial. See here? This carving depicts Pharaoh Tutankhamun, with Horus the falcon god on his head, standing before Osiris, the lord of the dead.\"\nThe hole they were standing in was deep, and the stairs steep so the huddled group of men were crammed together at the door of the burial chamber.\n\"And see there?\" he pointed. \"A cartouche, carved in stone, depicting King Tut himself.\"\nThere was a sudden flurry of activity as the other diggers began moving in to see the drawing. Murmurs broke out like wildfire. \n***\n7:00 AM - 25 November 1922 - The Doorway to the tomb of Tût-ankh-Amen\nThey gathered at seven and pretended that they had actually slept that night. How could one sleep with such a mystery at hand?\nCarter scribbled in his notebook, \"Noted seals\". \n\"Okay! I think we can begin.\" He called up to Lord Carvanon.\nLord Carnarvon came forward, his hands clasped behind his back, and gazed down intently on the doorway. The light from his torch played across his features and illuminated his strong jawline. He was dressed in his usual garb, consisting of a linen shirt and breeches. He was eager to see what lay behind those stones.\nCarvanon moved to stand beside him. Both men stood quietly, gazing down at the door, their faces reflecting the awe and excitement of the moment. There was a slight breeze blowing around them, carrying away the dust stirred up during the last few days' excavations. The seals of Tût-ankh-Amen and the Royal Necropolis stared back at them from the stone door. It took a huge effort from Callendar and Carter, along with the other excavators, to move the stone door, but once it had been moved aside, the oddest sight greeted their eyes. The descending slope of a passage filled to the brim with little white stone chips. Almost like a Stoney beach, carter thought. But then, where did all these chips come from? They must have been carried here by the flood waters of the Nile.\nHe looked up the staircase. \"We're going to need some help,\" he said to Carvanon.\nAs they cleared the stones, they encountered bits of pottery and seals from burial shrouds that gave the increasing impression that the tomb had been looted in the past. In fact, many of the pieces bore the name 'Tutankhamen'. Some even bore the image of Pharaoh himself. One piece, a small clay vase, caught Callendar's eye. On top of the lid of the vessel was scratched the name of a man named Amenemhet, who would later be known as Akhenamun.\nCallendar handed it to Carter, whose pencil raced over the page. As if reading off a list, he wrote, 'Hatshepsut', 'Nefertiti' and 'Akhnaten.' \n\"After clearing 9 metres of the descending passage, in about\nthe middle of the afternoon, we came upon a second sealed\ndoorway, which was almost the exact replica of the first. It\nbore similar seal impressions and had similar traces of\nsuccessive re-openings and re-closings in the plastering.\nThe seal impressions were of Tût-ankh-Amen and of the Royal\nNecropolis, but not in any way so clear as those on the\nfirst doorway. The entrance and passage both in plan and in\nstyle resembled almost to measurement the tomb containing\nthe cache of Akhenaten discovered by Davis in the very near\nvicinity; which seemed to substantiate our first conjecture\nthat we had found a cache. \nFeverishly we cleared away the remaining last scraps\nof rubbish on the floor of the passage before the doorway until\nwe had only the clean sealed doorway before us. In which,\nafter making preliminary notes, we made a tiny breach in the top\nleft-hand corner to see what was beyond. Darkness and the iron testing\nrod told us that there was empty space. Perhaps another descending\nstaircase, in accordance with the ordinary royal Theban tomb plan?\nOr maybe a chamber? Candles were procured - the all-important Tell-Tale for foul gases when opening \nan ancient subterranean excavation - \nOn 19 March 1923, Carnarvon suffered a severe mosquito bite which became infected by a razor cut. On 5 April, he died in the Continental-Savoy Hotel in Cairo, caused, according to contemporaneous reports, by blood poisoning progressing to pneumonia. On 14 April, Lady Almina Carnarvon moved Lord Carnarvon's remains to England. His tomb appropriately reflects his archaeological interest, nestled within an ancient hill fort overlooking his family seat at Beacon Hill, Burghclere, Hampshire. Carnarvon was survived by his wife Almina, who subsequently remarried, and their two children.\n***\nThe air was full of the dusty substance that had surrounded those white stones, and it was difficult to breathe. Carter was filthy, and the group was exhausted. Carter widened the breach in the stone doorway with his chisel, leaning close to the doorway. It was too dark. He held the candle up and peered past the flickering flame. Lady Carvanon, Lady Evelyn, Arthur Callender, all waiting with bated breath. It took Carter almost a minute for his eyes to adjust to the low light. \"It was sometime before one could see; the hot air escaping caused the candle to flicker, but as soon as one's eyes became accustomed to the glimmer of light the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one, with its strange and wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another. There was naturally short suspense for those present who could not see when Lord Carnarvon said to me 'Can you see anything?'. I replied to him. Yes, it is wonderful.\"\n***\nChapter Nine - The Antechamber of a King\nMace would later recall the unusual group of people that gathered to see the Tomb of Tut. The Allenbys, the Queen of the Belgians, and Prince Leopold were seated opposite the Macy's Lady Evelyn, The Maudseleys, Thomases, Miss Putnam, the Thompsons, Hetheringtons, Doctors Breasted, Capart, Allan, Gardiner, and the Davies, Mertons, and the like were all scattered about in the dining space. They were gathered for the viewing of a king. The Queen would prove to be an annoyance to the passionate Carter in her persistent visits over the coming months, while her companion was content to smoke and conversate with the locals while she gawked at the underworld. \n***",

JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE  THE CAREW MURDER CASE  INCIDENT OF THE LETTER  INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON  INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW  THE LAST NIGHT  DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE  HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE STORY OF THE DOOR Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour. No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted. It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger. Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages. Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed. “Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he, “with a very odd story.” “Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what was that?” “Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child’s family, which was only natural. But the doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all set off, the doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.” “Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson. “I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s a bad story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?” “A likely place, isn’t it?” returned Mr. Enfield. “But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.” “And you never asked about the—place with the door?” said Mr. Utterson. “No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply. “I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.” “A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer. “But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr. Enfield. “It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there. And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and another begins.” The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,” said Mr. Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours.” “Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield. “But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to ask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.” “Well,” said Mr. Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do. It was a man of the name of Hyde.” “Hm,” said Mr. Utterson. “What sort of a man is he to see?” “He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn’t specify the point. He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can’t describe him. And it’s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment.” Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. “You are sure he used a key?” he inquired at last. “My dear sir...” began Enfield, surprised out of himself. “Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it.” “I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of sullenness. “But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still. I saw him use it not a week ago.” Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed. “Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he. “I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again.” “With all my heart,” said the lawyer. “I shake hands on that, Richard.” SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll’s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his “friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,” but that in case of Dr. Jekyll’s “disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,” the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll’s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor’s household. This document had long been the lawyer’s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend. “I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.” With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients. “If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company. After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind. “I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?” “I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr. Lanyon. “But I suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.” “Indeed?” said Utterson. “I thought you had a bond of common interest.” “We had,” was the reply. “But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias.” This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. “They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that!” He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. “Did you ever come across a _protégé_ of his—one Hyde?” he asked. “Hyde?” repeated Lanyon. “No. Never heard of him. Since my time.” That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions. Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred. From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post. “If he be Mr. Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr. Seek.” And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home. Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. “Mr. Hyde, I think?” Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: “That is my name. What do you want?” “I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer. “I am an old friend of Dr. Jekyll’s—Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.” “You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr. Hyde, blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, “How did you know me?” he asked. “On your side,” said Mr. Utterson “will you do me a favour?” “With pleasure,” replied the other. “What shall it be?” “Will you let me see your face?” asked the lawyer. Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. “Now I shall know you again,” said Mr. Utterson. “It may be useful.” “Yes,” returned Mr. Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and _à propos_, you should have my address.” And he gave a number of a street in Soho. “Good God!” thought Mr. Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. “And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?” “By description,” was the reply. “Whose description?” “We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson. “Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?” “Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer. “He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.” “Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.” The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. “There must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman. “There _is_ something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.” Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door. “Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?” asked the lawyer. “I will see, Mr. Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. “Will you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?” “Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out. “I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said. “Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?” “Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,” replied the servant. “Mr. Hyde has a key.” “Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole,” resumed the other musingly. “Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole. “We have all orders to obey him.” “I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?” asked Utterson. “O, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here,” replied the butler. “Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory.” “Well, good-night, Poole.” “Good-night, Mr. Utterson.” And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. “Poor Harry Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. “This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only let me.” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will. DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection. “I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter. “You know that will of yours?” A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. “My poor Utterson,” said he, “you are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he’s a good fellow—you needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.” “You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic. “My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply. “You have told me so.” “Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer. “I have been learning something of young Hyde.” The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. “I do not care to hear more,” said he. “This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.” “What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson. “It can make no change. You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. “I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.” “Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.” “My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.” Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire. “I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to his feet. “Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.” “I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer. “I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here.” Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. “Well,” said he, “I promise.” THE CAREW MURDER CASE Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson. This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. “I shall say nothing till I have seen the body,” said he; “this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait while I dress.” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded. “Yes,” said he, “I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew.” “Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible?” And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. “This will make a deal of noise,” he said. “And perhaps you can help us to the man.” And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick. Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll. “Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?” he inquired. “Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,” said the officer. Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come with me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house.” It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s officers, which may at times assail the most honest. As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday. “Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you who this person is,” he added. “This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard.” A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face. “Ah!” said she, “he is in trouble! What has he done?” Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. “He don’t seem a very popular character,” observed the latter. “And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.” In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer’s credit, completed his gratification. “You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr. Utterson: “I have him in my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money’s life to the man. We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills.” This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders. INCIDENT OF THE LETTER It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor’s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice. “And now,” said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have heard the news?” The doctor shuddered. “They were crying it in the square,” he said. “I heard them in my dining-room.” “One word,” said the lawyer. “Carew was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?” “Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.” The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish manner. “You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.” “I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you may advise me. I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you.” “You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?” asked the lawyer. “No,” said the other. “I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed.” Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s selfishness, and yet relieved by it. “Well,” said he, at last, “let me see the letter.” The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions. “Have you the envelope?” he asked. “I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about. But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.” “Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?” asked Utterson. “I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply. “I have lost confidence in myself.” “Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer. “And now one word more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance?” The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth tight and nodded. “I knew it,” said Utterson. “He meant to murder you. You had a fine escape.” “I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have had!” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands. On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. “By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; “and only circulars by that,” he added. This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition. Shocking murder of an M.P.” That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for. Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might shape his future course. “This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said. “Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,” returned Guest. “The man, of course, was mad.” “I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson. “I have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph.” Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion. “No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand.” “And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer. Just then the servant entered with a note. “Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?” inquired the clerk. “I thought I knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?” “Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?” “One moment. I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. “Thank you, sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting autograph.” There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself. “Why did you compare them, Guest?” he inquired suddenly. “Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.” “Rather quaint,” said Utterson. “It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest. “I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master. “No, sir,” said the clerk. “I understand.” But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. “What!” he thought. “Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!” And his blood ran cold in his veins. INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace. On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. “The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and saw no one.” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon’s. There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. “Yes,” he thought; “he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bear.” And yet when Utterson remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man. “I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away.” “Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson. “Have you seen him?” But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. “I wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice. “I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.” “Tut, tut!” said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, “Can’t I do anything?” he inquired. “We are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.” “Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself.” “He will not see me,” said the lawyer. “I am not surprised at that,” was the reply. “Some day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear it.” As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. “I do not blame our old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence.” Utterson was amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground. A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. “PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. “I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this should cost me another?” And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.” Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe. It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits. INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it. “Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least. We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde.” “I hope not,” said Utterson. “Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?” “It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield. “And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll’s! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did.” “So you found it out, did you?” said Utterson. “But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good.” The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll. “What! Jekyll!” he cried. “I trust you are better.” “I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low. It will not last long, thank God.” “You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer. “You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my cousin—Mr. Enfield—Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us.” “You are very good,” sighed the other. “I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.” “Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.” “That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the doctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes. “God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr. Utterson. But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence. THE LAST NIGHT Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole. “Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?” he cried; and then taking a second look at him, “What ails you?” he added; “is the doctor ill?” “Mr. Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong.” “Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer. “Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.” “You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts himself up. Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I’m afraid.” “Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit. What are you afraid of?” “I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more.” The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor. “I can bear it no more,” he repeated. “Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.” “I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely. “Foul play!” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. “What foul play! What does the man mean?” “I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me and see for yourself?” Mr. Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow. It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken. “Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong.” “Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you, Poole?” “It’s all right,” said Poole. “Open the door.” The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying out “Bless God! it’s Mr. Utterson,” ran forward as if to take him in her arms. “What, what? Are you all here?” said the lawyer peevishly. “Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.” “They’re all afraid,” said Poole. Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly. “Hold your tongue!” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. “And now,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a candle, and we’ll get this through hands at once.” And then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden. “Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can. I want you to hear, and I don’t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, don’t go.” Mr. Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door. “Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear. A voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said complainingly. “Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor. “Sir,” he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s voice?” “It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look. “Changed? Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler. “Have I been twenty years in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir; master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who’s_ in there instead of him, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!” “This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,” said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. “Suppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been—well, murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend itself to reason.” “Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it yet,” said Poole. “All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair. We’ve had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.” “Have you any of these papers?” asked Mr. Utterson. Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents ran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose. In the year 18—, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had broken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.” “This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do you come to have it open?” “The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,” returned Poole. “This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the lawyer. “I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said. “I’ve seen him!” “Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?” “That’s it!” said Poole. “It was this way. I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from me? I have served him long enough. And then...” The man paused and passed his hand over his face. “These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr. Utterson, “but I think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery—God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms.” “Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that thing was not my master, and there’s the truth. My master”—here he looked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf.” Utterson attempted to protest. “O, sir,” cried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years? Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr. Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr. Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.” “Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.” “Ah, Mr. Utterson, that’s talking!” cried the butler. “And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to do it?” “Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply. “That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.” “There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself.” The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it. “Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?” “You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler. “It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other. “We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?” “Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that,” was the answer. “But if you mean, was it Mr. Hyde?—why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But that’s not all. I don’t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?” “Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him.” “Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thin.” “I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr. Utterson. “Quite so, sir,” returned Poole. “Well, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr. Utterson; I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!” “Ay, ay,” said the lawyer. “My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I fear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection. Ay truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.” The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous. “Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer. “This suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.” As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. “And now, Poole, let us get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor. “So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, there’s a bit of a break. Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an enemy to rest! Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it! But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot?” The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. “Is there never anything else?” he asked. Poole nodded. “Once,” he said. “Once I heard it weeping!” “Weeping? how that?” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror. “Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler. “I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.” But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night. “Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you.” He paused a moment, but there came no reply. “I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if not by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute force!” “Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy!” “Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s!” cried Utterson. “Down with the door, Poole!” Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet. The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London. Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer. “We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish. Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your master.” The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive. Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,” he said, hearkening to the sound. “Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust. “This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer. “Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it.” “Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two men looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said the lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.” They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. “That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in. “This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole. “And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same tones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with it?” he said. “You may say that!” said Poole. Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet. “My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.” He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand and dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.” “Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole. “Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no cause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows: “My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of “Your unworthy and unhappy friend, “HENRY JEKYLL.” “There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson. “Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places. The lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.” They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained. DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran: “10_th December_, 18—. “Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself. “I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its contents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands. “That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason. “Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save “Your friend, “H.J. “P.S.—I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.” Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll’s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman’s surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square. Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure!!!” All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. “Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked. He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste. These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred. This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world. These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement. “Have you got it?” he cried. “Have you got it?” And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me. I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood. “Come, sir,” said I. “You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.” And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster. “I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough. “What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria—“I understood, a drawer...” But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity. “There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet. He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason. “Compose yourself,” said I. He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have you a graduated glass?” he asked. I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked. He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny. “And now,” said he, “to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.” “Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.” “It is well,” replied my visitor. “Lanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors—behold!” He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror. “O God!” I screamed, and “O God!” again and again; for there before my eyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll! What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll’s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew. HASTIE LANYON. HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man’s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they dissociated? I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul. I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion. The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature. There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night however, was far gone into the morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde. I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll. That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position. Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it—I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll. The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience slumbered. Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate. Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size; it was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde. I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse. Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father’s interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference. To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it. Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught. I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel! The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him. I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation. There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows. My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end. Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say—I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled. When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon’s condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope. I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught. About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\n",

I remember the day I met her there. A little girl with her mother, and the sound of that wind shifting whispering grass. It felt like magic. She stood out amongst the others because she was so young, and yet so wise. Her name was Maria, and though we never spoke much together, our eyes always seemed to meet across the room, or on the street corner. We had years together, as children young and in love. ",
