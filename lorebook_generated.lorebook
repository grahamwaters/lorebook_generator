Opened in 1930, it contains 1,083 rooms and is classified as a mid priced hotel. The 1 million square foot building offers two restaurants and approximately 33,000 square feet of conference space.The New Yorker Hotel was successful in its early years, hosting many famous personalities. In the 1950s, the hotel was sold multiple times, including to Hilton Hotels. By the time Hilton reacquired the New Yorker Hotel in 1967, it had become unprofitable and Hilton closed it in 1972. The Unification Church purchased the building in 1975, and two decades later, elected to convert a portion of the building to use as a hotel again. Since re opening as a hotel in 1994, the New Yorker Hotel has undergone approximately 100 million in capital improvements, including lobby and room renovations and infrastructure modernization. It has been part of the Wyndham Hotels Resorts chain since 2014.  History   Construction and early years  The New Yorker Hotel was built by Garment Center developer Mack Kanner. When the project was announced in 1928, the Sugarman and Berger designed building was planned to be 38 stories, at an estimated cost of 8 million. However, when it was completed in 1929, the building had grown to 43 stories, at a final cost of 22.5 million and contained 2,500 rooms, making it the city's largest for many years. Hotel management pioneer Ralph Hitz was selected as its first manager, eventually becoming president of the National Hotel Management Company. An early ad for the building boasted that the hotel's bell boys were 'as snappy looking as West Pointers' and that it had a radio in every room with a choice of four stations . It was a New Yorker bellboy, Johnny Roventini, who served as tobacco company Philip Morris' pitchman for twenty years, making famous their Call for Philip Morris advertising campaign.The hotel opened on January 2, 1930. Much like its contemporaries, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building , the New Yorker was designed in the Art Deco style which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In his book New York 1930 Robert A. M. Stern said the New Yorker's virtually unornamented facades consisted of alternating vertical bands of warm gray brick and windows, yielding an impression of boldly modeled masses. This was furthered by the deep cut light courts, which produced a powerful play of light and shade that was enhanced by dramatic lighting at night . In addition to the ballrooms there were ten private dining salons and five restaurants employing 35 master cooks. There were twenty six murals painted in the hotel by Lajos Louis Jambor. The barber shop was one of the largest in the world with 42 chairs and 20 manicurists. There were 95 switchboard operators and 150 laundry staff washing as many as 350,000 pieces daily. In his final years, the inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the hotel's room 3327 and died there penniless on January 7, 1943.  Mid and late 20th century  Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel was among New York's most fashionable. The New York Observer noted that in the building's heyday, actors, celebrities, athletes, politicians, mobsters, the shady and the luminous the entire Brooklyn Dodgers roster during the glory seasons would stalk the bars and ballrooms, or romp upstairs ;In May 1949, the hotel hosted the first concurrent annual meetings of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and the International Ice Hockey Federation.It hosted many popular Big Bands, such as Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, while notable figures such as Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford and Fidel Castro stayed there. Inventor Nikola Tesla spent the last ten years of his life in near seclusion in Suite 3327, where he died, largely devoting his time to feeding pigeons while occasionally meeting dignitaries. In later years, Muhammad Ali would recuperate there after his March 1971 fight against Joe Frazier at the Garden.Notwithstanding its early success, New York's changing economy and demographics caused the building to slowly decline and, as a result, its ownership changed several times. It was purchased by Hilton Hotels in 1953 for 12.5 million and following an antitrust suit by the federal government, was sold just three years later, in 1956, for 20 million to Massaglia Hotels. In 1959, Massaglia sold the hotel to an investment syndicate known as New York Towers Ltd., which went bankrupt, allowing Hilton to reacquire the building in 1967.By the time Hilton reacquired the hotel, the pronounced decline in New York's fortunes, coupled with the construction of new, more modern hotels, caused the New Yorker to become unprofitable. As a result, Hilton closed the hotel in April 1972.Though the building was initially left vacant, several proposals were made, including redevelopment as a low income housing development, and a hospital. Ultimately, in 1975, it was purchased by the Unification Church of the United States for 5.6 million. The church converted much of the building for use by its members.  Reopening  In 1994, the Unification Church elected to convert a portion of the building to use as a hotel again and the New Yorker Hotel Management Company took over operation of the building. It began the largest renovation project in the New Yorker's nearly 65 year history, completed in 1999, with 20 million in capital improvements. The hotel joined the Ramada chain in 2000. In 2005, the hotel's management began the process of replacing the New Yorker's famous sign, which hadn't been lit since 1967 and was badly in need of repair. The sign was completely replaced by an energy efficient LED sign that was installed in time to celebrate the hotel's 75th anniversary. A 75th anniversary celebratory event was held at the hotel on December 8, 2005, where the new sign was officially switched on for the first time by Dr. Charles Yang, President of the New Yorker Hotel Management Company, Kevin H. Smith, the hotel's General Manager, Alan Ostroff, of the Cornell University School of Hotel Management, Jeanne Cummins, vocalist of the Bernie Cummins Orchestra, the hotel's house band in the 1930s and Patricia Hitz Bradshaw, granddaughter of Ralph Hitz, the hotel's first General Manager.In August 2007, the hotel began a second capital improvement program, which was completed in February 2009 at a final cost of 70 million. These improvements increased the number of guest rooms available from 178 in 1994 to 912, located on floors 19 through 40. The renovation project was designed by Stonehill Taylor Architects. Interior improvements included room restructuring and augmentation . Other improvements included a refurbished front entrance, lobby redesign, foyer reconstruction, and ballroom renovations. The hotel also expanded its Wi Fi and PDA support, and added high definition flat screen televisions in all rooms. In addition, individual room air conditioning units were replaced with modern centralized heating and cooling systems throughout the entire hotel. In 2009, conference room space was added to the hotel through the conversion of a defunct Manufacturer's Hanover Bank branch in the hotel, bringing the total meeting space to just over 33,000 square feet , in two ballrooms and twelve conference rooms. The New Yorker Hotel joined the Wyndham Hotels chain in March 2014. Wyndham has undertaken additional upgrades to the hotel, including lobby and restaurant renovations, to attract more business travelers in anticipation of the massive Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project to the west.  Power plant When it was built, the New Yorker Hotel had coal fired steam boilers and generators sufficient to produce more than 2,200 kilowatts of direct current electric power. At the time, this was the largest private power plant in the United States. The hotel's own direct current generators were still in use during the Northeast Blackout of 1965, but by the late 1960s the hotel's power system had been modernized to alternating current. In a dedication ceremony held on September 25, 2008, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers named the New Yorker Hotel's direct current power plant a Milestone in Electrical Engineering. A bronze plaque commemorating the achievement was presented to the hotel by IEEE.  Replica The New York New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains a replica of the New Yorker Hotel, which measures 38 stories tall. A portion of the New York New York's interior was also designed to resemble the New Yorker Hotel's interior.  References   External links  Official website Official Chain website",

            "text": "Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian born American film actress and inventor. A film star during Hollywood's golden age, Lamarr has been described as one of the greatest movie actresses of all time.After a brief early film career in Czechoslovakia, including the controversial Ecstasy , she fled from her husband, a wealthy Austrian ammunition manufacturer, and secretly moved to Paris. Traveling to London, she met Metro Goldwyn Mayer studio head Louis B. Mayer, who offered her a movie contract in Hollywood. She became a film star with her performance in Algiers . Her MGM films include Lady of the Tropics , Boom Town , H.M. Pulham, Esq. , and White Cargo . Her greatest success was as Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's Bible inspired Samson and Delilah . She also acted on television before the release of her final film, The Female Animal . She was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. At the beginning of World War II, she and avant garde composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers.  Early life Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, the only child of Gertrud Trude Kiesler and Emil Kiesler . Her father, Emil, was born to a Galician Jewish family in Lemberg and was in 1920s deputy director of Wiener Bankverein, and in the end of his life a director at the united Creditanstalt Bankverein. Trude, her mother, a pianist and Budapest native, had come from an upper class Hungarian Jewish family. She had converted to Catholicism and was described as a practicing Christian who raised her daughter as a Christian, although Hedy was not formally baptized at the time.: 8 As a child, Lamarr showed an interest in acting and was fascinated by theatre and film. At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest in Vienna. She also began to associate invention with her father, who would take her out on walks, explaining how technology functioned.: c. 7m 05s 8m00s  European film career   Early work  Lamarr was taking acting classes in Vienna when one day, she forged a note from her mother and went to Sascha Film and was able to get herself hired as a script girl. While there, she was able to get a role as an extra in Money on the Street , and then a small speaking part in Storm in a Water Glass . Producer Max Reinhardt then cast her in a play entitled The Weaker Sex, which was performed at the Theater in der Josefstadt. Reinhardt was so impressed with her that he brought her with him back to Berlin.However, she never actually trained with Reinhardt or appeared in any of his Berlin productions. Instead, she met the Russian theatre producer Alexis Granowsky, who cast her in his film directorial debut, The Trunks of Mr. O.F. , starring Walter Abel and Peter Lorre. Granowsky soon moved to Paris, but Lamarr stayed in Berlin and was given the lead role in No Money Needed , a comedy directed by Carl Boese. Lamarr then starred in the film which made her internationally famous.  Ecstasy  In early 1933, at age 18, Lamarr was given the lead in Gustav Machat 's film Ecstasy . She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man. The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr's face in the throes of orgasm as well as close up and brief nude scenes. Lamarr claimed she was duped by the director and producer, who used high power telephoto lenses, but other people related to the movie contested her claims.Although she was dismayed and now disillusioned about taking other roles, the film gained world recognition after winning an award in Rome. Throughout Europe, it was regarded an artistic work. In America it was considered overly sexual and received negative publicity, especially among women's groups. It was banned there and in Germany.  Withdrawal  Lamarr played a number of stage roles, including a starring one in Sissy, a play about Empress Elisabeth of Austria produced in Vienna. It won accolades from critics. Admirers sent roses to her dressing room and tried to get backstage to meet her. She sent most of them away, including a man who was more insistent, Friedrich Mandl. He became obsessed with getting to know her.Mandl was an Austrian military arms merchant and munitions manufacturer who was reputedly the third richest man in Austria. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial wealth. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl's ties to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, and later, German F hrer Adolf Hitler, but they could not stop the headstrong Lamarr.On August 10, 1933, Lamarr married Mandl at the Karlskirche. She was 18 years old and he was 33. In her alleged autobiography Ecstasy and Me, she described Mandl as an extremely controlling husband who strongly objected to her simulated orgasm scene in Ecstasy and prevented her from pursuing her acting career. She claimed she was kept a virtual prisoner in their castle home, Schloss Schwarzenau. Mandl had close social and business ties to the Italian government, selling munitions to the country, and although like Hedy, his own father was Jewish, had ties to the Nazi regime of Germany, as well. Lamarr wrote that the dictators of both countries attended lavish parties at the Mandl home. Lamarr accompanied Mandl to business meetings, where he conferred with scientists and other professionals involved in military technology. These conferences were her introduction to the field of applied science and nurtured her latent talent in science.Lamarr's marriage to Mandl eventually became unbearable, and she decided to separate herself from both her husband and country in 1937. In her alleged autobiography, she wrote that she disguised herself as her maid and fled to Paris, but by other accounts, she persuaded Mandl to let her wear all of her jewelry for a dinner party, then disappeared afterward. She writes about her marriage: I knew very soon that I could never be an actress while I was his wife. ... He was the absolute monarch in his marriage. ... I was like a doll. I was like a thing, some object of art which had to be guarded and imprisoned having no mind, no life of its own.  Hollywood career   Louis B. Mayer and MGM  After arriving in London in 1937, she met Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, who was scouting for talent in Europe. She initially turned down the offer he made her , but then booked herself onto the same New York bound liner as he, and managed to impress him enough to secure a 500 a week contract. Mayer persuaded her to change her name to Hedy Lamarr , choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star, Barbara La Marr, on the suggestion of his wife, who admired La Marr. He brought her to Hollywood in 1938 and began promoting her as the world's most beautiful woman .Mayer loaned Lamarr to producer Walter Wanger, who was making Algiers , an American version of the French film, P p le Moko . Lamarr was cast in the lead opposite Charles Boyer. The film created a national sensation , says Shearer.: 77 She was billed as an unknown but well publicized Austrian actress, which created anticipation in audiences. Mayer hoped she would become another Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich.: 77 According to one viewer, when her face first appeared on the screen, everyone gasped ... Lamarr's beauty literally took one's breath away. : 2 In future Hollywood films, she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin. Her second American film was to be I Take This Woman, co starring with Spencer Tracy under the direction of regular Dietrich collaborator Josef von Sternberg. Von Sternberg was fired during the shoot, replaced by Frank Borzage. The film was put on hold, and Lamarr was put into Lady of the Tropics , where she played a mixed race seductress in Saigon opposite Robert Taylor. She returned to I Take This Woman, re shot by W. S. Van Dyke. The resulting film was a flop. Far more popular was Boom Town with Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert and Spencer Tracy; it made 5 million. MGM promptly reteamed Lamarr and Gable in Comrade X , a comedy film in the vein of Ninotchka , which was another hit. Lamarr was teamed with James Stewart in Come Live with Me , playing a Viennese refugee. Stewart was also in Ziegfeld Girl , where Lamarr, Judy Garland and Lana Turner played aspiring showgirls a big success.Lamarr was top billed in H. M. Pulham, Esq. , although the film's protagonist was the title role played by Robert Young. She made a third film with Tracy, Tortilla Flat . It was successful at the box office, as was Crossroads with William Powell. Lamarr played the exotic Arab seductress Tondelayo in White Cargo , top billed over Walter Pidgeon. It was a huge hit. White Cargo contains arguably her most memorable film quote, delivered with provocative invitation: I am Tondelayo. I make tiffin for you? This line typifies many of Lamarr's roles, which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines. The lack of acting challenges bored Lamarr. She reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.She was reunited with Powell in a comedy The Heavenly Body , then was borrowed by Warner Bros for The Conspirators . This was an attempt to repeat the success of Casablanca , and RKO borrowed her for a melodrama Experiment Perilous . Back at MGM Lamarr was teamed with Robert Walker in the romantic comedy Her Highness and the Bellboy , playing a princess who falls in love with a New Yorker. It was very popular, but would be the last film she made under her MGM contract.Her off screen life and personality during those years was quite different from her screen image. She spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent's pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression: Hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them, and she forces herself to be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve. Author Richard Rhodes describes her assimilation into American culture: Of all the European migr s who escaped Nazi Germany and Nazi Austria, she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full fledged star herself. There were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally. She really was a resourceful human being I think because of her father's strong influence on her as a child. Lamarr also had a penchant for speaking about herself in the third person.  Wartime fundraiser  Lamarr wanted to join the National Inventors Council, but was reportedly told by NIC member Charles F. Kettering and others that she could better help the war effort by using her celebrity status to sell war bonds.She participated in a war bond selling campaign with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would kiss Rhodes and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.  Producer  After leaving MGM in 1945, Lamarr formed a production company with Jack Chertok and made the thriller The Strange Woman . It went over budget and only made minor profits.She and Chertok then made Dishonored Lady , another thriller starring Lamarr, which also went over budget but was not a commercial success. She tried a comedy with Robert Cummings, Let's Live a Little .  Later films  Lamarr enjoyed her biggest success playing Delilah against Victor Mature as the Biblical strongman in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah, the highest grossing film of 1950. The film also won two Oscars.Lamarr returned to MGM for a film noir with John Hodiak, A Lady Without Passport , which flopped. More popular were two pictures she made at Paramount, a Western with Ray Milland, Copper Canyon , and a Bob Hope spy spoof, My Favorite Spy . Her career went into decline. She went to Italy to play multiple roles in Loves of Three Queens , which she also produced. However she lacked the experience necessary to make a success of such an epic production, and lost millions of dollars when she was unable to secure distribution of the picture. She was Joan of Arc in Irwin Allen's critically panned epic, The Story of Mankind and did episodes of Zane Grey Theatre and Shower of Stars . Her last film was a thriller The Female Animal . Lamarr was signed to act in the 1966 film Picture Mommy Dead, but was let go when she collapsed during filming from nervous exhaustion. She was replaced in the role of Jessica Flagmore Shelley by Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Inventor  Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self taught, she tinkered in her spare time on various hobbies and ideas, which included a traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink. The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka Seltzer. During World War II, Lamarr read that radio controlled torpedoes had been proposed. However an enemy might be able to jam such a torpedo's guidance system and set it off course. When discussing this with her friend the composer and pianist George Antheil, the idea was raised that a frequency hopping signal might prevent the torpedo's radio guidance system from being tracked or jammed. Antheil succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player piano mechanism with radio signals. Antheil sketched out the idea for the frequency hopping system, which was to use a perforated paper tape which actuated pneumatic controls . Antheil was introduced to Samuel Stuart Mackeown, a professor of radio electrical engineering at Caltech, whom Lamarr then employed for a year to actually develop the functionality of the idea. Lamarr also hired the Los Angeles legal firm of Lyon Lyon to search for prior knowledge, and to craft the application for the patent which was granted under US Patent 2,292,387 on August 11, 1942 . In 1997, Lamarr and Antheil received the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award and the Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society. In 2014, Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.However, neither the US Navy nor that of any other nation were using radio controlled torpedoes at the time, and electro mechanical devices such as these were soon to be made obsolete by purely electronic controls. Furthermore, spread spectrum frequency hopping was not a new idea: as early as 1899, Guglielmo Marconi had experimented with frequency selective reception in an attempt to minimize radio interference, Nikola Tesla had written extensively about it in the first quarter of the 20th century, in 1929 the Polish engineer and inventor Leonard Danilewicz further elaborated on the idea, and in 1932 US Patent 1869659A was issued to the Dutch inventor, William Broertjes for his electromechanical device to encrypt radio transmissions by using frequency hopping. Although the U.S. Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are incorporated into Bluetooth and GPS technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of CDMA and Wi Fi. This work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.  Later years Lamarr became a naturalized citizen of the United States at age 38 on April 10, 1953. Her alleged autobiography, Ecstasy and Me, was published in 1966. She said on TV that it was not written by her, and much of it was fictional. Lamarr later sued the publisher, saying that many details were fabricated by its ghost writer, Leo Guild. Lamarr, in turn, was sued by Gene Ringgold, who asserted that the book plagiarized material from an article he had written in 1965 for Screen Facts magazine.In the late 1950s Lamarr designed and, with then husband W. Howard Lee, developed the Villa LaMarr ski resort in Aspen, Colorado.In 1966, Lamarr was arrested in Los Angeles for shoplifting. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in Florida, this time for stealing 21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She pleaded no contest to avoid a court appearance, and the charges were dropped in return for her promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year.The 1970s was a decade of increasing seclusion for Lamarr. She was offered several scripts, television commercials, and stage projects, but none piqued her interest. In 1974, she filed a 10 million lawsuit against Warner Bros., claiming that the running parody of her name in the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles infringed her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for an undisclosed nominal sum and an apology to Lamarr for almost using her name . Brooks said that Lamarr never got the joke . With her eyesight failing, Lamarr retreated from public life and settled in Miami Beach, Florida, in 1981.A large Corel drawn image of Lamarr won CorelDRAW's yearly software suite cover design contest in 1996. For several years, beginning in 1997, it was featured on boxes of the software suite. Lamarr sued the company for using her image without her permission. Corel countered that she did not own rights to the image. The parties reached an undisclosed settlement in 1998.For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Lamarr has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6247 Hollywood Blvd adjacent to Vine Street where the walk is centered. Lamarr became estranged from her older son, James Lamarr Loder, when he was 12 years old. Their relationship ended abruptly, and he moved in with another family. They did not speak again for almost 50 years. Lamarr left James Loder out of her will, and he sued for control of the US 3.3 million estate left by Lamarr in 2000. He eventually settled for US 50,000.  Seclusion  In the last decades of her life, the telephone became Lamarr's only means of communication with the outside world, even with her children and close friends. She often talked up to six or seven hours a day on the phone, but she spent hardly any time with anyone in person in her final years.  Death  Lamarr died in Casselberry, Florida, on January 19, 2000, of heart disease, aged 85. Her son Anthony Loder spread her ashes in Austria's Vienna Woods in accordance with her last wishes.In 2014 a memorial to Lamarr was unveiled in Vienna's Central Cemetery.  Awards and tributes Hedy Lamarr was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.In 1939, Lamarr was selected the most promising new actress of 1938 in a poll of area voters conducted by Philadelphia Record film critic.

            "text": "The Current War is a 2017 American historical drama film inspired by the 19th century competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse over which electric power delivery system would be used in the United States . Directed by Alfonso Gomez Rejon, written by Michael Mitnick, and executive produced by Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Edison, Michael Shannon as Westinghouse, Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, and Tom Holland as Samuel Insull, alongside Katherine Waterston, Tuppence Middleton, Matthew Macfadyen and Damien Molony. Announced in May 2012, Gomez Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. Originally to be distributed by The Weinstein Company, the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the sexual abuse allegations made against Harvey Weinstein. It was eventually bought by Weinstein Company successor Lantern Entertainment, which then sold domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a final cut privilege clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019. The film received generally mixed reviews, with praise towards the cast's performances and the intriguing story, but with criticism towards the overall execution.  Plot In 1880, Thomas Edison has unveiled his electric lightbulb. He plans to distribute power to American neighborhoods using Direct Current , which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight, but is limited in range and needs an expensive wiring infrastructure. George Westinghouse, a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove alternating current is the better technology, as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Westinghouse does an AC demonstration at Great Barrington in March 1886. Inventor Nikola Tesla arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse. Edison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind its technical merits. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck by personal tragedy when his friend Franklin Pope dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine The Phonograph . To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily electrocutes animals, and secretly works to help the creators of the electric chair, despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is William Kemmler, and newspapers label the event as Far Worse Than Hanging . Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press. After an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical AC motor. Edison is increasingly marginalized and J. P. Morgan merges Edison Electric into General Electric. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Samuel Insull presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The fair is abundantly lit, and Westinghouse is successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.  Cast   Production Michael Mitnick began writing the script for The Current War in 2008, basing it on the real life war of the currents AC DC conflict between Edison and Westinghouse. The screenplay is the conclusive result of sixty drafts, a ten year writing process, first as a musical and finally as a film. In 2011 Mitnick's screenplay made the Black List, an industry survey of most liked screenplays not yet produced. On May 3, 2012, it was reported that Timur Bekmambetov's company, Bazelevs, had acquired the rights to Mitnick's screenplay. Bekmambetov was set to direct. On March 31, 2014, it was reported that Ben Stiller was in negotiations to direct the film. As of September 24, 2015, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal were in talks to play Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, respectively, with Alfonso Gomez Rejon eyed to direct the film. Sacha Baron Cohen was also briefly linked to the role of Edison. On September 29, 2016, Michael Shannon was cast as Westinghouse, and on October 4, Nicholas Hoult was cast as Nikola Tesla. In November 2016, Katherine Waterston and Tom Holland joined the cast. The following month, Tuppence Middleton and Matthew Macfadyen were cast.Principal photography began on December 18, 2016, and took place in London and the surrounding areas, as well as Rothbury, Northumberland, where Cragside House was used as a location. Filming also took place at Brighton Pavilion. Home Farm in Swale, Kent, England was used as the exterior of Edison's residence.The film was submitted to the Toronto International Film Festival before post production was completed, and was subsequently rushed in order to make the late September 2017 premiere date. Following the generally unfavorable reception towards the film, director Gomez Rejon, who had voiced the film was not ready to be seen, began working on trimming the runtime for the planned November 2017 theatrical release. After the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein came to light, work on the film ceased as The Weinstein Company would eventually sell off the rights. Thanks to a clause in executive producer Martin Scorsese's contract, he had to approve all final cuts of the film, which resulted in Gomez Rejon's being able to raise 1 million to complete post production, as well as do one day of reshoots in England with Cumberbatch, Middleton and Hoult, rounding out their characters.  Music  The film's score was originally written by the composer duo of Dustin O Halloran Volker Bertelmann for the cut that was shown at TIFF in 2017. However this score was replaced entirely in 2019 for Gomez Rejon's director's cut by a new score written by composer duo Danny Bensi Saunder Jurriaans with additional music by Chase Deso. Neither score has yet received a soundtrack album release. The soundtrack for the director's cut also includes two movements from Max Richter's Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi The Four Seasons.  Release The film was originally scheduled to be released by The Weinstein Company on December 22, 2017, and then rescheduled for November 24, 2017. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. It was pulled from release following the sexual abuse allegations that arose against Harvey Weinstein, then co head of the company. Weinstein said that he was involved in the re editing of the film when it was made known that the allegations would be revealed.In October 2018, Lantern Entertainment, which acquired The Weinstein Company's assets through its bankruptcy, and 13 Films, an international distribution and finance company, struck a deal to co distribute the film internationally.In April 2019, it was announced 101 Studios had acquired distribution rights to the film for 3 million, and committed to a wide release. Director Gomez Rejon said since the Toronto premiere he had added five additional scenes and trimmed ten minutes from the runtime. It was released on July 26, 2019, in the UK and October 25, 2019, in the US, after being previously scheduled for October 4. The theatrical release included the subtitle The Director's Cut in all countries but the UK.  Home media  The film was first released on DVD, Blu ray and digital download in the UK by Entertainment in Video on November 18, 2019. In the United States, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for digital download on March 17, 2020 and later on DVD and Blu ray on March 31, 2020.  Reception   Box office  The Current War grossed 6 million in the United States and Canada, and 6.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of 12.3 million, against a production budget of 30 million.In the United States and Canada, The Current War was released alongside Black and Blue and Countdown, and was projected to gross around 3 million from 1,020 theaters in its opening weekend. It made 947,000 on its first day and went on to debut to 2.7 million, finishing ninth at the box office, although it was noted that it was a miracle that this Alfonso Gomez Rejon directed movie made its way to the big screen and wasn't jettisoned to streaming, or unseen forever .  Critical response   Original release  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the version of the film screened at Toronto International Film Festival has an approval rating of 32 based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80 10. The website's critical consensus reads, The Current War is powered by an outstanding cast and an intriguing, history inspired story, which makes this drama's low wattage all the more shocking. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews Reviewing the film after its 2017 premiere, David Rooney for The Hollywood Reporter wrote, For all its aggressive energy, The Current War is an uninvolving bore, making it unlikely to measure up as the kind of Oscar baity prestige entry The Weinstein Co. obviously had in mind. Also reviewing the original cut, Andrew Barker of Variety called the film flashy but unilluminating and saying that so little of The Current War's hustle and bustle serves much of a concrete purpose... The Current War feels like one of those earlier experiments temporary flash providing too little illumination. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, This is a watchably stylised period film, with interesting visual setpieces and faces looming up at us out of intricately contrived backgrounds. He concluded that the film is illuminating but perhaps not quite as much as it could have been. Dan Jolin of Empire magazine called the film a stylish portrayal of a literal power struggle based on truly interesting historical figures and events. But it tries to take in too much in too little time, when all it needed was to centre on Edison and Westinghouse.   Director's Cut  On Rotten Tomatoes, the Director's Cut version of the film has an approval rating of 61 based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.39 10. The website's critics consensus reads, If it lacks the powerful voltage that its impressive cast suggests, The Current War: Director's Cut represents a significant improvement over previous versions. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 81 .Michael Phillips, writing for the Chicago Tribune, gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, I never saw the earlier version of the film . This one remains a bit of a mess but a pretty interesting one, as well as one of the few films this year deserving of the adjective 'instructive.'

            "text": "Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi, 1st Marquis of Marconi was an Italian inventor and electrical engineer, known for his creation of a practical radio wave based wireless telegraph system. This led to Marconi being credited as the inventor of radio, and he shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy .Marconi was also an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of The Wireless Telegraph Signal Company in the United Kingdom in 1897 . In 1929, Marconi was ennobled as a Marchese by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and, in 1931, he set up Vatican Radio for Pope Pius XI.  Biography   Early years  Marconi was born into the Italian nobility as Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi in Palazzo Marescalchi in Bologna on 25 April 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi and his Irish wife Annie Jameson . Marconi had a brother, Alfonso, and a stepbrother, Luigi. Between the ages of two and six, Marconi and his elder brother Alfonso lived with their mother in the English town of Bedford.  Education  Marconi did not attend school as a child and did not go on to formal higher education. Instead, he learned chemistry, mathematics, and physics at home from a series of private tutors hired by his parents. His family hired additional tutors for Guglielmo in the winter when they would leave Bologna for the warmer climate of Tuscany or Florence. Marconi noted an important mentor was professor Vincenzo Rosa, a high school physics teacher in Livorno. Rosa taught the 17 year old Marconi the basics of physical phenomena as well as new theories on electricity. At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became acquainted with University of Bologna physicist Augusto Righi, who had done research on Heinrich Hertz's work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.  Radio work  From youth, Marconi was interested in science and electricity. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of wireless telegraphy i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the electric telegraph. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric conduction, electromagnetic induction and optical signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from Heinrich Hertz, who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect electromagnetic radiation, based on the work of James Clerk Maxwell. At the time, this radiation was commonly called Hertzian waves, and is now generally referred to as radio waves.There was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method. Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a line of sight path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling. Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist Oliver Lodge and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi. Righi's article renewed Marconi's interest in developing a wireless telegraphy system based on radio waves, a line of inquiry that Marconi noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing.  Developing radio telegraphy  At the age of 20, Marconi began to conduct experiments in radio waves, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio , Italy, with the help of his butler, Mignani. Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a coherer, an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist douard Branly and used in Lodge's experiments, that changed resistance when exposed to radio waves. In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning. Late one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench. Supported by his father, Marconi continued to read through the literature and picked up on the ideas of physicists who were experimenting with radio waves. He developed devices, such as portable transmitters and receiver systems, that could work over long distances, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system. Marconi came up with a functional system with many components: A relatively simple oscillator or spark producing radio transmitter; A wire or metal sheet capacity area suspended at a height above the ground; A coherer receiver, which was a modification of douard Branly's original device with refinements to increase sensitivity and reliability; A telegraph key to operate the transmitter to send short and long pulses, corresponding to the dots and dashes of Morse code; and A telegraph register activated by the coherer which recorded the received Morse code dots and dashes onto a roll of paper tape.In the summer of 1895, Marconi moved his experiments outdoors on his father's estate in Bologna. He tried different arrangements and shapes of antenna but even with improvements he was able to transmit signals only up to one half mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves.  Transmission breakthrough  A breakthrough came in the summer of 1895, when Marconi found that much greater range could be achieved after he raised the height of his antenna and, borrowing from a technique used in wired telegraphy, grounded his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements, the system was capable of transmitting signals up to 2 miles and over hills. The monopole antenna reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the dipole antennas used by Hertz, and radiated vertically polarized radio waves which could travel longer distances. By this point, he concluded that a device could become capable of spanning greater distances, with additional funding and research, and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering complete, commercially successful radio transmission system.Marconi applied to the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs, then under the direction of Maggiorino Ferraris, explaining his wireless telegraph machine and asking for funding, but never received a response. An apocryphal tale claims that the minister wrote to the Longara on the document, referring to the insane asylum on Via della Lungara in Rome, but the letter was never found.In 1896, Marconi spoke with his family friend Carlo Gardini, Honorary Consul at the United States Consulate in Bologna, about leaving Italy to go to Great Britain. Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, Annibale Ferrero, explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to Britain, where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use. Finding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. Marconi arrived at Dover, and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of William Preece, the Chief Electrical Engineer of the General Post Office . During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor , which would become the first patent for a radio wave based communication system.  Demonstrations and achievements  Marconi made the first demonstration of his system for the British government in July 1896. A further series of demonstrations for the British followed, and, by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about 6 kilometres across Salisbury Plain. On 13 May 1897, Marconi sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea a message was transmitted over the Bristol Channel from Flat Holm Island to Lavernock Point near Cardiff, a distance of 6 kilometres . The message read, Are you ready . The transmitting equipment was almost immediately relocated to Brean Down Fort on the Somerset coast, stretching the range to 16 kilometres . Impressed by these and other demonstrations, Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures: Telegraphy without Wires , at the Toynbee Hall on 11 December 1896; and Signalling through Space without Wires , given to the Royal Institution on 4 June 1897.Numerous additional demonstrations followed, and Marconi began to receive international attention. In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at La Spezia, in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for Lloyd's between The Marine Hotel in Ballycastle and Rathlin Island, both in County Antrim in Ulster, Ireland, was conducted on 6 July 1898 by George Kemp and Edward Edwin Glanville. A transmission across the English channel was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from Wimereux, France to South Foreland Lighthouse, England. Marconi set up an experimental base at the Haven Hotel, Sandbanks, Poole Harbour, Dorset, where he erected a 100 foot high mast. He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, and his steam yacht, the Elettra, was often moored on Brownsea or at The Haven Hotel. Marconi purchased the vessel after the Great War and converted it to a seaborne laboratory from where he conducted many of his experiments. Among the Elettra's crew was Adelmo Landini, his personal radio operator, who was also an inventor.In December 1898, the British lightship service authorised the establishment of wireless communication between the South Foreland lighthouse at Dover and the East Goodwin lightship, twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent the first wireless distress signal, a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel Elbe which had run aground on Goodwin Sands. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the Ramsgate lifeboat. In the autumn of 1899, his first demonstration in the United States took place. Marconi had sailed to the U.S. at the invitation of The New York Herald newspaper to cover the America's Cup international yacht races off Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The transmission was done aboard the SS Ponce, a passenger ship of the Porto Rico Line. Marconi left for England on 8 November 1899 on the American Line's SS Saint Paul, and he and his assistants installed wireless equipment aboard during the voyage. Prior to this voyage the Second Boer War had begun, and Marconi's wireless would bring news of the conflict to passengers at the request of some of the officials of the American line. On 15 November the SS Saint Paul became the first ocean liner to report her imminent return to Great Britain by wireless when Marconi's Royal Needles Hotel radio station contacted her 66 nautical miles off the English coast. The first Transatlantic Times, a newspaper containing wireless transmission news from the Needles Station at the Isle of Wight, was published onboard the SS Saint Paul prior to its arrival.  Transatlantic transmissions  At the turn of the 20th century, Marconi began investigating a means to signal across the Atlantic to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall, England, and Clifden in Connemara, County Galway, Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at Signal Hill in St. John's, Newfoundland , on 12 December 1901, using a 500 foot kite supported antenna for reception signals transmitted by the company's new high power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles . It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was and continues to be considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters . The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter S. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two stage circuit. Feeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS Philadelphia sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced coherer tape reception up to 1,550 miles , and audio reception up to 2,100 miles . The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for medium wave and longwave transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about 700 miles , less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres , despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line of sight distances. On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near South Wellfleet, Massachusetts, that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President Theodore Roosevelt to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.Marconi began to build high powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between Clifden, Ireland, and Glace Bay, but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication to others.  Titanic  The role played by Marconi Co. wireless in maritime rescues raised public awareness of the value of radio and brought fame to Marconi, particularly the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912 and the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915.RMS Titanic radio operators Jack Phillips and Harold Bride were not employed by the White Star Line but by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company. After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the RMS Carpathia of the Cunard Line. The Carpathia took a total of 17 minutes to both receive and decode the SOS signal sent by the Titanic. There was a distance of 58 miles between the two ships. When Carpathia docked in New York, Marconi went aboard with a reporter from The New York Times to talk with Bride, the surviving operator. After this incident, Marconi gained popularity and became more recognised for his contributions to the field of radio and wireless technology.On 18 June 1912, Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry into the loss of the Titanic regarding the marine telegraphy's functions and the procedures for emergencies at sea. Britain's Postmaster General summed up, referring to the Titanic disaster: Those who have been saved, have been saved through one man, Mr. Marconi ... and his marvellous invention. Marconi was offered free passage on the Titanic before she sank, but had taken the Lusitania three days earlier. As his daughter Degna later explained, he had paperwork to do and preferred the public stenographer aboard that vessel.  Continuing work  Over the years, the Marconi companies gained a reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube . The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication. In 1924, the Marconi Company co established the Unione Radiofonica Italiana .  Later years  In 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in the UK. During World War I, Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service. He attained the rank of lieutenant in the Italian Royal Army and of commander in the Regia Marina. In 1929, he was made a marquess by King Victor Emmanuel III. While helping to develop microwave technology, the Marchese Marconi suffered nine heart attacks in the span of three years preceding his death. Marconi died in Rome on 20 July 1937 at age 63, following the ninth, fatal, heart attack, and Italy held a state funeral for him. As a tribute, shops on the street where he lived were Closed for national mourning . In addition, at 6 pm the next day, the time designated for the funeral, transmitters around the world observed two minutes of silence in his honour. The British Post Office also sent a message requesting that all broadcasting ships honour Marconi with two minutes of broadcasting silence. His remains are housed in the Mausoleum of Guglielmo Marconi in the grounds of Villa Griffone at Sasso Marconi, Emilia Romagna, which assumed that name in his honour in 1938.In 1943, Marconi's elegant sailing yacht, the Elettra, was commandeered and refitted as a warship by the German Navy. She was sunk by the RAF on 22 January 1944. After the war, the Italian Government tried to retrieve the wreckage, to rebuild the boat, and the wreckage was removed to Italy. Eventually, the idea was abandoned, and the wreckage was cut into pieces which were distributed amongst Italian museums. In 1943, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a decision on Marconi's radio patents restoring some of the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone Stone, and Nikola Tesla. The decision was not about Marconi's original radio patents and the court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents was questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents. There are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the United States government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring the non Marconi prior patent.  Personal life  Marconi was a friend of Charles van Raalte and his wife Florence, the owners of Brownsea Island; and of Margherita, their daughter, and in 1904 he met her Irish friend, The Hon. Beatrice O'Brien , a daughter of The 14th Baron Inchiquin. On 16 March 1905, Beatrice O'Brien and Marconi were married, and spent their honeymoon on Brownsea Island. They had three daughters, Degna , Gioia , and Lucia , and a son, Giulio, 2nd Marchese Marconi . In 1913, the Marconi family returned to Italy and became part of Rome society. Beatrice served as a lady in waiting to Queen Elena. At Marconi's request, his marriage to Beatrice was annulled on 27 April 1927, so he could remarry. Marconi and Beatrice had divorced on 12 February 1924 in the free city of Fiume . On 12 June 1927 Marconi went on to marry Maria Cristina Bezzi Scali , the only daughter of Francesco, Count Bezzi Scali. To do this he had to be confirmed in the Catholic faith and became a devout member of the Church. He was baptised Catholic but had been brought up as a member of the Anglican Church. On 12 June 1927, Marconi married Maria Cristina in a civil service, with a religious ceremony performed on 15 June. Marconi was 53 years old and Maria Cristina was 26. They had one daughter, Maria Elettra Elena Anna , who married Prince Carlo Giovannelli in 1966; they later divorced. For unexplained reasons, Marconi left his entire fortune to his second wife and their only child, and nothing to the children of his first marriage.Marconi wanted to personally introduce in 1931 the first radio broadcast of a Pope, Pius XI, and did announce at the microphone: With the help of God, who places so many mysterious forces of nature at man's disposal, I have been able to prepare this instrument which will give to the faithful of the entire world the joy of listening to the voice of the Holy Father .  Fascism  Marconi joined the National Fascist Party in 1923. In 1930, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini appointed him President of the Royal Academy of Italy, which made Marconi a member of the Fascist Grand Council. Marconi was an apologist for fascist ideology and actions such as the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in the Second Italo Abyssinian War.In his lecture he stated: I reclaim the honour of being the first fascist in the field of radiotelegraphy, the first who acknowledged the utility of joining the electric rays in a bundle, as Mussolini was the first in the political field who acknowledged the necessity of merging all the healthy energies of the country into a bundle, for the greater greatness of Italy .In 2002 researcher Annalisa Capristo found documents in the archives of Rome which showed that during his time as the President of the Royal Academy of Italy, Marconi had marked by hand Jewish applicants' records with an E , where in the Italian language word for Jew is Ebreo . Not one Jew was allowed to join during Marconi's tenure as President from 1930, three years before Adolf Hitler took power in Germany and eight years before Benito Mussolini's race laws brought his regime's anti semitism into the open. Following publication of Capristo's article The Exclusion of Jews From the Academy of Italy published in the Israel Monthly Review, historians were divided over whether the discrimination was the personal initiative of a scientist who considered Jews inferior or whether it was the action of a man too weak to oppose the regime's edicts.  Legacy and honours   Archives  A large collection of Marconi artefacts was held by The General Electric Company, plc of the United Kingdom which later renamed itself Marconi plc and Marconi Corporation plc. In December 2004 the extensive Marconi Collection, held at the former Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, Chelmsford, Essex UK was donated to the nation by the Company via the University of Oxford. This consisted of the BAFTA award winning MarconiCalling website, some 250 physical artefacts and the massive ephemera collection of papers, books, patents and many other items. The artefacts are now held by The Museum of the History of Science and the ephemera Archives by the nearby Bodleian Library. Following three years' work at the Bodleian, an Online Catalogue to the Marconi Archives was released in November 2008.

In 1903, Marconi also received the freedom of the City of Rome. In 1909, Marconi shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun for their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy . In 1914, Marconi was named senator by the king of Italy Vittorio Emanuele III In 1918, he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal. In 1920, he was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor, now the IEEE Medal of Honor. In 1931, he was awarded the John Scott Medal by the Franklin Institute and the City Council of Philadelphia. In 1934, he was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal. In 1974, Italy marked the birth centennial of Marconi with a circulating commemorative Lire 100 coin. In 1975, Marconi was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1978, Marconi was inducted into the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame. In 1988, the Radio Hall of Fame inducted Marconi as a Pioneer . In 1990, the Bank of Italy issued a Lire 2,000 banknote featuring his portrait on the front and on the back his accomplishments. In 2001, Great Britain released a commemorative 2 coin celebrating the 100th anniversary of Marconi's first wireless communication. Marconi's early experiments in wireless telegraphy were the subject of two IEEE Milestones; one in Switzerland in 2003 and most recently in Italy in 2011. In 2009, Italy issued a commemorative silver 10 Euro coin honouring the centennial of Marconi's Nobel Prize. In 2009, he was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The Dutch radio academy bestows the Marconi Awards annually for outstanding radio programmes, presenters and stations. The National Association of Broadcasters bestows the annual NAB Marconi Radio Awards also for outstanding radio programmes and stations.  Tributes  A funerary monument to the effigy of Marconi can be seen in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, but his remains are in the Mausoleum of Guglielmo Marconi in Sasso Marconi, Italy. His former villa, adjacent to the mausoleum is the Marconi Museum with much of his equipment. A Guglielmo Marconi sculpture by Attilio Piccirilli stands in Washington, D.C. A granite obelisk stands on the cliff top near the site of Marconi's Marconi's Poldhu Wireless Station in Cornwall, commemorating the first transatlantic transmission.

North America  Canada The Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada , of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was created in 1903 by Guglielmo Marconi. In 1925 the company was renamed to the 'Canadian Marconi Company', which was acquired by English Electric in 1953. The company name changed again to CMC Electronics Inc. in 2001. In 2002, the company historical radio business was sold to Ultra Electronics to become Ultra Electronics TCS Inc., now doing business as Ultra Communications. Both CMC Electronics and Ultra Communications are still located in Montreal. The Marconi National Historic Sites of Canada was created by Parks Canada as a tribute to Marconi's vision in the development of radio telecommunications. The first official wireless message was sent from this location by the Atlantic Ocean to England in 1902. The museum site is located in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, at Table Head on Timmerman Street.

            "text": "Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay , all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetism and nuclear force. A fourth type of common decay is electron capture, in which an unstable nucleus captures an inner electron from one of the electron shells. The loss of that electron from the shell results in a cascade of electrons dropping down to that lower shell, resulting in emission of discrete X rays from the transitions. A common example is iodine 125 commonly used in medical settings. Radioactive decay is a stochastic process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed. However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half life. The half lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe. The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide , and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons . When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created. Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle . Beta decay occurs in two ways; In gamma decay a radioactive nucleus first decays by the emission of an alpha or beta particle. The daughter nucleus that results is usually left in an excited state and it can decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon. In neutron emission, extremely neutron rich nuclei, formed due to other types of decay or after many successive neutron captures, occasionally lose energy by way of neutron emission, resulting in a change from one isotope to another of the same element. In electron capture, the nucleus may capture an orbiting electron, causing a proton to convert into a neutron in a process called electron capture. A neutrino and a gamma ray are subsequently emitted. In cluster decay and nuclear fission, a nucleus heavier than an alpha particle is emitted.By contrast, there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a nuclear transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in a process called gamma decay, or that energy may be lost when the nucleus interacts with an orbital electron causing its ejection from the atom, in a process called internal conversion. Another type of radioactive decay results in products that vary, appearing as two or more fragments of the original nucleus with a range of possible masses. This decay, called spontaneous fission, happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two smaller daughter nuclei, and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles from those products. In contrast, decay products from a nucleus with spin may be distributed non isotropically with respect to that spin direction. Either because of an external influence such as an electromagnetic field, or because the nucleus was produced in a dynamic process that constrained the direction of its spin, the anisotropy may be detectable. Such a parent process could be a previous decay, or a nuclear reaction.For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides, see radionuclide. There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 34 radionuclides that date before the time of formation of the Solar System. These 34 are known as primordial nuclides. Well known examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long lived radioisotopes, such as potassium 40. Another 50 or so shorter lived radionuclides found on Earth such as radium 226 and radon 222, are the products of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides, or are the product of ongoing cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon 14 from nitrogen 14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, resulting in 650 of these with half lives of over an hour, and several thousand more with even shorter half lives.  History of discovery  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by scientists Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie, while working with phosphorescent materials. These materials glow in the dark after exposure to light, and he suspected that the glow produced in cathode ray tubes by X rays might be associated with phosphorescence. Becquerel wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent salts on it. All results were negative until he used uranium salts. The uranium salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite of the plate being wrapped in black paper. These radiations were given the name Becquerel Rays . It soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do with phosphorescence, as the blackening was also produced by non phosphorescent salts of uranium and by metallic uranium. It became clear from these experiments that there was a form of invisible radiation that could pass through paper and was causing the plate to react as if exposed to light. At first, it seemed as though the new radiation was similar to the then recently discovered X rays. Further research by Becquerel, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Villard, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and others showed that this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Rutherford was the first to realize that all such elements decay in accordance with the same mathematical exponential formula. Rutherford and his student Frederick Soddy were the first to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one element to another. Subsequently, the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was formulated to describe the products of alpha and beta decay.The early researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements, besides uranium, have radioactive isotopes. A systematic search for the total radioactivity in uranium ores also guided Pierre and Marie Curie to isolate two new elements: polonium and radium. Except for the radioactivity of radium, the chemical similarity of radium to barium made these two elements difficult to distinguish. Marie and Pierre Curie's study of radioactivity is an important factor in science and medicine. After their research on Becquerel's rays led them to the discovery of both radium and polonium, they coined the term radioactivity to define the emission of ionizing radiation by some heavy elements. Their research on the penetrating rays in uranium and the discovery of radium launched an era of using radium for the treatment of cancer. Their exploration of radium could be seen as the first peaceful use of nuclear energy and the start of modern nuclear medicine.  Early health dangers  The dangers of ionizing radiation due to radioactivity and X rays were not immediately recognized.  X rays  The discovery of X rays by Wilhelm R ntgen in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of Vanderbilt University performed an experiment involving X raying Dudley's head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, of his suffering severe hand and chest burns in an X ray demonstration, was the first of many other reports in Electrical Review.Other experimenters, including Elihu Thomson and Nikola Tesla, also reported burns. Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects, including ultraviolet rays and ozone, were sometimes blamed for the damage, and many physicians still claimed that there were no effects from X ray exposure at all.Despite this, there were some early systematic hazard investigations, and as early as 1902 William Herbert Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in the careless use of X rays were not being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time, Rollins had proved that X rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a foetus. He also stressed that animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X light and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of X rays.  Radioactive substances  However, the biological effects of radiation due to radioactive substances were less easy to gauge. This gave the opportunity for many physicians and corporations to market radioactive substances as patent medicines. Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that radium is dangerous in untrained hands. Curie later died from aplastic anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market .  Radiation protection  Only a year after R ntgen's discovery of X rays, the American engineer Wolfram Fuchs gave what is probably the first protection advice, but it was not until 1925 that the first International Congress of Radiology was held and considered establishing international protection standards. The effects of radiation on genes, including the effect of cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927, Hermann Joseph Muller published research showing genetic effects and, in 1946, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his findings. The second ICR was held in Stockholm in 1928 and proposed the adoption of the r ntgen unit, and the International X ray and Radium Protection Committee was formed. Rolf Sievert was named Chairman, but a driving force was George Kaye of the British National Physical Laboratory. The committee met in 1931, 1934, and 1937. After World War II, the increased range and quantity of radioactive substances being handled as a result of military and civil nuclear programs led to large groups of occupational workers and the public being potentially exposed to harmful levels of ionising radiation. This was considered at the first post war ICR convened in London in 1950, when the present International Commission on Radiological Protection was born. Since then the ICRP has developed the present international system of radiation protection, covering all aspects of radiation hazards. In 2020, Hauptmann and other 15 international researchers of eight nations, among which: Institutes of Biostatistics, Registry Research, Centers of Cancer Epidemiology, Radiation Epidemiology, and then also U.S. National Cancer Institute , International Agency for Research on Cancer and Radiation Effects Research Foundation of Hiroshima studied definitively through meta analysis the damage resulting from the low doses that have afflicted the populations of survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and also in numerous accidents of nuclear plants that have occurred in the world. These scientists reported, in JNCI Monographs: Epidemiological Studies of Low Dose Ionizing Radiation and Cancer Risk, that the new epidemiological studies directly support excess cancer risks from low dose ionizing radiation. In 2021, Italian researcher Venturi reported the first correlations between radio caesium and pancreatic cancer with the role of caesium in biology and in pancreatitis and in diabetes of pancreatic origin.  Units  The International System of Units unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel , named in honor of the scientist Henri Becquerel. One Bq is defined as one transformation per second. An older unit of radioactivity is the curie, Ci, which was originally defined as the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium . Today, the curie is defined as 3.7 1010 disintegrations per second, so that 1 curie  3.7 1010 Bq. For radiological protection purposes, although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the unit curie alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that its use for public health ... purposes be phased out by 31 December 1985.The effects of ionizing radiation are often measured in units of gray for mechanical or sievert for damage to tissue.  Types  Early researchers found that an electric or magnetic field could split radioactive emissions into three types of beams. The rays were given the names alpha, beta, and gamma, in increasing order of their ability to penetrate matter. Alpha decay is observed only in heavier elements of atomic number 52 and greater, with the exception of beryllium 8 . The other two types of decay are observed in all the elements. Lead, atomic number 82, is the heaviest element to have any isotopes stable to radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is seen in all isotopes of all elements of atomic number 83 or greater. Bismuth 209, however, is only very slightly radioactive, with a half life greater than the age of the universe; radioisotopes with extremely long half lives are considered effectively stable for practical purposes. In analysing the nature of the decay products, it was obvious from the direction of the electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that alpha particles carried a positive charge, beta particles carried a negative charge, and gamma rays were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles. Passing alpha particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured particles, and ultimately proved that alpha particles are helium nuclei. Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting from decay and cathode rays, were high speed electrons. Likewise, gamma radiation and X rays were found to be high energy electromagnetic radiation. The relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined: For example, gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other types of decay, and occurred at about the same time, or afterwards. Gamma decay as a separate phenomenon, with its own half life , was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers, which were in turn created from other types of decay. Although alpha, beta, and gamma radiations were most commonly found, other types of emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after the discovery of the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons , along with neutrinos . In a more common analogous process, called electron capture, some proton rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons instead of emitting positrons, and subsequently, these nuclides emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excited nucleus . These types of decay involve the nuclear capture of electrons or emission of electrons or positrons, and thus acts to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given total number of nucleons. This consequently produces a more stable nucleus. A hypothetical process of positron capture, analogous to electron capture, is theoretically possible in antimatter atoms, but has not been observed, as complex antimatter atoms beyond antihelium are not experimentally available. Such a decay would require antimatter atoms at least as complex as beryllium 7, which is the lightest known isotope of normal matter to undergo decay by electron capture.Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico Fermi realized that certain rare beta decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as an additional decay particle, so called beta delayed neutron emission. Neutron emission usually happens from nuclei that are in an excited state, such as the excited 17O produced from the beta decay of 17N. The neutron emission process itself is controlled by the nuclear force and therefore is extremely fast, sometimes referred to as nearly instantaneous . Isolated proton emission was eventually observed in some elements. It was also found that some heavy elements may undergo spontaneous fission into products that vary in composition. In a phenomenon called cluster decay, specific combinations of neutrons and protons other than alpha particles were found to be spontaneously emitted from atoms. Other types of radioactive decay were found to emit previously seen particles but via different mechanisms. An example is internal conversion, which results in an initial electron emission, and then often further characteristic X rays and Auger electrons emissions, although the internal conversion process involves neither beta nor gamma decay. A neutrino is not emitted, and none of the electron and photon emitted originate in the nucleus, even though the energy to emit all of them does originate there. Internal conversion decay, like isomeric transition gamma decay and neutron emission, involves the release of energy by an excited nuclide, without the transmutation of one element into another. Rare events that involve a combination of two beta decay type events happening simultaneously are known . Any decay process that does not violate the conservation of energy or momentum laws is permitted to happen, although not all have been detected. An interesting example discussed in a final section, is bound state beta decay of rhenium 187. In this process, the beta electron decay of the parent nuclide is not accompanied by beta electron emission, because the beta particle has been captured into the K shell of the emitting atom. An antineutrino is emitted, as in all negative beta decays. Radionuclides can undergo a number of different reactions. These are summarized in the following table. A nucleus with mass number A and atomic number Z is represented as . The column Daughter nucleus indicates the difference between the new nucleus and the original nucleus. Thus, means that the mass number is one less than before, but the atomic number is the same as before. If energy circumstances are favorable, a given radionuclide may undergo many competing types of decay, with some atoms decaying by one route, and others decaying by another. An example is copper 64, which has 29 protons, and 35 neutrons, which decays with a half life of 12.7004 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay to the other particle, which has opposite isospin. This particular nuclide is more likely to decay through beta plus decay  than through electron capture . The excited energy states resulting from these decays which fail to end in a ground energy state, also produce later internal conversion and gamma decay in almost 0.5 of the time. More common in heavy nuclides is competition between alpha and beta decay. The daughter nuclides will then normally decay through beta or alpha, respectively, to end up in the same place. Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy has escaped in some way. Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears according to the formula E mc2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles . If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass. Decay energy, therefore, remains associated with a certain measure of the mass of the decay system, called invariant mass, which does not change during the decay, even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles. The energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles, and, later, the thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to the invariant mass of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay, the system mass and system invariant mass is conserved throughout any decay process. This is a restatement of the equivalent laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass.  List of decay modes   Rates The decay rate, or activity, of a radioactive substance is characterized by the following time independent parameters: The half life, t1 2, is the time taken for the activity of a given amount of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value. The decay constant, lambda , the reciprocal of the mean lifetime , sometimes referred to as simply decay rate. The mean lifetime, tau , the average lifetime of a radioactive particle before decay.Although these are constants, they are associated with the statistical behavior of populations of atoms. In consequence, predictions using these constants are less accurate for minuscule samples of atoms. In principle a half life, a third life, or even a life, can be used in exactly the same way as half life; but the mean life and half life t1 2 have been adopted as standard times associated with exponential decay. Those parameters can be related to the following time dependent parameters: Total activity, A, is the number of decays per unit time of a radioactive sample. Number of particles, N, is the total number of particles in the sample. Specific activity, a, is the number of decays per unit time per amount of substance of the sample at time set to zero . Amount of substance can be the mass, volume or moles of the initial sample.These are related as follows:                         t          1                      2                                              ln                                             ln                            A                                               d            N                       d            t                            N                       S          A                  a          0                                                        d            N                       d            t                                                       t           0                           N          0                          displaystyle begin aligned t 1 2  frac ln lambda  tau ln 2pt A  frac mathrm d N mathrm d t lambda N 2pt S A a 0  frac mathrm d N mathrm d t bigg  t 0 lambda N 0 end aligned  where N0 is the initial amount of active substance substance that has the same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed.  Mathematics   Universal law  The mathematics of radioactive decay depend on a key assumption that a nucleus of a radionuclide has no memory or way of translating its history into its present behavior. A nucleus does not age with the passage of time. Thus, the probability of its breaking down does not increase with time but stays constant, no matter how long the nucleus has existed. This constant probability may differ greatly between one type of nucleus and another, leading to the many different observed decay rates. However, whatever the probability is, it does not change over time. This is in marked contrast to complex objects that do show aging, such as automobiles and humans. These aging systems do have a chance of breakdown per unit of time that increases from the moment they begin their existence. Aggregate processes, like the radioactive decay of a lump of atoms, for which the single event probability of realization is very small but in which the number of time slices is so large that there is nevertheless a reasonable rate of events, are modelled by the Poisson distribution, which is discrete. Radioactive decay and nuclear particle reactions are two examples of such aggregate processes. The mathematics of Poisson processes reduce to the law of exponential decay, which describes the statistical behaviour of a large number of nuclei, rather than one individual nucleus. In the following formalism, the number of nuclei or the nuclei population N, is of course a discrete variable but for any physical sample N is so large that it can be treated as a continuous variable. Differential calculus is used to model the behaviour of nuclear decay.  One decay process  Consider the case of a nuclide A that decays into another B by some process A B . The decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random in time so it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay. However, it is equally likely to decay at any instant in time. Therefore, given a sample of a particular radioisotope, the number of decay events dN expected to occur in a small interval of time dt is proportional to the number of atoms present N, that is                       d        N               d        t             N     displaystyle frac mathrm d N mathrm d t propto N Particular radionuclides decay at different rates, so each has its own decay constant . The expected decay dN N is proportional to an increment of time, dt: The negative sign indicates that N decreases as time increases, as the decay events follow one after another. The solution to this first order differential equation is the function:       N          N      0             e                    t          displaystyle N N 0 ,e  lambda t  where N0 is the value of N at time t 0, with the decay constant expressed as We have for all time t:         N      A             N      B             N      total             N      A    0        ,     displaystyle N A N B N text total N A0 , where Ntotal is the constant number of particles throughout the decay process, which is equal to the initial number of A nuclides since this is the initial substance. If the number of non decayed A nuclei is:         N      A             N      A    0          e             t          displaystyle N A N A0 e lambda t  then the number of nuclei of B is         N      B             N      A    0             N      A             N      A    0             N      A    0          e             t             N      A    0               .     displaystyle N B N A0 N A N A0 N A0 e lambda t N A0 left . The number of decays observed over a given interval obeys Poisson statistics. If the average number of decays is N , the probability of a given number of decays N is       P                     N                  N            exp                   N    !           .     displaystyle P frac langle N rangle N exp N! .   Chain decay processes    Chain of two decays  Now consider the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclide A decaying into another B by one process, then B decaying into another C by a second process, i.e. A B C. The previous equation cannot be applied to the decay chain, but can be generalized as follows. Since A decays into B, then B decays into C, the activity of A adds to the total number of B nuclides in the present sample, before those B nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the later sample. In other words, the number of second generation nuclei B increases as a result of the first generation nuclei decay of A, and decreases as a result of its own decay into the third generation nuclei C. The sum of these two terms gives the law for a decay chain for two nuclides:                     d            N         B                       d        t                         B          N      B                   A          N      A        .     displaystyle frac mathrm d N B mathrm d t  lambda B N B lambda A N A . The rate of change of NB, that is dNB dt, is related to the changes in the amounts of A and B, NB can increase as B is produced from A and decrease as B produces C. Re writing using the previous results: The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides, i.e. NA is the number of nuclides of type A; NA0 is the initial number of nuclides of type A; A is the decay constant for A and similarly for nuclide B. Solving this equation for NB gives:         N      B                        N         A     0                          A                                B                              A                          .     displaystyle N B frac N A0 lambda A lambda B lambda A left . In the case where B is a stable nuclide , this equation reduces to the previous solution:         lim                  B              0                                   N           A      0                                A                                        B                                     A                                                           N         A     0                          A                   0                      A                                N      A    0               ,     displaystyle lim lambda B rightarrow 0 left frac N A0 lambda A lambda B lambda A left right frac N A0 lambda A 0 lambda A left N A0 left , as shown above for one decay. The solution can be found by the integration factor method, where the integrating factor is e Bt. This case is perhaps the most useful since it can derive both the one decay equation and the equation for multi decay chains more directly.   Chain of any number of decays  For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain, i.e. A1 A2  Ai  AD, where D is the number of decays and i is a dummy index , each nuclide population can be found in terms of the previous population. In this case N2 0, N3 0, ..., ND 0. Using the above result in a recursive form:                     d            N         j                       d        t                         j          N      j                   j       1          N          0          e                      j         1           t        .     displaystyle frac mathrm d N j mathrm d t  lambda j N j lambda j 1 N 0 e lambda j 1 t . The general solution to the recursive problem is given by Bateman's equations:  Alternative modes  In all of the above examples, the initial nuclide decays into just one product. Consider the case of one initial nuclide that can decay into either of two products, that is A B and A C in parallel. For example, in a sample of potassium 40, 89.3 of the nuclei decay to calcium 40 and 10.7 to argon 40. We have for all time t:       N        N      A             N      B             N      C          displaystyle N N A N B N C  which is constant, since the total number of nuclides remains constant. Differentiating with respect to time:                                           d                  N             A                                   d            t                                                                                 N          A                                       N          A                                        displaystyle begin aligned frac mathrm d N A mathrm d t  left  lambda N A N A left end aligned  defining the total decay constant in terms of the sum of partial decay constants B and C:                     B                   C        .     displaystyle lambda lambda B lambda C . Solving this equation for NA:         N      A             N      A    0          e             t        .     displaystyle N A N A0 e lambda t . where NA0 is the initial number of nuclide A. When measuring the production of one nuclide, one can only observe the total decay constant . The decay constants B and C determine the probability for the decay to result in products B or C as follows:         N      B                            B                     N      A    0               ,     displaystyle N B frac lambda B lambda N A0 left ,          N      C                            C                     N      A    0               .     displaystyle N C frac lambda C lambda N A0 left . because the fraction B of nuclei decay into B while the fraction C of nuclei decay into C.  Corollaries of laws  The above equations can also be written using quantities related to the number of nuclide particles N in a sample; The activity: A N. The amount of substance: n N NA. The mass: m Mn MN NA.where NA 6.02214076 1023 mol 1 is the Avogadro constant, M is the molar mass of the substance in kg mol, and the amount of the substance n is in moles.  Decay timing: definitions and relations   Time constant and mean life  For the one decay solution A B:       N        N      0             e                    t             N      0             e          t                      ,          displaystyle N N 0 ,e  lambda t N 0 ,e t tau , , ! the equation indicates that the decay constant has units of t 1, and can thus also be represented as 1 , where is a characteristic time of the process called the time constant. In a radioactive decay process, this time constant is also the mean lifetime for decaying atoms. Each atom lives for a finite amount of time before it decays, and it may be shown that this mean lifetime is the arithmetic mean of all the atoms' lifetimes, and that it is , which again is related to the decay constant as follows:                  1           .     displaystyle tau frac 1 lambda . This form is also true for two decay processes simultaneously A B C, inserting the equivalent values of decay constants                     B                   C            displaystyle lambda lambda B lambda C , into the decay solution leads to:             1                            B                   C                1                B                       1                C                   displaystyle frac 1 tau  lambda lambda B lambda C frac 1 tau B  frac 1 tau C ,   Half life  A more commonly used parameter is the half life T1 2. Given a sample of a particular radionuclide, the half life is the time taken for half the radionuclide's atoms to decay. For the case of one decay nuclear reactions:       N        N      0             e                    t             N      0             e          t                      ,          displaystyle N N 0 ,e  lambda t N 0 ,e t tau , , ! the half life is related to the decay constant as follows: set N N0 2 and t T1 2 to obtain         t      1              2                    ln        2                   ln     2.     displaystyle t 1 2 frac ln 2 lambda  tau ln 2. This relationship between the half life and the decay constant shows that highly radioactive substances are quickly spent, while those that radiate weakly endure longer. Half lives of known radionuclides vary by almost 54 orders of magnitude, from more than 2.25 1024 years for the very nearly stable nuclide 128Te, to 8.6 10 23 seconds for the highly unstable nuclide 5H.The factor of ln in the above relations results from the fact that the concept of half life is merely a way of selecting a different base other than the natural base e for the lifetime expression. The time constant is the e 1 life, the time until only 1 e remains, about 36.8 , rather than the 50 in the half life of a radionuclide. Thus, is longer than t1 2. The following equation can be shown to be valid:       N          N      0             e          t                           N      0             2          t                  t        1                  2               .          displaystyle N N 0 ,e t tau N 0 ,2 t t 1 2 . , ! Since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability, each process could as easily be described with a different constant time period that gave its life or life , and so on. Thus, the choice of and t1 2 for marker times, are only for convenience, and from convention. They reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as they show that the same proportion of a given radioactive substance will decay, during any time period that one chooses. Mathematically, the nth life for the above situation would be found in the same way as above by setting N N0 n, t T1 n and substituting into the decay solution to obtain         t      1              n                    ln        n                   ln     n   .     displaystyle t 1 n frac ln n lambda  tau ln n.   Example for carbon 14  Carbon 14 has a half life of 5700 years and a decay rate of 14 disintegrations per minute per gram of natural carbon. If an artifact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its present C, we can find the approximate age of the object using the above equation:       N        N      0             e          t                      ,     displaystyle N N 0 ,e t tau , where:                               N           N            0                                         4                  14         0.286     ,                                                       T            1                          2                      ln            2                       8267          years         ,                   t                                  ln                   N           N            0                             10356          years         .                 displaystyle begin aligned frac N N 0  4 14 approx 0.286, tau  frac T 1 2 ln 2 approx 8267 text years , t tau , ln frac N N 0 approx 10356 text years . end aligned   Changing rates The radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that change the electronic structure of the atom, which in turn affects the presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process. A small number of nuclides are affected. For example, chemical bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus. In 7Be, a difference of 0.9 has been observed between half lives in metallic and insulating environments. This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic orbitals, which are subject to electron capture in 7Be because they naturally penetrate into the nucleus. In 1992, Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy Ion Research group observed an accelerated decay of 163Dy66 . Although neutral 163Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized 163Dy66 undergoes decay into the K and L shells to 163Ho66 with a half life of 47 days.Rhenium 187 is another spectacular example. 187Re normally undergoes beta decay to 187Os with a half life of 41.6 109 years, but studies using fully ionised 187Re atoms have found that this can decrease to only 32.9 years. This is attributed to bound state decay of the fully ionised atom the electron is emitted into the K shell , which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low lying bound states are occupied. A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure, the chemical environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields. Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century, studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor , and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae , for example, strongly indicate that unperturbed decay rates have been constant as a function of time as well.Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak dependence on environmental factors. It has been suggested that measurements of decay rates of silicon 32, manganese 54, and radium 226 exhibit small seasonal variations . However, such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic errors, and a subsequent paper has found no evidence for such correlations in seven other isotopes , and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects. The decay of radon 222 was once reported to exhibit large 4 peak to peak seasonal variations , which were proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or the distance from the Sun, but detailed analysis of the experiment's design flaws, along with comparisons to other, much more stringent and systematically controlled, experiments refute this claim.  GSI anomaly  An unexpected series of experimental results for the rate of decay of heavy highly charged radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring has provoked theoretical activity in an effort to find a convincing explanation. The rates of weak decay of two radioactive species with half lives of about 40 s and 200 s are found to have a significant oscillatory modulation, with a period of about 7 s. The observed phenomenon is known as the GSI anomaly, as the storage ring is a facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. As the decay process produces an electron neutrino, some of the proposed explanations for the observed rate oscillation invoke neutrino properties. Initial ideas related to flavour oscillation met with skepticism. A more recent proposal involves mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates.  Theoretical basis The neutrons and protons that constitute nuclei, as well as other particles that approach close enough to them, are governed by several interactions. The nuclear force , not observed at the familiar macroscopic scale, is the most powerful force over subatomic distances. The electrostatic force is almost always significant, and, in the case of beta decay, the weak nuclear force is also involved. The combined effects of these forces produces a number of different phenomena in which energy may be released by rearrangement of particles in the nucleus, or else the change of one type of particle into others. These rearrangements and transformations may be hindered energetically so that they do not occur immediately. In certain cases, random quantum vacuum fluctuations are theorized to promote relaxation to a lower energy state in a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. Radioactive decay half life of nuclides has been measured over timescales of 54 orders of magnitude, from 8.6 10 23 seconds to 7.10 1031 seconds . The limits of these timescales are set by the sensitivity of instrumentation only, and there are no known natural limits to how brief or long a decay half life for radioactive decay of a radionuclide may be. The decay process, like all hindered energy transformations, may be analogized by a snowfield on a mountain. While friction between the ice crystals may be supporting the snow's weight, the system is inherently unstable with regard to a state of lower potential energy. A disturbance would thus facilitate the path to a state of greater entropy; the system will move towards the ground state, producing heat, and the total energy will be distributable over a larger number of quantum states thus resulting in an avalanche. The total energy does not change in this process, but, because of the second law of thermodynamics, avalanches have only been observed in one direction and that is toward the ground state the state with the largest number of ways in which the available energy could be distributed. Such a collapse requires a specific activation energy. For a snow avalanche, this energy comes as a disturbance from outside the system, although such disturbances can be arbitrarily small. In the case of an excited atomic nucleus decaying by gamma radiation in a spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation, the arbitrarily small disturbance comes from quantum vacuum fluctuations.A radioactive nucleus is unstable, and can, thus, spontaneously stabilize to a less excited system. The resulting transformation alters the structure of the nucleus and results in the emission of either a photon or a high velocity particle that has mass .  Occurrence and applications According to the Big Bang theory, stable isotopes of the lightest three elements were produced very shortly after the emergence of the universe, in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These lightest stable nuclides survive to today, but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the Big Bang have long since decayed. Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the Big Bang, and these first five elements do not have any long lived radioisotopes. Thus, all radioactive nuclei are, therefore, relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe, having formed later in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars , and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic particles. For example, carbon 14, a radioactive nuclide with a half life of only 5700 years, is constantly produced in Earth's upper atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen. Nuclides that are produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic nuclides, whether they themselves are stable or not. There exist stable radiogenic nuclides that were formed from short lived extinct radionuclides in the early Solar System. The extra presence of these stable radiogenic nuclides against the background of primordial stable nuclides can be inferred by various means. Radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic labeling, which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance through a complex system . A sample of the substance is synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms. The presence of the substance in one or another part of the system is determined by detecting the locations of decay events. On the premise that radioactive decay is truly random , it has been used in hardware random number generators. Because the process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time, it is also a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain materials. For geological materials, the radioisotopes and some of their decay products become trapped when a rock solidifies, and can then later be used to estimate the date of the solidification. These include checking the results of several simultaneous processes and their products against each other, within the same sample. In a similar fashion, and also subject to qualification, the rate of formation of carbon 14 in various eras, the date of formation of organic matter within a certain period related to the isotope's half life may be estimated, because the carbon 14 becomes trapped when the organic matter grows and incorporates the new carbon 14 from the air. Thereafter, the amount of carbon 14 in organic matter decreases according to decay processes that may also be independently cross checked by other means .  Szilard Chalmers effect  The Szilard Chalmers effect is the breaking of a chemical bond as a result of a kinetic energy imparted from radioactive decay. It operates by the absorption of neutrons by an atom and subsequent emission of gamma rays, often with significant amounts of kinetic energy. This kinetic energy, by Newton's third law, pushes back on the decaying atom, which causes it to move with enough speed to break a chemical bond. This effect can be used to separate isotopes by chemical means. The Szilard Chalmers effect was discovered in 1934 by Le Szil rd and Thomas A. Chalmers. They observed that after bombardment by neutrons, the breaking of a bond in liquid ethyl iodide allowed radioactive iodine to be removed.  Origins of radioactive nuclides  Radioactive primordial nuclides found in the Earth are residues from ancient supernova explosions that occurred before the formation of the Solar System. They are the fraction of radionuclides that survived from that time, through the formation of the primordial solar nebula, through planet accretion, and up to the present time. The naturally occurring short lived radiogenic radionuclides found in today's rocks, are the daughters of those radioactive primordial nuclides. Another minor source of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides, that are formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the Earth's atmosphere or crust. The decay of the radionuclides in rocks of the Earth's mantle and crust contribute significantly to Earth's internal heat budget.  Decay chains and multiple modes  The daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable . In this case, it too will decay, producing radiation. The resulting second daughter nuclide may also be radioactive. This can lead to a sequence of several decay events called a decay chain . Eventually, a stable nuclide is produced. Any decay daughters that are the result of an alpha decay will also result in helium atoms being created. An example is the natural decay chain of 238U: Uranium 238 decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 4.463 billion years to thorium 234 which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 24.107 days to protactinium 234m which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 1.159 minutes to uranium 234 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 245.5 thousand years to thorium 230 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 75.4 thousand years to radium 226 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 1.600 thousand years to radon 222 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 3.8215 days to polonium 218 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 3.097 minutes to lead 214 which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 27.06 minutes to bismuth 214 which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 19.9 minutes to polonium 214 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 163.47 microseconds to lead 210 which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 22.20 years to bismuth 210 which decays, through beta emission, with a half life of 5.012 days to polonium 210 which decays, through alpha emission, with a half life of 138.376 days to lead 206, which is a stable nuclide.Some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay. For example, 35.94 of bismuth 212 decays, through alpha emission, to thallium 208 while 64.06 of bismuth 212 decays, through beta emission, to polonium 212. Both thallium 208 and polonium 212 are radioactive daughter products of bismuth 212, and both decay directly to stable lead 208.

He covers the high points of the inventor's life through his designs used in the modern alternating current system, experimentation with high frequency current and wireless power transmission, wireless remote control, X ray imaging, and Tesla's death ray . Seifer goes on to cover Tesla's downfall, attributing it to Tesla's megalomaniacal, neurotic, self destructive tendencies, and Tesla's interactions with financier J. Pierpont Morgan.Seifer based his book largely on primary sourced documents including Tesla's writings and patents. Also including papers of Tesla's in the Tesla archives in Yugoslavia as well as manuscripts in the United States.

            "text": "Jakob P schl was an Austrian physicist and university teacher.  Biography After graduating from Gymnasium P schl studied philosophy for two years at the University of Vienna. From 1846 to 1851 he studied at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute. He obtained permission to teach in Realschulen in mathematics and physics. From 1851 onwards he worked as a teacher, first in Vienna and later in Brno. In 1855 P schl was appointed first professor for experimental and technical physics at the Joanneum in Graz. In 1871 72 he was rector of the university. P schl retired in 1887 and was succeeded by Albert von Ettingshausen. P schl passed away in his house located at Klosterwiesgasse 19 after a long period of suffering on 6 January 1907. He was buried at the Graz St. Peter cemetery.Jakob P schl married Magdalena, n e N mayer in 1870 in the Graz Parish Church. The P schls had five children, three of them being scientists and working at universities as well: Son Arnold was a professor of canon law and rector of the University of Graz, Theodor was a mathematician and engineer in Karlsruhe, and Viktor was a chemist and rector of the Handelshochschule Mannheim. Historic sources state that son Fritz P schl studied medicine and daughter Maria married Dr. Karl Schadelbauer, a spa physician, on 16 April 1901. The German Austrian classical philologist Viktor P schl was a grandson of Jakob P schl.  Work Jakob P schl is most known for his role as a university teacher. His most prominent student in Graz was Nikola Tesla, whose 1919 autobiography My Inventions mentions P schl's demonstration of a Gramme electric generator as an inspiration in his development of an Induction motor. P schl's role in Tesla's university education is documented by the local press as early as in 1892 1893 . P schl repeatedly donated scholarships and prizes which were together with other grants awarded during the annual celebration of the founding of the Joanneum on 26 November.

            "text": "Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria. Undercooked shellfish is a common source. Humans are the only known host for the bacteria. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. A rapid dipstick test is available but is not as accurate.Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E. coli. By 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration had approved a single dose, live, oral cholera vaccine called Vaxchora for adults aged 18 64 who are travelling to an area of active cholera transmission. It offers limited protection to young children. People who survive an episode of cholera have long lasting immunity for at least 3 years The primary treatment for affected individuals is oral rehydration salts , the replacement of fluids and electrolytes by using slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice based solutions are preferred. Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.Cholera continues to affect an estimated 3 5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800 130,000 deaths a year. The most recent of seven cholera pandemics and associated outbreaks, since the early 19th century, started about 1961. As of 2010, it is rare in high income countries. Children are mostly affected. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5 , given improved treatment, but may be as high as 50 without such access to treatment. Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit. In Europe, cholera was a term initially used to describe any kind of gastroenteritis, and was not used for this disease until the early 19th century. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology because of his insights about transmission via contaminated water.  Signs and symptoms  The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria. The diarrhea is frequently described as rice water in nature and may have a fishy odor. An untreated person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres of diarrhea a day. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals. If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100. Cholera has been nicknamed the blue death because a person's skin may turn bluish gray from extreme loss of fluids.Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion. Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.  Cause   Transmission  Cholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton.Transmission is usually through the fecal oral route of contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation. Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water. Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as Vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton.People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as rice water , contaminates water used by others. A single diarrheal event can cause a one million fold increase in numbers of V. cholerae in the environment. The source of the contamination is typically other people with cholera when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.V. cholerae also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus. Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of V. cholerae. Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment. This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of V. cholerae to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as 'viable but non culturable' or more conservatively 'active but non culturable' . One study indicates that the culturability of V. cholerae drops 90 within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.Both toxic and non toxic strains exist. Non toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a temperate bacteriophage.  Susceptibility  About 100 million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity . Children are also more susceptible, with two to four year olds having the highest rates of infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to suffer a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can undergo a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.The cystic fibrosis genetic mutation known as delta F508 in humans has been said to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation are more resistant to V. cholerae infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.  Mechanism  When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach. The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they must propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.The cholera toxin is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit , and five copies of the B subunit , connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP ribosylation factor 6 . Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into V. cholerae by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of V. cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTX . Microbiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the V. cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless treated properly.By inserting separate, successive sections of V. cholerae DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as E. coli that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which V. cholerae responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of V. cholerae virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the V. cholerae bacteria produce the TcpP TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine. Current research aims at discovering the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize the small intestine.  Genetic structure  Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of V. cholerae has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.  Antibiotic resistance  In many areas of the world, antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin. Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi drug resistant cases. New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in in vitro studies.  Diagnosis A rapid dipstick test is available to determine the presence of V. cholerae. In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance. In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment via hydration and over the counter hydration solutions can be started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis, especially where cholera is a common problem.Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. If V. cholerae serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.Infection with V. cholerae O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by V. cholerae O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.  Prevention  The World Health Organization recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera. They also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system. Governments can play a role in all of these areas.  Water, sanitation and hygiene  Although cholera may be life threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to their nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices, cholera is rare. For example, the last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910 1911. Cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to WASH infrastructure is still inadequate. Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted: Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with the feces of other people with cholera are essential. These should be sanitized by washing in hot water, using chlorine bleach if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents. Sewage and fecal sludge management: In cholera affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via human excreta. Provision of sanitation and hygiene is an important preventative measure. Open defecation, release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from pit latrines or septic tanks into the environment need to be prevented. In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of sewage treatment. Therefore, the implementation of dry toilets that do not contribute to water pollution, as they do not flush with water, may be an interesting alternative to flush toilets. Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to decontaminate the water for possible use. Water purification: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, chlorination, ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization , or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.Handwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.    Surveillance  Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable. For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.  Vaccination  Spanish physician Jaume Ferran i Clua developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease. However, his vaccine and inoculation was rather controversial and was rejected by his peers and several investigation commissions. Russian Jewish bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine successfully developed the first human cholera vaccine in July 1892. He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India.Persons who survive an episode of cholera have long lasting immunity for at least 3 years A number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available. The World Health Organization has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines : Dukoral, Sanchol, and Euvichol. Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52 during the first year after being given and 62 in the second year, with minimal side effects. It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries. The vaccine that the US Food and Drug Administration recommends, Vaxchora, is an oral attenuated live vaccine, that is effective for adults aged 18 64 as a single dose.One injectable vaccine was found to be effective for two to three years. The protective efficacy was 28 lower in children less than five years old. However, as of 2010, it has limited availability. Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination. The WHO recommends immunization of high risk groups, such as children and people with HIV, in countries where this disease is endemic. If people are immunized broadly, herd immunity results, with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment.WHO recommends that oral cholera vaccination be considered in areas where the disease is endemic , as part of the response to outbreaks, or in a humanitarian crisis during which the risk of cholera is high. Oral Cholera Vaccine has been recognized as an adjunct tool for prevention and control of cholera. The World Health Organization has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccines Dukoral , containing a non toxic B subunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against V. cholerae O1; and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technology ShanChol and Euvichol , which have bivalent O1 and O139 oral killed cholera vaccines. Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists.  Sari filtration  Developed for use in Bangladesh, the sari filter is a simple and cost effective appropriate technology method for reducing the contamination of drinking water. Used sari cloth is preferable but other types of used cloth can be used with some effect, though the effectiveness will vary significantly. Used cloth is more effective than new cloth, as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibers. Water collected in this way has a greatly reduced pathogen count though it will not necessarily be perfectly safe, it is an improvement for poor people with limited options. In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half. It involves folding a sari four to eight times. Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it. A nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.  Treatment  Continued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. The WHO recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause. A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.  Fluids  The most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed and volume of fluids required. In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy , which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer. Rice based solutions are preferred to glucose based ones due to greater efficiency. In severe cases with significant dehydration, intravenous rehydration may be necessary. Ringer's lactate is the preferred solution, often with added potassium. Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed. Ten percent of a person's body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours. This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success. Despite widespread beliefs, fruit juices and commercial fizzy drinks like cola are not ideal for rehydration of people with serious infections of the intestines, and their excessive sugar content may even harm water uptake.If commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1 2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.  Electrolytes  As there frequently is initially acidosis, the potassium level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred. As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced. This may be done by consuming foods high in potassium, like bananas or coconut water.  Antibiotics  Antibiotic treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms. Use of antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements. People will recover without them, however, if sufficient hydration is maintained. The WHO only recommends antibiotics in those with severe dehydration.Doxycycline is typically used first line, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics proven to be effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.Antibiotics improve outcomes in those who are both severely and not severely dehydrated. Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.  Zinc supplementation  In Bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and rehydration therapy as needed. It reduced the length of disease by eight hours and the amount of diarrhea stool by 10 . Supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world.  Prognosis If people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1 ; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50 60 .For certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within two hours of becoming ill.  Epidemiology Cholera affects an estimated 2.8 million people worldwide, and causes approximately 95,000 deaths a year as of 2015. This occurs mainly in the developing world.In the early 1980s, death rates are believed to have still been higher than three million a year. It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country. As of 2004, cholera remained both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world.Recent major outbreaks are the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and the 2016 2021 Yemen cholera outbreak. In October 2016, an outbreak of cholera began in war ravaged Yemen. WHO called it the worst cholera outbreak in the world . In 2019, 93 of the reported 923,037 cholera cases were from Yemen . Between September 2019 and September 2020, a global total of over 450,000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported; however, the accuracy of these numbers suffer from over reporting from countries that report suspected cases , as well as under reporting from countries that do not report official cases .Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, researchers still do not have a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread. Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir of infection, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera had disappeared from the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared toward the end of that century, beginning with a severe outbreak in Peru. Following the end of the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak, there have not been any cholera cases in the Americas since February 2019. As of August 2021 the disease is endemic in Africa and some areas of eastern and western Asia . Cholera is not endemic in Europe; all reported cases had a travel history to endemic areas.  History of outbreaks  The word cholera is from Greek:  kholera from  khol bile . Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries.References to cholera appear in the European literature as early as 1642, from the Dutch physician Jakob de Bondt's description in his De Medicina Indorum. But at the time, the word cholera was historically used by European physicians to refer to any gastrointestinal upset resulting in yellow diarrhea. De Bondt thus used a common word already in regular use to describe the new disease. This was a frequent practice of the time. It was not until the 1830s that the name for severe yellow diarrhea changed in English from cholera to cholera morbus to differentiate it from what was then known as Asiatic cholera , or that associated with origins in India and the East. Early outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of crowded, poor living conditions, as well as the presence of pools of still water, both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by travelers along trade routes to Russia in 1817, later to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world, . Seven cholera pandemics have occurred since the early 19th century; the first one did not reach the Americas. The seventh pandemic originated in Indonesia in 1961.The first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India, near Calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa. The movement of British Army and Navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic, since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the Indian Ocean, from Africa to Indonesia, and north to China and Japan.The second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected North America and Europe. Advancements in transportation and global trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers, meant that more people were carrying the disease more widely. The third pandemic erupted in 1846, persisted until 1860, extended to North Africa, and reached North and South America. It was introduced to North America at Quebec, Canada, via Irish immigrants from the Great Famine. In this pandemic, Brazil was affected for the first time. The fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875, spreading from India to Naples and Spain, and reaching the United States at New Orleans, Louisiana in 1873. It spread throughout the Mississippi River system on the continent. The fifth pandemic was from 1881 to 1896. It started in India and spread to Europe, Asia, and South America. The sixth pandemic ran from 1899 1923. These epidemics had a lower number of fatalities because physicians and researchers had a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics. Other areas, such as Germany in 1892 and Naples from 1910 to 1911, also suffered severe outbreaks. The seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed El Tor, which still persists in developing countries. This pandemic had initially subsided about 1975 and was thought to have ended, but, as noted, it has persisted. There were a rise in cases in the 1990s and since. Cholera became widespread in the 19th century. Since then it has killed tens of millions of people. In Russia alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died from the disease. It killed 150,000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920, perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera officially became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow, in England, in 1854 was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its source of transmission. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but it still strongly affects populations in developing countries. In the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers had cholera. No one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.Historically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore. Many of the older remedies were based on the miasma theory, that the disease was transmitted by bad air. Some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible, and flannel and cholera belts were included in army kits. In the 1854 1855 outbreak in Naples, homeopathic camphor was used according to Hahnemann. T. J. Ritter's Mother's Remedies book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern America. Elecampane was recommended in the United Kingdom, according to William Thomas Fernie. The first effective human vaccine was developed in 1885, and the first effective antibiotic was developed in 1948. Cholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments. In the 19th century the United States, for example, had a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. It had three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, which can be attributed to Vibrio cholerae's spread through interior waterways such as the Erie Canal and the extensive Mississippi River valley system, as well as the major ports along the Eastern Seaboard and their cities upriver. The island of Manhattan in New York City touches the Atlantic Ocean, where cholera collected from river waters and ship discharges just off the coast. At this time, New York City did not have as effective a sanitation system as it developed in the later 20th century, so cholera spread through the city's water supply.Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically to what is now defined as the disease of cholera.    Research  One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow , who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water. Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major state of the art review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human sewage contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854. His model was not immediately accepted, but it was increasingly seen as plausible as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so. For his work on cholera, John Snow is often regarded as the Father of Epidemiology .The bacterium was isolated in 1854 by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini, but its exact nature and his results were not widely known. In the same year, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the bacterium. In 1856 Ant nio Augusto da Costa Sim es and Jos Ferreira de Macedo Pinto, two Portuguese researchers, are believed to have done the same.Between the mid 1850s and the 1900s, cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well separated sewage treatment infrastructures. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, Robert Koch identified V. cholerae with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.Hemendra Nath Chatterjee, a Bengali scientist, was the first to formulate and demonstrate the effectiveness of oral rehydration salt to treat diarrhea. In his 1953 paper, published in The Lancet, he states that promethazine can stop vomiting during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible. The formulation of the fluid replacement solution was 4 g of sodium chloride, 25 g of glucose and 1000 ml of water. Indian medical scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered the cholera toxin, the animal model of cholera, and successfully demonstrated the method of transmission of cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae.Robert Allan Phillips, working at US Naval Medical Research Unit Two in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques. He developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the Lasker Foundation to award him its prize in 1967.More recently, in 2002, Alam, et al., studied stool samples from patients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of V. cholerae through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where genes that control biosynthesis of amino acids, iron uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the rice water stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.  Global Strategy  In 2017, the WHO launched the Ending Cholera: a global roadmap to 2030 strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90 by 2030. The strategy was developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control which develops country specific plans and monitors progress. The approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance, water sanitation, rehydration treatment and oral vaccines. Specifically, the control strategy focuses on three approaches: i early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks, ii stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots, and iii a global framework for cholera control through the GTFCC.The WHO and the GTFCC do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal. Even though humans are the only host of cholera, the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host. While global eradication is not possible, elimination of human to human transmission may be possible. Local elimination is possible, which has been underway most recently during the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Haiti aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022.The GTFCC targets 47 countries, 13 of which have established vaccination campaigns.  Society and culture   Health policy  In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease. Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the James Baker Institute. The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.Similarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera infected rivers.According to Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute, if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of Vibrio cholerae specimens. Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be Cholera affected ; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health. These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts. Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera. A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.  Notable cases  Tchaikovsky's death has traditionally been attributed to cholera, most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier. Tchaikovsky's mother died of cholera, and his father became sick with cholera at this time but made a full recovery. Some scholars, however, including English musicologist and Tchaikovsky authority David Brown and biographer Anthony Holden, have theorized that his death was a suicide. 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak. Ten months after the 2010 earthquake, an outbreak swept over Haiti, traced to a United Nations base of peacekeepers from Nepal. This marks the worst cholera outbreak in recent history, as well as the best documented cholera outbreak in modern public health. Adam Mickiewicz, Polish poet and novelist, is thought to have died of cholera in Istanbul in 1855. Sadi Carnot, physicist, a pioneer of thermodynamics Charles X, King of France James K. Polk, eleventh president of the United States Carl von Clausewitz, Prussian soldier and German military theorist Elliot Bovill, Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements Nikola Tesla, Serbian American inventor, engineer and futurist known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system, contracted cholera in 1873 at the age of 17. He was bedridden for nine months, and near death multiple times, but survived and fully recovered.  In popular culture  Unlike tuberculosis which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament, cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the lower classes living in filth and poverty. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease which includes voluminous rice water diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even the actual factual presentation of the disease in popular culture. The 1889 novel Mastro don Gesualdo by Giovanni Verga presents the course of a cholera epidemic across the island of Sicily, but does not show the suffering of those affected. In Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, first published in 1912 as Der Tod in Venedig, Mann presented the disease as emblematic of the final 'bestial degradation' of the sexually transgressive author Gustav von Aschenbach. Contrary to the actual facts of how violently cholera kills, Mann has his protagonist die peacefully on a beach in a deck chair. Luchino Visconti's 1971 film version also hid from the audience the actual course of the disease. Mann's novella was also made into an opera by Benjamin Britten in 1973, his last one, and into a ballet by John Neumeier for his Hamburg Ballet company, in December 2003. In Gabriel Garcia M rquez's 1985 novel Love in the Time of Cholera, cholera is a looming background presence rather than a central figure requiring vile description. The novel was adapted in 2007 for the film of the same name directed by Mike Newell.  Country examples   Zambia  In Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, most commonly in the capital city of Lusaka. In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. There was a rapid increase in the number of cases from several hundred cases in early December 2017 to approximately 2,000 by early January 2018. With intensification of the rains, new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported.In collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples.The Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one dose Oral Cholera Vaccine campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre emptive second round in December.  India  The city of Kolkata, India in the state of West Bengal in the Ganges delta has been described as the homeland of cholera , with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality. In India, where the disease is endemic, cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons. India is also characterized by high population density, unsafe drinking water, open drains, and poor sanitation which provide an optimal niche for survival, sustenance and transmission of Vibrio cholerae.  Democratic Republic of Congo  In Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history. Cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology, basic membrane biology, and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design.

            "text": "Frano Kr ini was a Croatian sculptor active in former Yugoslavia. Along with Ivan Me trovi and Antun Augustin i , he is considered one of the three most important Croatian sculptors of the 20th century. His most widely known work is the statue of Nikola Tesla installed at the Niagara Falls State Park, United States, an identical copy of the monument residing in front of the building of the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade .  Biography  Kr ini was born in 1897 in the village of Lumbarda on the Adriatic island of Kor ula in south Croatia, which was at the time part of the Austro Hungarian Empire. He was born into a family with a long tradition of stonemasonry, and he was also trained at the local stonemasonry school before going on to attend the stone working and masonry school in Ho ice in 1912. Upon graduation in 1916 he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague, where he studied in the classes of renowned Czech sculptors Josef V clav Myslbek and Jan tursa and graduated in 1920. He then returned to Croatia and settled in Zagreb, where he worked as a freelance sculptor before becoming a teacher of sculpting at the Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb in 1924. By the late 1920s his individual expression was formed, away from the mainstream of Art Deco and the overwhelming influence of Ivan Me trovi . In this period his style and sculptural elegance took shape through a number of works defined by soft lines in closed forms such as Awakening, Diana, Young Woman Tending a Rose, Reading, After the Bath and others. In the following decades Kr ini devoted himself to works marked by finer chiseling in marble, mostly of female art nudes and motherly motifs, such as sculptures titled Meditation, Mother Feeding a Child, etc. In 1947 he was made master sculptor and head of the sculpting workshop at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1948 he became a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In his last decades Krsinic created numerous small format sculptures which varied the theme of the young girl, as well as art nudes. Works such as Worry, Sunbathing and Resting are said to represent perfection in the softness of sculpting in marble. He retired from teaching in 1967 and in 1975 he stopped sculpting.

It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., it being the month of his birth. Before then it was called Quintilis, being the fifth month of the calendar that started with March.It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of winter. The second half of the year commences in July. In the Southern Hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere. Dog days are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere, when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts. Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.  July symbols July's birthstone is the ruby, which symbolizes contentment. Its birth flowers are the Larkspur or the Water Lily. The zodiac signs for the month of July are Cancer and Leo .

            "text": "Wireless telegraphy or radiotelegraphy is transmission of text messages by radio waves, analogous to electrical telegraphy using cables. Before about 1910, the term wireless telegraphy was also used for other experimental technologies for transmitting telegraph signals without wires. In radiotelegraphy, information is transmitted by pulses of radio waves of two different lengths called dots and dashes , which spell out text messages, usually in Morse code. In a manual system, the sending operator taps on a switch called a telegraph key which turns the transmitter on and off, producing the pulses of radio waves. At the receiver the pulses are audible in the receiver's speaker as beeps, which are translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code. Radiotelegraphy was the first means of radio communication. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers invented in 1894 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi used radiotelegraphy. It continued to be the only type of radio transmission during the first few decades of radio, called the wireless telegraphy era up until World War I, when the development of amplitude modulation radiotelephony allowed sound to be transmitted by radio. Beginning about 1908, powerful transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations transmitted commercial telegram traffic between countries at rates up to 200 words per minute. Radiotelegraphy was used for long distance person to person commercial, diplomatic, and military text communication throughout the first half of the 20th century. It became a strategically important capability during the two world wars since a nation without long distance radiotelegraph stations could be isolated from the rest of the world by an enemy cutting its submarine telegraph cables. Radiotelegraphy remains popular in amateur radio. It is also taught by the military for use in emergency communications. However, commercial radiotelegraphy is obsolete.  Overview  Wireless telegraphy or radiotelegraphy, commonly called CW , ICW transmission, or on off keying, and designated by the International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A or A2A, is a radio communication method. It was transmitted by several different modulation methods during its history. The primitive spark gap transmitters used until 1920 transmitted damped waves, which had very wide bandwidth and tended to interfere with other transmissions. This type of emission was banned by 1934, except for some legacy use on ships. The vacuum tube transmitters which came into use after 1920 transmitted code by pulses of unmodulated sinusoidal carrier wave called continuous wave , which is still used today. To receive CW transmissions, the receiver requires a circuit called a beat frequency oscillator . The third type of modulation, frequency shift keying was used mainly by radioteletype networks . Morse code radiotelegraphy was gradually replaced by radioteletype in most high volume applications by World War II. In manual radiotelegraphy the sending operator manipulates a switch called a telegraph key, which turns the radio transmitter on and off, producing pulses of unmodulated carrier wave of different lengths called dots and dashes , which encode characters of text in Morse code. At the receiving location, Morse code is audible in the receiver's earphone or speaker as a sequence of buzzes or beeps, which is translated back to text by an operator who knows Morse code. With automatic radiotelegraphy teleprinters at both ends use a code such as the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 and produced typed text. Radiotelegraphy is obsolete in commercial radio communication, and its last civilian use, requiring maritime shipping radio operators to use Morse code for emergency communications, ended in 1999 when the International Maritime Organization switched to the satellite based GMDSS system. However it is still used by amateur radio operators, and military services require signalmen to be trained in Morse code for emergency communication. A CW coastal station, KSM, still exists in California, run primarily as a museum by volunteers, and occasional contacts with ships are made. In a minor legacy use, VHF omnidirectional range and NDB radio beacons in the aviation radio navigation service still transmit their one to three letter identifiers in Morse code. Radiotelegraphy is popular amongst radio amateurs world wide, who commonly refer to it as continuous wave, or just CW. A 2021 analysis of over 700 million communications logged by the Club Log blog, and a similar review of data logged by the American Radio Relay League, both show that wireless telegraphy is the 2nd most popular mode of amateur radio communication, accounting for nearly 20 of contacts. This makes it more popular than voice communication, but not as popular as the FT8 digital mode, which accounted for 60 of amateur radio contacts made in 2021. Since 2003, knowledge of Morse code and wireless telegraphy has no longer been required to obtain an amateur radio license in many countries, it is, however, still required in some countries to obtain a licence of a different class. As of 2021, licence Class A in Belarus and Estonia, or the General class in Monaco, or Class 1 in Ukraine require Morse proficiency to access the full amateur radio spectrum including the high frequency bands. Further, CEPT Class 1 licence in Ireland, and Class 1 in Russia, both of which require proficiency in wireless telegraphy, offer additional privileges: a shorter and more desirable call sign in both countries, and the right to use a higher transmit power in Russia.  Non radio methods  Efforts to find a way to transmit telegraph signals without wires grew out of the success of electric telegraph networks, the first instant telecommunication systems. Developed beginning in the 1830s, a telegraph line was a person to person text message system consisting of multiple telegraph offices linked by an overhead wire supported on telegraph poles. To send a message, an operator at one office would tap on a switch called a telegraph key, creating pulses of electric current which spelled out a message in Morse code. When the key was pressed, it would connect a battery to the telegraph line, sending current down the wire. At the receiving office, the current pulses would operate a telegraph sounder, a device that would make a click sound when it received each pulse of current. The operator at the receiving station who knew Morse code would translate the clicking sounds to text and write down the message. The ground was used as the return path for current in the telegraph circuit, to avoid having to use a second overhead wire. By the 1860s, the telegraph was the standard way to send most urgent commercial, diplomatic and military messages, and industrial nations had built continent wide telegraph networks, with submarine telegraph cables allowing telegraph messages to bridge oceans. However installing and maintaining a telegraph line linking distant stations was very expensive, and wires could not reach some locations such as ships at sea. Inventors realized if a way could be found to send electrical impulses of Morse code between separate points without a connecting wire, it could revolutionize communications. The successful solution to this problem was the discovery of radio waves in 1887, and the development of practical radiotelegraphy transmitters and receivers by about 1899, described in the next section. However, this was preceded by a 50 year history of ingenious but ultimately unsuccessful experiments by inventors to achieve wireless telegraphy by other means.  Ground, water, and air conduction  Several wireless electrical signaling schemes based on the idea that electric currents could be conducted long range through water, ground, and air were investigated for telegraphy before practical radio systems became available. The original telegraph lines used two wires between the two stations to form a complete electrical circuit or loop . In 1837, however, Carl August von Steinheil of Munich, Germany, found that by connecting one leg of the apparatus at each station to metal plates buried in the ground, he could eliminate one wire and use a single wire for telegraphic communication. This led to speculation that it might be possible to eliminate both wires and therefore transmit telegraph signals through the ground without any wires connecting the stations. Other attempts were made to send the electric current through bodies of water, to span rivers, for example. Prominent experimenters along these lines included Samuel F. B. Morse in the United States and James Bowman Lindsay in Great Britain, who in August 1854, was able to demonstrate transmission across a mill dam at a distance of 500 yards . US inventors William Henry Ward and Mahlon Loomis developed electrical conduction systems based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. They thought atmosphere current, connected with a return path using Earth currents would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.In the 1890s inventor Nikola Tesla worked on an air and ground conduction wireless electric power transmission system, similar to Loomis', which he planned to include wireless telegraphy. Tesla's experiments had led him to incorrectly conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy and his 1901 large scale application of his ideas, a high voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, lost funding and was abandoned after a few years. Telegraphic communication using earth conductivity was eventually found to be limited to impractically short distances, as was communication conducted through water, or between trenches during World War I.  Electrostatic and electromagnetic induction  Both electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were used to develop wireless telegraph systems that saw limited commercial application. In the United States, Thomas Edison, in the mid 1880s, patented an electromagnetic induction system he called grasshopper telegraphy , which allowed telegraphic signals to jump the short distance between a running train and telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks. This system was successful technically but not economically, as there turned out to be little interest by train travelers in the use of an on board telegraph service. During the Great Blizzard of 1888, this system was used to send and receive wireless messages from trains buried in snowdrifts. The disabled trains were able to maintain communications via their Edison induction wireless telegraph systems, perhaps the first successful use of wireless telegraphy to send distress calls. Edison would also help to patent a ship to shore communication system based on electrostatic induction.The most successful creator of an electromagnetic induction telegraph system was William Preece, chief engineer of Post Office Telegraphs of the General Post Office in the United Kingdom. Preece first noticed the effect in 1884 when overhead telegraph wires in Grays Inn Road were accidentally carrying messages sent on buried cables. Tests in Newcastle succeeded in sending a quarter of a mile using parallel rectangles of wire.: 243 In tests across the Bristol Channel in 1892, Preece was able to telegraph across gaps of about 5 kilometres . However, his induction system required extensive lengths of antenna wires, many kilometers long, at both the sending and receiving ends. The length of those sending and receiving wires needed to be about the same length as the width of the water or land to be spanned. For example, for Preece's station to span the English Channel from Dover, England, to the coast of France would require sending and receiving wires of about 30 miles along the two coasts. These facts made the system impractical on ships, boats, and ordinary islands, which are much smaller than Great Britain or Greenland. Also, the relatively short distances that a practical Preece system could span meant that it had few advantages over underwater telegraph cables.  Radiotelegraphy  Over several years starting in 1894, the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi worked on adapting the newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves to communication, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment up to that point into a useful communication system, building the first radiotelegraphy system using them. Preece and the GPO in Britain at first supported and gave financial backing to Marconi's experiments conducted on Salisbury Plain from 1896. Preece had become convinced of the idea through his experiments with wireless induction. However, the backing was withdrawn when Marconi formed the Wireless Telegraph Signal Company. GPO lawyers determined that the system was a telegraph under the meaning of the Telegraph Act and thus fell under the Post Office monopoly. This did not seem to hold back Marconi.: 243 244 After Marconi sent wireless telegraphic signals across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901, the system began being used for regular communication including ship to shore and ship to ship communication.With this development, wireless telegraphy came to mean radiotelegraphy, Morse code transmitted by radio waves. The first radio transmitters, primitive spark gap transmitters used until World War I, could not transmit voice . Instead, the operator would send the text message on a telegraph key, which turned the transmitter on and off, producing short and long pulses of radio waves, groups of which comprised the letters and other symbols of the Morse code. At the receiver, the signals could be heard as musical beeps in the earphones by the receiving operator, who would translate the code back into text. By 1910, communication by what had been called Hertzian waves was being universally referred to as radio , and the term wireless telegraphy has been largely replaced by the more modern term radiotelegraphy .  Continuous wave  The primitive spark gap transmitters used until 1920 transmitted by a modulation method called damped wave. As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter would produce a string of transient pulses of radio waves which repeated at an audio rate, usually between 50 and several thousand hertz. In a receiver's earphone, this sounded like a musical tone, rasp or buzz. Thus the Morse code dots and dashes sounded like beeps. Damped wave had a large frequency bandwidth, meaning that the radio signal was not a single frequency but occupied a wide band of frequencies. Damped wave transmitters had a limited range and interfered with the transmissions of other transmitters on adjacent frequencies. After 1905 new types of radiotelegraph transmitters were invented which transmitted code using a new modulation method: continuous wave . As long as the telegraph key was pressed, the transmitter produced a continuous sinusoidal wave of constant amplitude. Since all the radio wave's energy was concentrated at a single frequency, CW transmitters could transmit further with a given power, and also caused virtually no interference to transmissions on adjacent frequencies. The first transmitters able to produce continuous wave were the arc converter transmitter, invented by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen in 1903, and the Alexanderson alternator, invented 1906 1912 by Reginald Fessenden and Ernst Alexanderson. These slowly replaced the spark transmitters in high power radiotelegraphy stations. However, the radio receivers used for damped wave could not receive continuous wave. Because the CW signal produced while the key was pressed was just an unmodulated carrier wave, it made no sound in a receiver's earphones. To receive a CW signal, some way had to be found to make the Morse code carrier wave pulses audible in a receiver. This problem was solved by Reginald Fessenden in 1901. In his heterodyne receiver, the incoming radiotelegraph signal is mixed in the receiver's detector crystal or vacuum tube with a constant sine wave generated by an electronic oscillator in the receiver called a beat frequency oscillator . The frequency of the oscillator         f      BFO          displaystyle f text BFO  is offset from the radio transmitter's frequency         f      IN          displaystyle f text IN  . In the detector the two frequencies subtract, and a beat frequency at the difference between the two frequencies is produced:         f      BEAT                    f      IN             f      BFO                  displaystyle f text BEAT f text IN f text BFO  . If the BFO frequency is near enough to the radio station's frequency, the beat frequency is in the audio frequency range and can be heard in the receiver's earphones. During the dots and dashes of the signal, the beat tone is produced, while between them there is no carrier so no tone is produced. Thus the Morse code is audible as musical beeps in the earphones. The BFO was rare until the invention in 1913 of the first practical electronic oscillator, the vacuum tube feedback oscillator by Edwin Armstrong. After this time BFOs were a standard part of radiotelegraphy receivers. Each time the radio was tuned to a different station frequency, the BFO frequency had to be changed also, so the BFO oscillator had to be tunable. In later superheterodyne receivers from the 1930s on, the BFO signal was mixed with the constant intermediate frequency produced by the superheterodyne's detector. Therefore, the BFO could be a fixed frequency. Continuous wave vacuum tube transmitters replaced the other types of transmitter with the availability of power tubes after World War I because they were cheap. CW became the standard method of transmitting radiotelegraphy by the 20s, damped wave spark transmitters were banned by 1930 and CW continues to be used today. Even today most communications receivers produced for use in shortwave communication stations have BFOs.  The radiotelegraphy industry  The International Radiotelegraph Union was unofficially established at the first International Radiotelegraph Convention in 1906, and was merged into the International Telecommunication Union in 1932. When the United States entered World War I, private radiotelegraphy stations were prohibited, which put an end to several pioneers' work in this field. By the 1920s, there was a worldwide network of commercial and government radiotelegraphic stations, plus extensive use of radiotelegraphy by ships for both commercial purposes and passenger messages. The transmission of sound began to displace radiotelegraphy by the 1920s for many applications, making possible radio broadcasting. Wireless telegraphy continued to be used for private person to person business, governmental, and military communication, such as telegrams and diplomatic communications, and evolved into radioteletype networks. The ultimate implementation of wireless telegraphy was telex, using radio signals, which was developed in the 1930s and was for many years the only reliable form of communication between many distant countries. The most advanced standard, CCITT R.44, automated both routing and encoding of messages by short wave transmissions. Today, due to more modern text transmission methods, Morse code radiotelegraphy for commercial use has become obsolete. On shipboard, the computer and satellite linked GMDSS system have largely replaced Morse as a means of communication.  Regulation of radiotelegraphy  Continuous wave radiotelegraphy is regulated by the International Telecommunication Union as emission type A1A. The US Federal Communications Commission issues a lifetime commercial Radiotelegraph Operator License. This requires passing a simple written test on regulations, a more complex written exam on technology, and demonstrating Morse reception at 20 words per minute plain language and 16 wpm code groups.

            "text": "Gospi is a town in the mountainous and sparsely populated region of Lika, Croatia. It is the administrative centre of Lika Senj County. Gospi is located near the Lika River in the middle of a karst field . Gospi is the third smallest seat of a county government in Croatia. Its status as the county capital helped to spur some development in it, but the town as well as the entire region have suffered a constant decrease in population over the last several decades. Scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla was born in the nearby village of Smiljan and grew up in Gospi .  Municipality   History  The first organised inhabitation of the area was recorded in 1263 as Kaseg or Kasezi. The name Gospi is first mentioned in 1604, which likely originates from the Croatian word for lady or another archaic form, gospava. It was ruled by Ottoman Empire as part of Sanjak of Lika initially in Rumeli Eyalet , later in Bosnia Eyalet . Today's town was built around two Ottoman forts . The Turkish incursion was repelled by the end of the 17th century and Gospi became an administrative centre of the Lika region within the Military Frontier. Until 1918, Gospi was part of the Austrian monarchy , in the Croatian Military Frontier, Likaner Regiment N I. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Gospi was part of the Lika Krbava County of the Kingdom of Croatia Slavonia. During the Genocide of Serbs by the Usta e in WWII, the district of Gospi experienced the first large scale massacres which occurred in the Lika region, as some 3,000 Serb civilians were killed between late July and early August 1941. A concentration camp was established in Gospi in which the Usta e might have killed between 24,000 42,000 people, most of them being Serbs and Jews, but some of the prisoners were also Croatian.In the 1990s, during the course of the Croatian War of Independence, Gospi suffered greatly during the Battle of Gospi . The town was held by Croatian government forces throughout the war, while the rebel Serb forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina occupied positions directly to the east and often bombarded the town from there. In February 1992, a statue of the Serb scientist Nikola Tesla in downtown Gospi was destroyed in an explosion. The perpetrators were never apprehended. The town was the site of the Gospi massacre, where between 100 120 predominantly Serb civilians were killed by Croatian military units. Control of the area finally devolved to the Croatian government with the success of Operation Storm in August 1995.Gospic is also the site of one of the regional branches of the Croatian State Archives, the Dr avni arhiv Gospi , at Kani ka 17. It was founded 30 September 1999 and officially opened 1 September 2000 in a renovated building and now houses historical documents of relevance to the Lika Senj region which were formerly housed in the Regional Archive at Karlovac. In 2013, Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovi urged the town's authorities to allow for a replica of the Tesla statue that had been destroyed in 1992 to be reinstated. The mayor of Gospi , Nikola Koli , refused to give his approval for such a move and instead vowed to erect a statue of wartime Croatian President Franjo Tu man on the spot where the Tesla statue had once stood.

Being situated higher than 500 metres above sea level, the area experiences high diurnal ranges, especially in summer, and frost has been recorded in every month except for July. The record low and high temperatures are 33.5 C and 38.7 C , respectively. Gospi is also quite a rainy city, with a slight summer minimum, but it experiences plentiful precipitation all year long, with the maximum being in autumn. During winter, Gospi can get strong blizzards, with on average 5.1 days a year when more than 50 cm falls, and 16.1 days when more than 30 cm falls. Its record snow cover was 285 cm , and it was measured in February 1916.

Early work Almereyda studied art history at Harvard but dropped out after three years to pursue filmmaking. He acquired a Hollywood agent on the strength of a spec script about Nikola Tesla. His first film as writer director was a self financed, black and white short featuring Dennis Hopper, A Hero of Our Time, based on Mikhail Lermontov's novel of the same title. Shot in 1985, it was finished in 1987 and screened in the 1992 Sundance Film Festival. Early screenplays include Cherry 2000 , the first draft for Wim Wenders Until the End of the World , and uncredited work on Total Recall . Almereyda's films range across many genres, styles, and formats. His first feature, Twister , based on Mary Robison s novel Oh, was a comedy about a dysfunctional mid Western family. Another Girl Another Planet was a romantic chamber piece, a black and white, one hour featurette shot with a Fisher Price Pixelvision camera.Nadja was a comic vampire film shot on 35mm with Pixelvision inserts. Hamlet was shot on Super 16mm and featured Ethan Hawke, Bill Murray, Kyle MacLachlan, Julia Stiles, Liev Schreiber and Sam Shepard. The adaptation layered a contemporary New York setting on Shakespeare's text.  2000s Almereyda directed features set in pre and post Katrina New Orleans: Happy Here and Now and New Orleans, Mon Amour . In 2004, he directed an episode of the HBO series Deadwood, His most recent work has mainly involved documentaries and shorts. William Eggleston in the Real World was nominated for a Gotham Award for Best Documentary from the Independent Filmmaker Project, as was the sketchbook film Paradise . He has recently returned to fiction film with a 2013 adaptation of Shakespeare s Cymbeline, a spiritual successor to his earlier Hamlet. Experimenter , was based on the life of Stanley Milgram, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received critical acclaim. Marjorie Prime , a philosophical science fiction film based on Jordan Harrison's play of the same name, again screened at Sundance and won the Sloan Feature Film Prize. Most recently, he has directed a documentary on Hampton Fancher and adapted his Tesla spec script into a 2020 film of the same name. Almereyda edited and contributed texts for Night Wraps the Sky: Writings by and About Mayakovsky, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 2008, and William Eggleston: For Now, published by Twin Palms in 2010.

            "text": "The Secret of Nikola Tesla , is a 1980 Yugoslav biographical film which dramatizes events in the life of the Serbian American engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla. This somewhat fictionalized portrayal of Tesla's life has him contending with Thomas Edison and J.P. Morgan in his attempts to develop alternating current and then free wireless power.  Plot Tesla in a hotel room in 1943 talks to a reporter. He then reminisces about how things would be different if J. P Morgan had listened to him. Tesla arrives in the US in the 1880s. He tries to convince his new employer, Thomas Edison, to adopt his newly invented electric induction motor running on an alternating current system but Edison claims direct current is better and turns him down. Robert Underwood Johnson and his wife Katharine, who were at the meeting, later find Tesla digging a ditch, having quit his job at Edison. Tesla strikes a business deal with two investors to finance development of his motor. He shows off his AC system at meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers but Edison, in the audience, claims it is impractical. After the reporters, and even Tesla's own investors, turn away from him George Westinghouse convinces Tesla to sell him his AC patents and offers a contract to pay Tesla a royalty on his motor design. They end up in a public battle trying to demonstrate the their system is not unsafe and is actually better than DC. J.P. Morgan, pulling the strings in the background, calls Tesla and Edison into a meeting and, unhappy with Edison progress electrifying his factories, tells Tesla he can try to prove AC would work better. At a banquet celebrating the building of an alternating current power plant at Niagara Falls Tesla confuses the audience with his futuristic ideas about his high frequency wireless AC transmission system and then tells someone he is off to Europe to see his family . On that trip he visits his bed ridden mother who dies in his arms. He then wanders out in the country side having flash backs about his childhood and the death of his brother, all punctuated by visions of falling water and lightning. Westinghouse and Katharine visit Tesla back at his New York lab where the inventor tears up his royalty contract to save Westinghouse from financial ruin. Tesla goes on to develop his wireless power system, making several reports to Morgan on his progress. Morgan tells Tesla he is unhappy with wild stories about the inventor but keeps backing him. Westinghouse warns Tesla to watch out for Morgan's motives and Katharine tells the inventor how she wished they could have had more of a relationship together. Tesla learns from Morgan that Guglielmo Marconi has stolen his wireless patents and that Albert Einstein has new theories about matter and energy. Tesla tells Morgan these new theories are a crime against nature and tries to get Morgan to back his free wireless power system before it is too late. After Tesla leaves Morgan says he won't back a system that would put him out of business and orders all further interaction with Tesla cut off. Tesla looks over his demolished Wardenclyffe station and complains, at the end of his life in a world choked with smog, that he wished Morgan had listened to him.  Cast Petar Bo ovi as Nikola Tesla Strother Martin as George Westinghouse Orson Welles as J. P. Morgan Dennis Patrick as Thomas Edison Oja Kodar as Katharine Johnson Boris Buzan i as Robert Underwood Johnson Charles Millot as Adams Igor Galo as Guglielmo Marconi Vanja Drach as Mark Twain  Production The film was shot in the former Yugoslavia. Besides lead Yugoslavian actor Petar Bo ovi , director Krsto Papi assembled a cast which includes three American actors playing iconic personalities of 19th and early 20th century America, Orson Welles as Morgan, Strother Martin as Westinghouse, and Dennis Patrick as Edison. Croatian actress Oja Kodar, playing Katharine, had been Welles' companion for almost two decades at the time of filming. The film was written by Ivo Bre an, Ivan Ku an, and Krsto Papic. Two American writers contributed to the screenplay and are cited with on screen credits. They are John W. English, University of Georgia journalism professor, and Dee Brown, author of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. They were commissioned by Zagreb Film Studio director and pre production coordinator Zelimir Matko.  Release The film was premiered in Yugoslavia on Tesla Day, July 10, 1980. The film had a further September 12, 1980 English language premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and had a small US theatrical run in 1985.  Critical reception  Online reviewers note the accurate portrayal of period settings and costumes and thought the major interest for most audiences would be the portrayal of Morgan by Orson Wells. The low production values, continual switching between Serbo Croatian and poorly dubbed English, and flashbacks burred within further flashbacks were found distracting. It is noted to play like a history lesson instead of a study of Nikola Tesla's character. A 3 Quarks Daily commentator thought the conspiracy plot of a messianic wizard vs the capitalist baddies was campy.

It is the oldest medal in this field of engineering. The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, small gold replica, certificate, and honorarium. The medal may only be awarded to a new leap breakthrough in the technological area of science.  Background The Edison Medal, named after the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison, was created on 11 February 1904 by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. Other recipients of the Edison Medal include George Westinghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, Michael I. Pupin, Robert A. Millikan , and Vannevar Bush. A complete and authoritative list is published by the IEEE online.After the merger of AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers , in 1963, to form the IEEE, it was decided that IRE's Medal of Honor would be presented as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal. Eleven persons with an exceptional career in electrical engineering received both the IEEE Edison Medal and the IEEE Medal of Honor, namely Edwin Howard Armstrong, Ernst Alexanderson, Mihajlo Pupin, Arthur E. Kennelly, Vladimir K. Zworykin, John R. Pierce, Sidney Darlington, James L. Flanagan, Nick Holonyak, Robert H. Dennard, Dave Forney, and Kees Schouhamer Immink.

            "text": "Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use. Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics control, and electrical materials science.Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Institution of Engineering and Technology . Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.  History  Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term electricity . He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.  19th century  In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of Hans Christian rsted who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle, of William Sturgeon who, in 1825 invented the electromagnet, of Joseph Henry and Edward Davy who invented the electrical relay in 1835, of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor, of Michael Faraday , and of James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise Electricity and Magnetism.In 1782, Georges Louis Le Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the world's first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leaf through electrical conduction. In 1795, Francisco Salva Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system. Between 1803 and 1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy and in 1804, he presented his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Salva's electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two new discoveries made in Europe in 1800 Alessandro Volta's electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle's electrolysis of water. Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline. Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy. Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893. The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics since the early electrical technology was considered electromechanical in nature. The Technische Universit t Darmstadt founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882 and introduced the first degree course in electrical engineering in 1883. The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, though it was Cornell University to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885. The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts. It was not until about 1885 that Cornell President Andrew Dickson White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States. In the same year, University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain. Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at University of Missouri soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886. Afterwards, universities and institutes of technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world. During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first large scale electric power network that provided 110 volts direct current  to 59 customers on Manhattan Island in New York City. In 1884, Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation. Alternating current, with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of transformers, developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by K roly Zipernowsky, Ott Bl thy and Miksa D ri , Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs and William Stanley, Jr. Practical AC motor designs including induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and further developed into a practical three phase form by Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown. Charles Steinmetz and Oliver Heaviside contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering. The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the war of the currents between a George Westinghouse backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.  Early 20th century  During the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James Clerk Maxwell during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of electromagnetic radiation including the possibility of invisible airborne waves . In his classic physics experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting radio waves with a spark gap transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these Hertzian waves into a purpose built commercial wireless telegraphic system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2,100 miles .Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 1894 1896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60 GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun introduced the cathode ray tube as part of an oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic television. John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the triode.In 1920, Albert Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the development of the microwave oven in 1946 by Percy Spencer. In 1934, the British military began to make strides toward radar under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936.In 1941, Konrad Zuse presented the Z3, the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943, Tommy Flowers designed and built the Colossus, the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer. In 1946, the ENIAC of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives.In 1948 Claude Shannon publishes A Mathematical Theory of Communication which mathematically describes the passage of information with uncertainty .  Solid state electronics  The first working transistor was a point contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947. They then invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. While early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass production basis, they opened the door for more compact devices.The first integrated circuits were the hybrid integrated circuit invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959.The MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at BTL in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass produced for a wide range of uses. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.The MOSFET made it possible to build high density integrated circuit chips. The earliest experimental MOS IC chip to be fabricated was built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA Laboratories in 1962. MOS technology enabled Moore's law, the doubling of transistors on an IC chip every two years, predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965. Silicon gate MOS technology was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968. Since then, the MOSFET has been the basic building block of modern electronics. The mass production of silicon MOSFETs and MOS integrated circuit chips, along with continuous MOSFET scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace , has since led to revolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and thinking.The Apollo program which culminated in landing astronauts on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 was enabled by NASA's adoption of advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including MOSFETs in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer .The development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. The first single chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. The Intel 4004 was designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon gate MOS technology, along with Intel's Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal computers, and the microcomputer revolution.  Subfields One of the properties of electricity is that it is very useful for energy transmission as well as for information transmission. These were also the first areas in which electrical engineering was developed. Today electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer engineering, are considered disciplines in their own right.  Power and energy  Power Energy engineering deals with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called on grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called off grid power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.  Telecommunications  Telecommunications engineering focuses on the transmission of information across a communication channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer. Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. Typically, if the power of the transmitted signal is insufficient once the signal arrives at the receiver's antenna , the information contained in the signal will be corrupted by noise, specifically static.  Control engineering  Control engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electronics control engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controllers . Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also plays an important role in industrial automation. Control engineers often use feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. Control engineers also work in robotics to design autonomous systems using control algorithms which interpret sensory feedback to control actuators that move robots such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous drones and others used in a variety of industries.  Electronics  Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality. The tuned circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner. Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as radio engineering and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering. Before the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number often millions of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.  Microelectronics and nanoelectronics  Microelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components can be created at a microscopic level. Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100 nm processing having been standard since around 2002.Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.  Signal processing  Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of digital signal processing and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, audio engineering, broadcast engineering, power electronics, and biomedical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. Analog signal processing is still important in the design of many control systems. DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital television sets, radios, Hi Fi audio equipment, mobile phones, multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, noise cancelling headphones, digital spectrum analyzers, missile guidance systems, radar systems, and telematics systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for noise reduction, speech recognition or synthesis, encoding or decoding digital media, wirelessly transmitting or receiving data, triangulating positions using GPS, and other kinds of image processing, video processing, audio processing, and speech processing.  Instrumentation  Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.  Computers  Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new hardware. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Desktop computers represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer like architectures are now found in a range of embedded devices including video game consoles and DVD players. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing. Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.  Photonics and optics  Photonics and optics deals with the generation, transmission, amplification, modulation, detection, and analysis of electromagnetic radiation. The application of optics deals with design of optical instruments such as lenses, microscopes, telescopes, and other equipment that uses the properties of electromagnetic radiation. Other prominent applications of optics include electro optical sensors and measurement systems, lasers, fiber optic communication systems, and optical disc systems . Photonics builds heavily on optical technology, supplemented with modern developments such as optoelectronics , laser systems, optical amplifiers and novel materials .  Related disciplines  Mechatronics is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles. Electronic systems design is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical systems , are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.In Aerospace engineering and robotics, an example is the most recent electric propulsion and ion propulsion.  Education  Electrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, electrical engineering technology, or electrical and electronic engineering. The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Electronics Engineering Technology, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Technology, or Bachelor of Applied Science, depending on the university. The bachelor's degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and a variety of topics in electrical engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study. At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering , but in others, electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering Master of Science , a Master of Engineering Management, a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering, an Engineering Doctorate , or an Engineer's degree. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than a standalone postgraduate degree.  Professional practice  In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer , Chartered engineer or Incorporated Engineer , Chartered Professional Engineer or European Engineer . The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients . This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law. Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Institution of Engineering and Technology . The IEEE claims to produce 30 of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually. The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe. Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer engineer.In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25 of the labor force.  Tools and work From the Global Positioning System to electric power generation, electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of telecommunication systems, the operation of electric power stations, the lighting and wiring of buildings, the design of household appliances, or the electrical control of industrial machinery. Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer aided design programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others. Although most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit theory , the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI , but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off the shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, and the ability to understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering. A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers. For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. Where time varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting. For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important. The workplaces of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant, on board a Naval ship, the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers, and other engineers.Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences. For instance, the physicist Lord Kelvin played a major role in the engineering of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Conversely, the engineer Oliver Heaviside produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables. Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects. For instance, large particle accelerators such as CERN need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project including the power distribution, the instrumentation, and the manufacture and installation of the superconducting electromagnets.

            "text": "Wilhelm Conrad R ntgen ; 27 March 1845 10 February 1923 was a German mechanical engineer and physicist, who, on 8 November 1895, produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range known as X rays or R ntgen rays, an achievement that earned him the inaugural Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. In honour of R ntgen's accomplishments, in 2004 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry named element 111, roentgenium, a radioactive element with multiple unstable isotopes, after him. The unit of measurement roentgen was also named after him.  Biographical history   Education  He was born to Friedrich Conrad R ntgen, a German merchant and cloth manufacturer, and Charlotte Constanze Frowein. At age three his family moved to Holland where his family lived. R ntgen attended high school at Utrecht Technical School in Utrecht, Netherlands. He followed courses at the Technical School for almost two years. In 1865, he was unfairly expelled from high school when one of his teachers intercepted a caricature of one of the teachers, which was drawn by someone else. Without a high school diploma, R ntgen could only attend university in the Netherlands as a visitor. In 1865, he tried to attend Utrecht University without having the necessary credentials required for a regular student. Upon hearing that he could enter the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich , he passed the entrance examination and began studies there as a student of mechanical engineering. In 1869, he graduated with a PhD from the University of Zurich; once there, he became a favorite student of Professor August Kundt, whom he followed to the newly founded German Kaiser Wilhelms Universit t in Strasbourg.  Career  In 1874, R ntgen became a lecturer at the University of Strasbourg. In 1875, he became a professor at the Academy of Agriculture at Hohenheim, W rttemberg. He returned to Strasbourg as a professor of physics in 1876, and in 1879, he was appointed to the chair of physics at the University of Giessen. In 1888, he obtained the physics chair at the University of W rzburg, and in 1900 at the University of Munich, by special request of the Bavarian government. R ntgen had family in Iowa in the United States and planned to emigrate. He accepted an appointment at Columbia University in New York City and bought transatlantic tickets, before the outbreak of World War I changed his plans. He remained in Munich for the rest of his career. During 1895, at his laboratory in the W rzburg Physical Institute of the University of W rzburg, R ntgen was investigating the external effects from the various types of vacuum tube equipment apparatuses from Heinrich Hertz, Johann Hittorf, William Crookes, Nikola Tesla and Philipp von Lenard when an electrical discharge is passed through them. In early November, he was repeating an experiment with one of Lenard's tubes in which a thin aluminium window had been added to permit the cathode rays to exit the tube but a cardboard covering was added to protect the aluminium from damage by the strong electrostatic field that produces the cathode rays. R ntgen knew that the cardboard covering prevented light from escaping, yet he observed that the invisible cathode rays caused a fluorescent effect on a small cardboard screen painted with barium platinocyanide when it was placed close to the aluminium window. It occurred to R ntgen that the Crookes Hittorf tube, which had a much thicker glass wall than the Lenard tube, might also cause this fluorescent effect. In the late afternoon of 8 November 1895, R ntgen was determined to test his idea. He carefully constructed a black cardboard covering similar to the one he had used on the Lenard tube. He covered the Crookes Hittorf tube with the cardboard and attached electrodes to a Ruhmkorff coil to generate an electrostatic charge. Before setting up the barium platinocyanide screen to test his idea, R ntgen darkened the room to test the opacity of his cardboard cover. As he passed the Ruhmkorff coil charge through the tube, he determined that the cover was light tight and turned to prepare the next step of the experiment. It was at this point that R ntgen noticed a faint shimmering from a bench a few feet away from the tube. To be sure, he tried several more discharges and saw the same shimmering each time. Striking a match, he discovered the shimmering had come from the location of the barium platinocyanide screen he had been intending to use next. R ntgen speculated that a new kind of ray might be responsible. 8 November was a Friday, so he took advantage of the weekend to repeat his experiments and made his first notes. In the following weeks, he ate and slept in his laboratory as he investigated many properties of the new rays he temporarily termed X rays , using the mathematical designation for something unknown. The new rays came to bear his name in many languages as R ntgen rays . At one point while he was investigating the ability of various materials to stop the rays, R ntgen brought a small piece of lead into position while a discharge was occurring. R ntgen thus saw the first radiographic image: his own flickering ghostly skeleton on the barium platinocyanide screen. He later reported that it was at this point that he decided to continue his experiments in secrecy, fearing for his professional reputation if his observations were in error. About six weeks after his discovery, he took a picture a radiograph using X rays of his wife Anna Bertha's hand. When she saw her skeleton she exclaimed I have seen my death! He later took a better picture of his friend Albert von K lliker's hand at a public lecture. R ntgen's original paper, On A New Kind of Rays , was published on 28 December 1895. On 5 January 1896, an Austrian newspaper reported R ntgen's discovery of a new type of radiation. R ntgen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of W rzburg after his discovery. He also received the Rumford Medal of the British Royal Society in 1896, jointly with Philipp Lenard, who had already shown that a portion of the cathode rays could pass through a thin film of a metal such as aluminium. R ntgen published a total of three papers on X rays between 1895 and 1897. Today, R ntgen is considered the father of diagnostic radiology, the medical speciality which uses imaging to diagnose disease. A collection of his papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.  Personal life  R ntgen was married to Anna Bertha Ludwig for 47 years until her death in 1919 at age 80. In 1866 they met in Z rich at Anna's father's caf , Zum Gr nen Glas. They got engaged in 1869 and wed in Apeldoorn, Netherlands on 7 July 1872; the delay was due to Anna being six years Wilhelm's senior and his father not approving of her age or humble background. Their marriage began with financial difficulties as family support from R ntgen had ceased. They raised one child, Josephine Bertha Ludwig, whom they adopted at age 6 after her father, Anna's only brother, died in 1887. He inherited two million Reichsmarks after his father's death. For ethical reasons, R ntgen did not seek patents for his discoveries, holding the view that it should be publicly available without charge. After receiving his Nobel prize money, R ntgen donated the 50,000 Swedish krona to research at the University of W rzburg. Although he accepted the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine, he rejected an offer of lower nobility, or Niederer Adelstitel, denying the preposition von as a nobiliary particle . With the inflation following World War I, R ntgen fell into bankruptcy, spending his final years at his country home at Weilheim, near Munich. R ntgen died on 10 February 1923 from carcinoma of the intestine, also known as colorectal cancer. In keeping with his will, all his personal and scientific correspondence were destroyed upon his death.  Honours and awards In 1901, R ntgen was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics. The award was officially in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the remarkable rays subsequently named after him . R ntgen donated the 50,000 Swedish krona reward from his Nobel Prize to research at his university, the University of W rzburg. Like Marie and Pierre Curie, R ntgen refused to take out patents related to his discovery of X rays, as he wanted society as a whole to benefit from practical applications of the phenomenon. R ntgen was also awarded Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1900.His honors include: Rumford Medal Matteucci Medal Elliott Cresson Medal Nobel Prize for Physics In November 2004 IUPAC named element number 111 roentgenium in his honour. IUPAP adopted the name in November 2011.In 1907 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Legacy Today, in Remscheid Lennep, 40 kilometres east of R ntgen's birthplace in D sseldorf, is the Deutsches R ntgen Museum. In W rzburg, where he discovered X rays, a non profit organization maintains his laboratory and provides guided tours to the R ntgen Memorial Site.World Radiography Day: World Radiography Day is an annual event promoting the role of medical imaging in modern healthcare. It is celebrated on 8 November each year, coinciding with the anniversary of the R ntgen's discovery. It was first introduced in 2012 as a joint initiative between the European Society of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, and the American College of Radiology. R ntgen Peak in Antarctica is named after Wilhelm R ntgen.Minor planet 6401 Roentgen is named after him.

            "text": "The Electrical Experimenter was an American technical science magazine that was published monthly. It was established in May 1913, as the successor to Modern Electrics, a combination of a magazine and mail order catalog that had been published by Hugo Gernsback starting in 1908. The Electrical Experimenter continued from May 1913 to July 1920 under that name, focusing on scientific articles about radio, and continued with a broader focus as Science and Invention until August 1931.The magazine was edited by Hugo Gernsback until March 1929, when the Experimenter Publishing empire of Sidney and Hugo Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy; after that date it was edited by Arthur H. Lynch.Under the editorship of Gernsback, it also published some early science fiction; he published several of his own stories in the magazine starting in 1915, and encouraged others through a 1916 editorial arguing that a real electrical experimenter, worthy of the name must have imagination and a vision for the future. Between August 1917 and July 1919, Nikola Tesla wrote five articles for the magazine, and also published parts of his autobiography in segments in several issues in 1919.

            "text": "John George Trump was an American electrical engineer, inventor, and physicist. A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1936 to 1973, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Trump was noted for developing rotational radiation therapy. Together with Robert J. Van de Graaff, he developed one of the first million volt X ray generators.  Early life and education John was the youngest of three children, and the second son of German immigrants Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump. He was born in New York City on August 21, 1907.John's brother, Fred, joined their mother in real estate development and management while still in his teens . Initially, John and his brother tried working together building houses, but ultimately they dissolved their partnership, and John pursued a career in electrical engineering. Trump received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering in 1929, his master's degree in physics from Columbia University, and his doctorate of electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1933. He was a professor at MIT from 1936 until 1973.  War service During World War II, Trump switched from work on hospital X ray machines to research into similar technologies, especially the development of radar. During 1940, he joined the newly formed National Defense Research Committee , as technical aide to Karl Compton, President of MIT, who was serving also as the Chairman of the Radar Division within the NDRC.During 1942, Trump became Secretary of the Microwave Committee, a sub committee of the NDRC. The director of the Microwave Committee was Alfred Lee Loomis, the millionaire physicist , who decided to create a laboratory. He selected a site for it, chose a suitably discreet and ambiguous name for it, and funded its construction, until governmental administration was established. The new institution came to be called the MIT Radiation Laboratory, or the Rad Lab . As wartime shortages in Britain increased, many of its radar researchers would move to the well funded laboratory at MIT, where they helped create groundbreaking progress in developing practical devices and systems, which would see widespread field deployment in combat. The British had already started researching radar, which they termed Radio Direction Finder . Their Tizard Mission to the US showed how much more advanced they were with some of the key technologies, particularly the magnetron. The US decided to send a team to Britain to help coordinate their efforts with the British Branch of the Radiation Laboratory , which operated as a department of Britain's Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern, in Worcestershire. From February 1944 to the end of the war in Europe, Trump was the Director of the BBRL.In early 1943, two days after the death of Nikola Tesla, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Office of Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. Trump was called in to analyze the Tesla artifacts, which were being held in government custody. After a three day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands.During the war, Trump also served in the Advisory Specialist Group on Radar, advising USAAF General Carl Spaatz on navigational radar, precision bombing radar, and also defenses against the German radars found in their night fighters and in their flak units. The systems included: Gee, Oboe, LORAN, H2X, MEW SCR 584. Trump worked with all the most important British radar experts, including Sir Robert Watson Watt, A.P. Rowe, and Bernard Lovell. At the end of the war, Trump also conducted debriefing interviews with Germany's main radar technicians. Trump received recognition for his war work partnership from both the United States and the United Kingdom.  Post war career In 1946, Trump, Robert J. Van de Graaff, and Denis M. Robinson initiated the High Voltage Engineering Corporation to produce Van de Graaff generators.He returned to MIT to teach and direct research for three decades after the war. He directed the MIT High Voltage Research Laboratory from 1946 to 1980. Some of his research at MIT concentrated on treating wastewater. He researched using an electron beam from a high voltage accelerator as the deactivating agent in the treatment of municipal wastewater sludge. The High Voltage Research Laboratory developed a prototype system that was tested at one of Boston's wastewater treatment plants, and it was able to provide bacterial and viral disinfection via continuous on line treatment.Trump died in Boston on February 21, 1985.The National Academy of Engineering described John Trump as a pioneer in the scientific, engineering and medical applications of high voltage machinery . James Melcher, Trump's lab director, is quoted as saying: John, over a period of three decades, would be approached by people of all sorts because he could make megavolt beams of ions and electrons death rays... What did he do with it? Cancer research, sterilizing sludge out in Deer Island a waste disposal facility , all sorts of wondrous things. He didn't touch the weapons stuff.  Personal life John G. Trump was a member of the Trump family. He married Elora Sauerbrun , and they had three children: the late John Gordon Trump of Watertown, Massachusetts; the late Christine Philp of New London, New Hampshire; and Karen Ingraham of Los Alamos, New Mexico; and six grandchildren. His nephew is Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States.  Awards and honors Trump received a number of awards including: 1947: The King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom , given by George VI 1948: The President's Certificate of Merit, presented by Harry S. Truman 1960: The Lamme Medal, given by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers 1983: The National Medal of Science, presented by Ronald Reagan for Engineering Sciences  References",

            "text": "John Pierpont Morgan Sr. was an American financier and investment banker who dominated corporate finance on Wall Street throughout the Gilded Age. As the head of the banking firm that ultimately became known as J.P. Morgan and Co., he was the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the United States spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over the course of his career on Wall Street, J.P. Morgan spearheaded the formation of several prominent multinational corporations including U.S. Steel, International Harvester and General Electric which subsequently fell under his supervision. He and his partners also held controlling interests in numerous other American businesses including Aetna, Western Union, Pullman Car Company and 21 railroads. Due to the extent of his dominance over U.S. finance, Morgan exercised enormous influence over the nation's policies and the market forces underlying its economy. During the Panic of 1907, he organized a coalition of financiers that saved the American monetary system from collapse. As the Progressive Era's leading financier, J.P. Morgan's dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform the shape of the American economy. Adrian Wooldridge characterized Morgan as America's greatest banker . Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan Jr. Biographer Ron Chernow estimated his fortune at 80 million .  Childhood and education Morgan was born and raised in Hartford, Connecticut, to Junius Spencer Morgan and Juliet Pierpont of the influential Morgan family. Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to his father's plans. In the fall of 1848, he transferred to the Hartford Public School, then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut , where he boarded with the principal. In September 1851, he passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, which specialized in mathematics for careers in commerce. In April 1852, an illness struck Morgan which became more common as his life progressed: Rheumatic fever left him in such pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to Boston to resume his studies. After graduation, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school in the Swiss village of La Tour de Peilz, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of G ttingen to improve his German. He attained passable fluency within six months, and a degree in art history; then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, his formal education complete.  Career   Early years and life  Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at 3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for 22 each. Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute 300 to take his place. From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed J.S. Morgan Co. upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864 to 1872, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, Anthony J. Drexel founded the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan Company with his apprentice Pierpont.  J.P. Morgan Company  After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened J. P. Morgan Company in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan Company of London. By 1900 it was one of the world's most powerful banking houses, focused primarily on reorganizations and consolidations.Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge. He often took over troubled business and reorganized their structures and management to return them to profitability, a process that became known as Morganization . His reputation as a banker and financier drew interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.  Railroads  In his ascent to power, Morgan focused on railroads, America's largest business enterprises. He wrested control of the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad from Jay Gould and Jim Fisk in 1869; led the syndicate that broke the government financing privileges of Jay Cooke; and developed and financed a railroad empire by reorganization and consolidation in all parts of the United States. He raised large sums in Europe; but rather than participating solely as a financier, he helped the railroads reorganize and achieve greater efficiency. He fought speculators interested only in profit and built a vision of an integrated transportation system. He successfully marketed a large part of William H. Vanderbilt's New York Central holdings in 1883. In 1885 he reorganized the New York, West Shore Buffalo Railroad, leasing it to the New York Central. In 1886 he reorganized the Philadelphia Reading, and in 1888 the Chesapeake Ohio. After Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, Morgan set up conferences in 1889 and 1890 that brought together railroad presidents to help the industry follow the new laws and write agreements for the maintenance of public, reasonable, uniform and stable rates . The first of their kind, the conferences created a community of interest among competing lines, paving the way for the great consolidations of the early 20th century. In addition, J P Morgan Co, and the banking houses which it succeeded, reorganized a large number of railroads between 1869 and 1899. Morgan also financed street railways, especially in New York City.A major political debacle came in 1904. The Northern Pacific Railway went bankrupt in the great depression of 1893. The bankruptcy wiped out the railroad's bondholders, leaving it free of debt, and a complex financial battle for its control ensued. In 1901, a compromise was reached between Morgan, New York financier E. H. Harriman and St. Paul, MN railroad builder James J. Hill. To reduce expensive competition in the Midwest, they created the Northern Securities Company to consolidate the operations of three of the region's most important railways: the Northern Pacific Railway, the Great Northern Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The consolidators ran into unexpected opposition, however, from President Theodore Roosevelt. An energetic trustbuster, Roosevelt considered the giant merger bad for consumers and a violation of the seldom enforced Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1902, Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue to break it up. In 1904 the Supreme Court dissolved the Northern Security company and the railroads had to go their separate, competitive ways. Morgan did not lose money on the project, but his all powerful political reputation suffered.  Treasury gold  The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he claimed the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30 year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re elected in 1900.  Steel  After his father's death in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan Co. . He began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900, with the goal of buying Carnegie's steel business and merging it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses , forming the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901, U.S. Steel was the world's first billion dollar company, with an authorized capitalization of 1.4 billion, much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads. U.S. Steel's goals were to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed the company's size would enable it to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets . U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as it sought to dominate not only steel but the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and many other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan captured two thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 market share. However, after 1901, its market share dropped; and in 1903, Schwab resigned to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer. Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, used aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro union troublemakers . The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger including Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary were more concerned with long range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a paternalistic labor policy.   Panic of 1907  The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis. Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked 35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks. Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over 6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel, owning valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel; he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid 30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.Vowing never to let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  Banking's critics  While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected. Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of 22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty two states west of the Mississippi River.  Unsuccessful ventures Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.  Nikola Tesla  In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans Atlantic wireless communication system that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla 150,000 to build the system in return for a 51 control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system. Morgan considered Tesla's changes a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, and never became operational.  London Underground  Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to build and operate a line on the London Underground. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with tube lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of .  International Mercantile Marine  In 1902, J.P. Morgan Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company , an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.  Morgan corporations From 1890 to 1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.  Manufacturing and construction industry   Railroads   Later years  Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York. He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of 125,000, and commanded Stanford White to ...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense... He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.  Personal life   Marriages and children  In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi . He married Frances Louisa Fanny Tracy , on May 31, 1865. They had four children: Louisa Pierpont Morgan , who married Herbert L. Satterlee J. P. Morgan Jr. , who married Jane Norton Grew Juliet Pierpont Morgan , who married William Pierson Hamilton Anne Tracy Morgan , philanthropist  Appearance  Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling as if a gale had blown through the house. He was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose. He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed without his permission; as a result of his self consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched. His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue. Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child he suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son in law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.His social and professional self confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.  Religion  Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders. He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan. In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their faith and order. Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed 100,000 to finance the commission's work.  Homes  His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882. It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878. It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned the Cragston estate, located in Highland Falls, New York. His son, of the same name, was the owner of East Island in Glen Cove, New York.J.P. Morgan spent three months of every year in London and owned two houses there. His 'town' house, 13 Prince's Gate was inherited from his father and was later expanded by the acquisition of the neighbouring Number 14 to house his growing art collection. After his death the merged houses were offered to the US government for use as the residence of the US Ambassador, from 1929 to 1955. His other property was Dover House, Putney, which was later demolished and developed into the Dover House Estate.  Yachting  An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts, the first being the Corsair, built by William Cramp Sons for Charles J. Osborn and launched on May 26, 1880. Charles J. Osborn was Jay Gould's private banker. Morgan bought the yacht in 1882. The well known quote, If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed. A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix les Bains, France. The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said: Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death.  Collector  Morgan was a collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. For a number of years the British artist and art critic Roger Fry worked for the museum, and in effect for Morgan, as a collector.His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.  Benefactor  Morgan was a benefactor of the Morgan Library and Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, Groton School, Harvard University , Trinity College, the Lying in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.  Gem collector  By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones . Tiffany Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where they were known as the Morgan Tiffany and the Morgan Bement collections. In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer morganite.  Photography  Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis 75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians. Curtis eventually published a 20 volume work entitled The North American Indian. Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters , which was restored in 1974 and re released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.  Other  Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.  Death  Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome, Italy. His body was brought back to America aboard the SS France, a French Line passenger ship. Flags on Wall Street flew at half staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City. His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont Jack Morgan Jr., inherited the banking business. He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library Museum in New York. His estate was worth 68.3 million , of which about 30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at 50 million.  Legacy His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass Steagall Act, the House of Morgan became three entities: J.P. Morgan Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house. The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  Popular culture A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy. Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist, in E. L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime, in Steven S. Drachman's novel The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh, in Graham Moore's novel The Last Days of Night, and in Marie Bendedict and Victoria Christopher Murray's novel, The Personal Librarian.Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher , guardian of the young Citizen Kane with whom he has a tense relationship Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood. According to Phil Orbanes, former vice president of Parker Brothers, the Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.The family of the illustrator Daniel Fox, who in 1936 created the mascot for the game, have accredited J. P. Morgan as being the inspiration for the character. Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America. My Name Is Morgan  1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Originally released as a coon song but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.

            "text": "Francis David Peat was a holistic physicist and author who has carried out research in solid state physics and the foundation of quantum theory. He was director of the Pari Center for New Learning, which is located in the village of Pari near Grosseto in Tuscany, Italy. He was adjunct professor at the California Institute of Integral Studies and Schumacher College, a Fellow of the World Academy of Art and Science and a Distinguished Fellow at the University of South Africa.  Education and career In 1964, Peat received a PhD in physics from the University of Liverpool. In 1965, he became assistant professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Subsequently, from 1967 to 1975, he worked as research scientist for the National Research Council of Canada. During this time, from 1971 to 1972, he performed a sabbatical study with David Bohm and Roger Penrose at Birkbeck College in London.For many years he was associated with physicist and philosopher David Bohm; the two wrote the book Science, Order, and Creativity together, and Peat later wrote Bohm's biography, Infinite Potential: The Life and Times of David Bohm. In the context of this biography, Peat emphasized how Bohm had worked intensely on finding a mathematical expression for his vision of an interconnected, enfolded implicate order, from which an explicate order, the world of classical physics unfolds. Bohm also aimed at re introducing time as a dynamic entity. According to Peat, the use of the term Bohmian mechanics for his theory would have shocked Dave Bohm somewhat : what was happening with the ideas of Bohm's and Hiley's theory, similarly as what had occurred with those of Grassman, Hamilton and Clifford before, was that physicists left the fundamental ideas aside and merely made use of them as an easy manner of performing calculations.While living in Canada, Peat organized discussion circles between Western scientists and Native American elders, together with Leroy Little Bear who later obtained the 2003 National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, for Education. While living in London, Peat organized a conference between artists and scientists. In 1996 he moved from Canada to Pari, Italy.In 2000, he founded the Pari Center for New Learning, a center dedicated to education, learning and research, together with writer and researcher Maureen Doolan. The activities of the Pari Center comprise residential courses and conferences and possibilities for scholars and researchers to spend extended periods as residents in Pari.Peat wrote on the subjects of science, art, and spirituality and proposed the notions of creative suspension and gentle action. He authored or co authored many books including Synchronicity: The Bridge between Matter and Mind, Seven Life Lessons of Chaos, Turbulent Mirror, Gentle Action, and Pathways of Chance. His most recent book was A Flickering Reality: Cinema and the Nature of Reality.  Gentle Action A focus of Peat's recent work was the concept of gentle action. This approach, as envisaged by Peat, emphasizes a certain manner of action that is aimed at creating change in an effective manner. The approach calls for tolerating uncertainty yet suspending action at its onset in order to allow an overall view to emerge. It emphasizes the value of small scale, iterative actions compared to large, single step interventions. In his book of the same name, published 2008, Peat points out connections of his approach to earlier concepts, emphasizing the importance of active listening and a similarity to the concept of Wu wei. Peat's gentle action has been cited together with Otto Scharmer's Theory U and Arnold Mindell's worldwork as approaches by which individuals, groups, organisations and communities can deal with complex issues.Learning modules based on Peat's gentle action approach have been put in place, among others, at the University of Minnesota and at Siena Heights University.

            "text": "A commutator is a rotary electrical switch in certain types of electric motors and electrical generators that periodically reverses the current direction between the rotor and the external circuit. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the rotating armature of the machine. Two or more electrical contacts called brushes made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator, making sliding contact with successive segments of the commutator as it rotates. The windings on the armature are connected to the commutator segments. Commutators are used in direct current machines: dynamos and many DC motors as well as universal motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady rotating force is produced. In a generator the commutator picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing the direction of the current with each half turn, serving as a mechanical rectifier to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit. The first direct current commutator type machine, the dynamo, was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, based on a suggestion by Andr Marie Amp re. Commutators are relatively inefficient, and also require periodic maintenance such as brush replacement. Therefore, commutated machines are declining in use, being replaced by alternating current machines, and in recent years by brushless DC motors which use semiconductor switches.  Principle of operation  A commutator consists of a set of contact bars fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single armature winding, when the shaft has made one half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the armature winding through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and generator case, the commutator periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.  Simplest practical commutator  Practical commutators have at least three contact segments, to prevent a dead spot where two brushes simultaneously bridge only two commutator segments. Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop in a position where two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de energizes one of the rotor arms while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining rotor arms, a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.  Ring segment construction  A commutator consists of a set of copper segments, fixed around the part of the circumference of the rotating machine, or the rotor, and a set of spring loaded brushes fixed to the stationary frame of the machine. Two or more fixed brushes connect to the external circuit, either a source of current for a motor or a load for a generator. Commutator segments are connected to the coils of the armature, with the number of coils depending on the speed and voltage of the machine. Large motors may have hundreds of segments. Each conducting segment of the commutator is insulated from adjacent segments. Mica was used on early machines and is still used on large machines. Many other insulating materials are used to insulate smaller machines; plastics allow quick manufacture of an insulator, for example. The segments are held onto the shaft using a dovetail shape on the edges or underside of each segment. Insulating wedges around the perimeter of each segment are pressed so that the commutator maintains its mechanical stability throughout its normal operating range. In small appliance and tool motors the segments are typically crimped permanently in place and cannot be removed. When the motor fails it is discarded and replaced. On large industrial machines it is economical to replace individual damaged segments, and so the end wedge can be unscrewed and individual segments removed and replaced. Replacing the copper and mica segments is commonly referred to as refilling . Refillable dovetailed commutators are the most common construction of larger industrial type commutators, but refillable commutators may also be constructed using external bands made of fiberglass or forged steel rings . Disposable, molded type commutators commonly found in smaller DC motors are becoming increasingly more common in larger electric motors. Molded type commutators are not repairable and must be replaced if damaged. In addition to the commonly used heat, torque, and tonnage methods of seasoning commutators, some high performance commutator applications require a more expensive, specific spin seasoning process or over speed spin testing to guarantee stability of the individual segments and prevent premature wear of the carbon brushes. Such requirements are common with traction, military, aerospace, nuclear, mining, and high speed applications where clamping failure and segment or insulation protrusion can lead to serious negative consequences. Friction between the segments and the brushes eventually causes wear to both surfaces. Carbon brushes, being made of a softer material, wear faster and may be designed to be replaced easily without dismantling the machine. Older copper brushes caused more wear to the commutator, causing deep grooving and notching of the surface over time. The commutator on small motors is not designed to be repaired through the life of the device. On large industrial equipment, the commutator may be re surfaced with abrasives, or the rotor may be removed from the frame, mounted in a large metal lathe, and the commutator resurfaced by cutting it down to a smaller diameter. The largest of equipment can include a lathe turning attachment directly over the commutator.  Brush construction  Early machines used brushes made from strands of copper wire to contact the surface of the commutator. However, these hard metal brushes tended to scratch and groove the smooth commutator segments, eventually requiring resurfacing of the commutator. As the copper brushes wore away, the dust and pieces of the brush could wedge between commutator segments, shorting them and reducing the efficiency of the device. Fine copper wire mesh or gauze provided better surface contact with less segment wear, but gauze brushes were more expensive than strip or wire copper brushes. Modern rotating machines with commutators almost exclusively use carbon brushes, which may have copper powder mixed in to improve conductivity. Metallic copper brushes can be found in toy or very small motors, such as the one illustrated above, and some motors which only operate very intermittently, such as automotive starter motors. Motors and generators suffer from a phenomenon known as 'armature reaction', one of the effects of which is to change the position at which the current reversal through the windings should ideally take place as the loading varies. Early machines had the brushes mounted on a ring that was provided with a handle. During operation, it was necessary to adjust the position of the brush ring to adjust the commutation to minimise the sparking at the brushes. This process was known as 'rocking the brushes'. Various developments took place to automate the process of adjusting the commutation and minimizing the sparking at the brushes. One of these was the development of 'high resistance brushes', or brushes made from a mixture of copper powder and carbon. Although described as high resistance brushes, the resistance of such a brush was of the order of milliohms, the exact value dependent on the size and function of the machine. Also, the high resistance brush was not constructed like a brush but in the form of a carbon block with a curved face to match the shape of the commutator. The high resistance or carbon brush is made large enough that it is significantly wider than the insulating segment that it spans . The result of this is that as the commutator segment passes from under the brush, the current passing to it ramps down more smoothly than had been the case with pure copper brushes where the contact broke suddenly. Similarly the segment coming into contact with the brush has a similar ramping up of the current. Thus, although the current passing through the brush was more or less constant, the instantaneous current passing to the two commutator segments was proportional to the relative area in contact with the brush. The introduction of the carbon brush had convenient side effects. Carbon brushes tend to wear more evenly than copper brushes, and the soft carbon causes far less damage to the commutator segments. There is less sparking with carbon as compared to copper, and as the carbon wears away, the higher resistance of carbon results in fewer problems from the dust collecting on the commutator segments. The ratio of copper to carbon can be changed for a particular purpose. Brushes with higher copper content perform better with very low voltages and high current, while brushes with a higher carbon content are better for high voltage and low current. High copper content brushes typically carry 150 to 200 amperes per square inch of contact surface, while higher carbon content only carries 40 to 70 amperes per square inch. The higher resistance of carbon also results in a greater voltage drop of 0.8 to 1.0 volts per contact, or 1.6 to 2.0 volts across the commutator.  Brush holders  A spring is typically used with the brush, to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the brush and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the brush downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the brush wears small and thin enough that steady contact is no longer possible or it is no longer securely held in the brush holder, and so the brush must be replaced. It is common for a flexible power cable to be directly attached to the brush, because current flowing through the support spring would cause heating, which may lead to a loss of metal temper and a loss of the spring tension. When a commutated motor or generator uses more power than a single brush is capable of conducting, an assembly of several brush holders is mounted in parallel across the surface of the very large commutator. This parallel holder distributes current evenly across all the brushes, and permits a careful operator to remove a bad brush and replace it with a new one, even as the machine continues to spin fully powered and under load. High power, high current commutated equipment is now uncommon, due to the less complex design of alternating current generators that permits a low current, high voltage spinning field coil to energize high current fixed position stator coils. This permits the use of very small singular brushes in the alternator design. In this instance, the rotating contacts are continuous rings, called slip rings, and no switching happens. Modern devices using carbon brushes usually have a maintenance free design that requires no adjustment throughout the life of the device, using a fixed position brush holder slot and a combined brush spring cable assembly that fits into the slot. The worn brush is pulled out and a new brush inserted.  Brush contact angle  The different brush types make contact with the commutator in different ways. Because copper brushes have the same hardness as the commutator segments, the rotor cannot be spun backwards against the ends of copper brushes without the copper digging into the segments and causing severe damage. Consequently, strip laminate copper brushes only make tangential contact with the commutator, while copper mesh and wire brushes use an inclined contact angle touching their edge across the segments of a commutator that can spin in only one direction. The softness of carbon brushes permits direct radial end contact with the commutator without damage to the segments, permitting easy reversal of rotor direction, without the need to reorient the brush holders for operation in the opposite direction. Although never reversed, common appliance motors that use wound rotors, commutators and brushes have radial contact brushes. In the case of a reaction type carbon brush holder, carbon brushes may be reversely inclined with the commutator so that the commutator tends to push against the carbon for firm contact.  The commutating plane  The contact point where a brush touches the commutator is referred to as the commutating plane. To conduct sufficient current to or from the commutator, the brush contact area is not a thin line but instead a rectangular patch across the segments. Typically the brush is wide enough to span 2.5 commutator segments. This means that two adjacent segments are electrically connected by the brush when it contacts both.  Rotation of brushes for stator field distortion  Most introductions to motor and generator design start with a simple two pole device with the brushes arranged at a perfect 90 degree angle from the field. This ideal is useful as a starting point for understanding how the fields interact but it is not how a motor or generator functions in actual practice. In a real motor or generator, the field around the rotor is never perfectly uniform. Instead, the rotation of the rotor induces field effects which drag and distort the magnetic lines of the outer non rotating stator. The faster the rotor spins, the further this degree of field distortion. Because a motor or generator operates most efficiently with the rotor field at right angles to the stator field, it is necessary to either retard or advance the brush position to put the rotor's field into the correct position to be at a right angle to the distorted field. These field effects are reversed when the direction of spin is reversed. It is therefore difficult to build an efficient reversible commutated dynamo, since for highest field strength it is necessary to move the brushes to the opposite side of the normal neutral plane. These effects can be mitigated by a compensation winding in the face of the field pole that carries armature current. The effect can be considered to be analogous to timing advance in an internal combustion engine. Generally a dynamo that has been designed to run at a certain fixed speed will have its brushes permanently fixed to align the field for highest efficiency at that speed.  Further compensation for self induction  Self induction The magnetic fields in each coil of wire join and compound together to create a magnetic field that resists changes in the current, which can be likened to the current having inertia. In the coils of the rotor, even after the brush has been reached, currents tend to continue to flow for a brief moment, resulting in a wasted energy as heat due to the brush spanning across several commutator segments and the current short circuiting across the segments. Spurious resistance is an apparent increase in the resistance in the armature winding, which is proportional to the speed of the armature, and is due to the lagging of the current. To minimize sparking at the brushes due to this short circuiting, the brushes are advanced a few degrees further yet, beyond the advance for field distortions. This moves the rotor winding undergoing commutation slightly forward into the stator field which has magnetic lines in the opposite direction and which oppose the field in the stator. This opposing field helps to reverse the lagging self inducting current in the stator. So even for a rotor which is at rest and initially requires no compensation for spinning field distortions, the brushes should still be advanced beyond the perfect 90 degree angle as taught in so many beginners textbooks, to compensate for self induction.  Use of interpoles to correct field distortions  Modern motor and generator devices with commutators are able to counteract armature reaction through the use of interpoles, which are small field coils and pole pieces positioned approximately halfway between the primary poles of the stator. By applying a dynamic varying field to the interpoles as the load, RPM, or direction of rotation of the device changes, it is possible to balance out field distortions from armature reaction so that the brush position can remain fixed and sparking across the segments is minimized.  Limitations and alternatives  Although direct current motors and dynamos once dominated industry, the disadvantages of the commutator have caused a decline in the use of commutated machines in the last century. These disadvantages are: The sliding friction between the brushes and commutator consumes power, which can be significant in a low power machine. Due to friction, the brushes and copper commutator segments wear down, creating dust. In small consumer products such as power tools and appliances the brushes may last as long as the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of brushes and occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in low particulate or sealed applications or in equipment that must operate for long periods without maintenance. The resistance of the sliding contact between brush and commutator causes a voltage drop called the brush drop . This may be several volts, so it can cause large power losses in low voltage, high current machines. Alternating current motors, which do not use commutators, are much more efficient. There is a limit to the maximum current density and voltage which can be switched with a commutator. Very large direct current machines, say, more than several megawatts rating, cannot be built with commutators. The largest motors and generators are all alternating current machines. The switching action of the commutator causes sparking at the contacts, posing a fire hazard in explosive atmospheres, and generating electromagnetic interference.With the wide availability of alternating current, DC motors have been replaced by more efficient AC synchronous or induction motors. In recent years, with the widespread availability of power semiconductors, in many remaining applications commutated DC motors have been replaced with brushless direct current motors . These don't have a commutator; instead the direction of the current is switched electronically. A sensor keeps track of the rotor position and semiconductor switches such as transistors reverse the current. Operating life of these machines is much longer, limited mainly by bearing wear.  Repulsion induction motors  These are single phase AC only motors with higher starting torque than could be obtained with split phase starting windings, before high capacitance starting capacitors became practical. They have a conventional wound stator as with any induction motor, but the wire wound rotor is much like that with a conventional commutator. Brushes opposite each other are connected to each other , and transformer action induces currents into the rotor that develop torque by repulsion. One variety, notable for having an adjustable speed, runs continuously with brushes in contact, while another uses repulsion only for high starting torque and in some cases lifts the brushes once the motor is running fast enough. In the latter case, all commutator segments are connected together as well, before the motor attains running speed. Once at speed, the rotor windings become functionally equivalent to the squirrel cage structure of a conventional induction motor, and the motor runs as such.  Laboratory commutators Commutators were used as simple forward off reverse switches for electrical experiments in physics laboratories. There are two well known historical types:  Ruhmkorff commutator  This is similar in design to the commutators used in motors and dynamos. It was usually constructed of brass and ivory .  Pohl commutator  This consisted of a block of wood or ebonite with four wells, containing mercury, which were cross connected by copper wires. The output was taken from a pair of curved copper wires which were moved to dip into one or other pair of mercury wells. Instead of mercury, ionic liquids or other liquid metals could be used.

            "text": "Plasma lamps are a type of electrodeless gas discharge lamp energized by radio frequency power. They are distinct from the novelty plasma lamps that were popular in the 1980s. The internal electrodeless lamp was invented by Nikola Tesla after his experimentation with high frequency currents in evacuated glass tubes for the purposes of lighting and the study of high voltage phenomena. The first practical plasma lamps were the sulfur lamps manufactured by Fusion Lighting. This lamp suffered several practical problems and did not prosper commercially. Plasma lamps with an internal phosphor coating are called external electrode fluorescent lamps ; these external electrodes or terminal conductors provide the radio frequency electric field.  Description Modern plasma lamps are a family of light sources that generate light by exciting plasma inside a closed transparent burner or bulb using radio frequency power. Typically, such lamps use a noble gas or a mixture of these gases and additional materials such as metal halides, sodium, mercury or sulfur. In modern plasma lamps, a waveguide is used to constrain and focus the electrical field into the plasma. In operation, the gas is ionized, and free electrons, accelerated by the electrical field, collide with gas and metal atoms. Some atomic electrons circling around the gas and metal atoms are excited by these collisions, bringing them to a higher energy state. When the electron falls back to its original state, it emits a photon, resulting in visible light or ultraviolet radiation, depending on the fill materials. The first commercial plasma lamp was an ultraviolet curing lamp with a bulb filled with argon and mercury vapor developed by Fusion UV. That lamp led Fusion Lighting to the development of the sulfur lamp, a bulb filled with argon and sulfur that is bombarded with microwaves through a hollow waveguide. The bulb had to be spun rapidly to prevent it from burning through. Fusion Lighting did not prosper commercially, but other manufacturers continue to pursue sulfur lamps. Sulfur lamps, though relatively efficient, have had several problems, chiefly: Limited life Magnetrons had limited lives. Large size Heat The sulfur burnt through the bulb wall unless they were rotated rapidly. High power demand They could not sustain a plasma in powers under 1000 W.  Limited life  In the past, the life of the plasma lamps was limited by the magnetron used to generate the microwaves. Solid state RF chips can be used and give long lives. However, using solid state chips to generate RF is currently an order of magnitude more expensive than using a magnetron and so only appropriate for high value lighting niches. It has recently been shown by Dipolar 1 of Sweden to be possible to extend the life of magnetrons to over 40,000 hours, making low cost plasma lamps possible.  Heat and power  The use of a high dielectric waveguide allowed the sustaining of plasmas at much lower powers down to 100 W in some instances. It also allowed the use of conventional gas discharge lamp fill materials which removed the need to spin the bulb. The only issue with the ceramic waveguide was that much of the light generated by the plasma was trapped inside the opaque ceramic waveguide.  High efficiency plasma  High efficiency plasma lighting is the class of plasma lamps that have system efficiencies of 90 lumens per watt or more. Lamps in this class are potentially the most energy efficient light source for outdoor, commercial, and industrial lighting. This is due not only to their high system efficiency but also to the small light source they present enabling very high luminaire efficiency. Luminaire Efficacy Rating is the single figure of merit the National Electrical Manufacturers Association has defined to help address problems with lighting manufacturers' efficiency claims and is designed to allow robust comparison between lighting types. It is given by the product of luminaire efficiency times total rated lamp output in lumens times ballast factor , divided by the input power in watts : LER EFF TLL BF IPThe system efficiency for a high efficiency plasma lamp is given by the last three variables, that is, it excludes the luminaire efficiency. Though plasma lamps do not have a ballast, they have an RF power supply that fulfills the equivalent function. In electrodeless lamps, the inclusion of the electrical losses, or ballast factor , in lumens per watt claimed can be particularly significant as the conversion of electrical power to radio frequency power can be a highly inefficient process. Many modern plasma lamps have very small light sources far smaller than HID bulbs or fluorescent tubes leading to much higher luminaire efficiencies also. High intensity discharge lamps have typical luminaire efficiencies of 55 , and fluorescent lamps of 70 . Plasma lamps typically have luminaire efficiencies exceeding 90 .  Applications Plasma lamps have been used in high bay and street lighting applications, as well as in stage lighting. They were briefly used in some projection televisions.

            "text": "Tesla's Egg of Columbus was a device exhibited in the Westinghouse Electric display at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition to explain the rotating magnetic field that drove the new alternating current induction motors designed by inventor Nikola Tesla by using that magnetic field to spin a copper egg on end.  Origins At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate and gave his devices their own exhibit space. The display demonstrated a series of electrical effects related to alternating current, AC generators, and displayed many types of induction motors and explained the rotating magnetic field that drove them. With the fair celebrating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World, the Egg of Columbus exhibit, building on the apocryphal 15th century story of the Egg of Columbus , is described as going one better by using a magnetic field to stand an egg on end. It presented the viewer with a flat round wooden surface surrounded by a wooden rim. Inside this rim it performed Christopher Columbus's feat by spinning a copper egg, larger than an ostrich egg, in a rotating magnetic field causing it to stand on end on its major axis due to gyroscopic action. The display also included round copper balls that seemed to orbit around the edge similar to the way planets move. Whenever the large rotating magnetic field set up by the Egg of Columbus was turned on it impressed the public by spinning various magnetized metal balls and painted metal disks on the display table and even small disks inside vacuum bulbs placed at some distance around the Electricity Building.Underneath what the public saw was a toroidal iron core stator on which four electromagnetic coils were wound. The device was powered by a two phase alternating current source to create the rotating magnetic field. The device operated on a frequency of 25 to 300 hertz. The ideal operating frequency was described as being between 35 and 40 hertz. The device has been described as being built by Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott, who was in charge of development of the induction motor for the company, although a March 1919 Electrical Experimenter article claimed it was built by Westinghouse Electric Superintendent Albert Schmid.The Columbian Exposition Egg of Columbus ended up at Tesla's 46 48 East Houston Street New York City laboratory where he would demonstrate it to visitors. Margaret Cheney's 1981 book Tesla: Man Out of Time says that after Tesla's death the device was sent to Yugoslavia 1952 along with many other Tesla papers, models and artifacts, becoming part of the collection at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade although her later 1999 book Tesla: Master of Lightning seems to indicate that the museum has only a smaller copy.  Alternative origin  An alternative origin for Tesla's Egg of Columbus was told by Nikola Tesla himself to the editors of Electrical Experimenter and published in their March, 1919 article How Tesla Performed the Feat of Columbus Without Cracking the Egg . In this version the year of invention was 1887 when He had approached a Wall Street capitalist a prominent lawyer with a view of getting financial support and this gentleman called in a friend of his, a well known engineer at the head of one of the big corporations in New York, to pass upon the merits of the scheme . At that time these would have been Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, Tesla's financial backers and partners in the Tesla Electric Company. Tesla's story has him convincing these men that a rotating magnetic field AC induction motor would be a feasible invention worth developing via building the Egg of Columbus the next day and demonstrating it to them.  Reproductions Reproductions of the device are displayed at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, the Memorial Centre Nikola Tesla in Smiljan, the Technical Museum in Zagreb, the Croatian History Museum in Zagreb, in the Ann Arbor Hands On Museum in Ann Arbor, MI, and the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in Shoreham, NY.

            "text": "The Westinghouse Electric Corporation was an American manufacturing company founded in 1886 by George Westinghouse. It was originally named Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company , and was renamed Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1945. The company acquired the CBS television network in 1995, and was renamed CBS Corporation , until being acquired by Viacom in 1999. That merger was completed on April 26, 2000. The CBS Corporation name was later reused for one of the two companies resulting from the split of Viacom in 2006. The Westinghouse trademarks are owned by Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which does business as Westinghouse Licensing Corporation. The nuclear power business, Westinghouse Electric Company, was spun off from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1999.  History  Westinghouse Electric was founded by George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886. The firm became active in developing electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The company's largest factories were located in East Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, and Lester, Pennsylvania and in Hamilton, Ontario, where they made turbines, generators, motors, and switch gear for generation, transmission, and use of electricity. In addition to George Westinghouse, early engineers working for the company included Frank Conrad, Benjamin Garver Lamme, Bertha Lamme , Oliver B. Shallenberger, William Stanley, Nikola Tesla, Stephen Timoshenko and Vladimir Zworykin. Early on, Westinghouse was a rival to Thomas Edison's electric company. In 1892, Edison was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson Houston Electric Company, making an even bigger competitor, General Electric. Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company changed its name to Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1945.  Financial catastrophe and corporate reinvention   CBS Corporation  In 1990, Westinghouse experienced a financial catastrophe when the Corporation lost over one billion dollars due to bad high risk, high fee, high interest loans made by its Westinghouse Credit Corporation lending arm.Westinghouse purchased CBS Inc. in 1995, for 5.4 billion. Westinghouse Electric Corporation changed its name to and became the original CBS Corporation in 1997. Also in 1997, the Power Generation Business Unit, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, was sold to Siemens AG, of Germany. A year later, CBS sold all of its commercial nuclear power businesses to British Nuclear Fuels Limited . In connection with that sale, certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Company. That company was sold to Toshiba in 2006.In an attempt to revitalize the corporation, the Board of Directors appointed outside management in the form of CEO Michael H. Jordan, who brought in numerous consultants to help re engineer the company in order to realize the potential that they saw in the broadcasting industry. Westinghouse reduced the workforce in many of its traditional industrial operations and made further acquisitions in broadcasting to add to its already substantial Group W network, purchasing CBS in 1995. Shortly after, Westinghouse purchased Infinity Broadcasting, TNN, CMT, American Radio Systems, and rights to NFL broadcasting. These investments cost the company over fifteen billion dollars. To recoup its costs, Westinghouse sold many other operations. Siemens purchased its non nuclear power generation division, while other firms bought its defense electronics division, its metering and load control division , its residential security division, the office furniture company Knoll, and Thermo King. With little remaining of the company other than its broadcasting division, Westinghouse renamed itself CBS Corporation in 1997.  Patents During the 20th century, Westinghouse engineers and scientists were granted more than 28,000 U.S. patents, the third most of any company.  Products and sponsorships Power generation: The company pioneered the power generation industry and in the fields of long distance power transmission and high voltage alternating current transmission, unveiling the technology for lighting in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Steam turbine generator: The first commercial Westinghouse steam turbine driven generator, a 1,500 kW unit, began operation at Hartford Electric Light Co. in 1901. The machine, nicknamed Mary Ann, was the first steam turbine generator to be installed by an electric utility to generate electricity in the US. George Westinghouse had based his original steam turbine design on designs licensed from the English inventor Charles Parsons. Today a large proportion of steam turbine generators operating around the world, ranging to units as large as 1,500 MW were supplied by Westinghouse from its factories in Lester, Pennsylvania; Charlotte, North Carolina; or Hamilton, Ont. or were built overseas under Westinghouse license. Major Westinghouse licensees or joint venture partners included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and Harbin Turbine Co. and Shanghai Electric Co. of China. Research: Westinghouse had 50,000 employees by 1900, and established a formal research and development department in 1906. While the company was expanding, it would experience internal financial difficulties. During the Panic of 1907, the Board of Directors forced George Westinghouse to take a six month leave of absence. Westinghouse officially retired in 1909 and died several years later in 1914. Electrical technology: Under new leadership, Westinghouse Electric diversified its business activities in electrical technology. It acquired the Copeman Electric Stove Company in 1914 and Pittsburgh High Voltage Insulator Company in 1921. Westinghouse also moved into radio broadcasting by establishing Pittsburgh's KDKA, the first commercial radio station, and WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1921. Westinghouse expanded into the elevator business, establishing the Westinghouse Elevator Company in 1928; it sold its elevator business to Schindler Group in 1989. Throughout the decade, diversification engendered considerable growth; sales went from 43 million in 1914 to 216 million in 1929. Aviation: Westinghouse produced the first operational American turbojet for the US Navy program in 1943. After many successes, the ill fated J40 project, started soon after World War Two, was abandoned in 1955 and led to Westinghouse exiting the aircraft engine business with closure of the Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division in 1960. Gas turbines: During the late 1940s Westinghouse applied its aviation gas turbine technology and experience to develop its first industrial gas turbine. A 2,000 horsepower model W21 was installed in 1948 at the Mississippi River Fuel Corp gas compression station in Wilmar, Arkansas. This was the beginning of a 50 year history of Westinghouse industrial and utility gas turbine development, prior to the sale by Westinghouse of the power generation business to Siemens, AG in 1998. Evolving from the Small Steam and Gas Turbine Division formed in the early 1950s, the Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division was located in Concordville, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia and the old Lester, Pennsylvania plant, until it was relocated to Power Generation headquarters in Orlando, Florida in 1987. Nuclear power: As a result of its participation in the US government's military program for nuclear energy applications Westinghouse was instrumental in the development and commercialization of nuclear energy systems for electric power generation. This business currently operates as the Westinghouse Electric Company, and is owned by Brookfield Business Partners of Canada. Electricite de France a major global player in the nuclear power business, was a long time licensee of the Westinghouse nuclear technology. Industrial motors: Additional major industrial products in the widespread Westinghouse portfolio included electric motors of all sizes, elevators and escalators, controls and lighting. The Large Motor Division, once headquartered in Buffalo, NY, entered a joint venture with Taiwan Electric Co. in the 1970s and today operates as TECO Westinghouse. Much of Westinghouse's higher voltage power equipment was sold to ABB in 1989 and renamed the ABB Power T D Company. Rail transit: The Westinghouse Transportation Division supplied equipment and controls for many North American interurban and streetcar lines, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit , Washington DC METRO , New York City Subway equipment from the 1890s elevated era to the R68A in 1988, among many other heavy rail and rail transit systems and built locomotives, often in partnership with Baldwin, Lima Hamilton as well as supplying electrical and traction equipment for Fairbanks Morse diesel locomotives. The division designed and built Automated People Movers at several major U.S. airports, including Sea Tac. Tampa, Dallas Ft. Worth and Orlando. The Transportation Division was sold to AEG of Germany , which merged into a joint venture of ABB and Daimler Benz named AdTranz in 1996. Ultimately, the unit was acquired by Bombardier of Canada in 2001 and is still headquartered in Pittsburgh. Consumer electrics: Westinghouse was also a leader in the design and manufacturing of household electrical products including radios, televisions, and other audio video equipment, and both small and large electric appliances of all kinds, from hair dryers and electric irons to clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators and air conditioning units. For many years Westinghouse was a familiar household name and favored brand. After more than 50 years, and after playing a strong No. 2 to rival General Electric for most of that time, Westinghouse decided to exit the appliance business in the mid 1970s. White Westinghouse was formed when White Consolidated acquired the Westinghouse appliance unit in 1975. World's Fair time capsules: The company is also known for its time capsule contributions during the 1939 New York World's Fair and 1964 New York World's Fair. They also participated in the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. They sponsored the Westinghouse Auditorium at the fair, where they showed films documenting Westinghouse products and company plants. Westinghouse was one of the original corporate sponsors and exhibitors at Walt Disney World's EPCOT attraction in Orlando, Florida.  Environmental incidents There have been a number of Westinghouse related environmental incidents in the US. Below is a short list of these. All of these are chemical pollution incidents; none of them involve nuclear reactors or nuclear pollution. Sharon plant: The Westinghouse Sharon Plant was a 58 acre Westinghouse transformer production facility in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. The EPA's recent Five Year Review Report of this Superfund site determined that the Shenango River has been polluted due to Westinghouse operations in this area. Because of the findings, the state of Pennsylvania has issued a Do Not Eat advisory for fish around the Westinghouse site. This plant was no longer operational after 1984. Westinghouse submitted their final cleanup plan in 1998, and further action beyond their dissolution has been liable to CBS. The transformer business unit was sold to ABB in 1989. This site now houses a product design company. Adams County plant: Westinghouse was fined 5.5 million in 1996 for polluting groundwater in over 100 wells, as well as other water sources, while operating its Westinghouse Elevator Company plant in Adams County, Pennsylvania. Degreasers and other toxic chemicals were released over a 5 year period in the 1980s. This business unit was sold to Schindler in 1988. Future liability for cleanup has been directed to CBS following the dissolution of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1999. Horseheads site: Westinghouse operated a cathode ray tube plant in Horseheads, New York. They were deemed responsible for pollution at the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Superfund site in Horseheads, New York. Westinghouse polluted nearby soil, affecting the safety of a nearby aquifer and wells used by residents. One phase of the cleanup effort describes Westinghouse Electric Corporation's facility, designated Disposal Area F and the Former Runoff Basin Area, which are contaminated with volatile organic compounds , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and arsenic, will be cleaned up using a combination of soil excavation and soil vapor extraction. At Disposal Area F, the area of contamination is about 0.3 acres. At the Former Runoff Basin Area, the contaminated soils cover approximately 0.7 acres. Disposal of the excavated soils occurred at appropriate off site facilities. The removal of the PAHs and arsenic contamination will protect site workers and employees at the Westinghouse facility and the cleanup of the VOCs will help restore the quality of the Newtown Creek Aquifer. In 1986, Westinghouse entered a joint venture at this plant with Toshiba to produce CRTs. In 1989, Toshiba become part owner of this plant and the Westinghouse CRT business unit. Future liability has been shifted to CBS. Sunnyvale plant: Westinghouse operated a plant which manufactured electronics for military systems in Sunnyvale, California. Groundwater and soil near this plant are contaminated with PCBs, fuels, and volatile organic compounds . Potential health threats to area residents include accidentally ingesting or coming into direct contact with site contaminants in soil or groundwater. There are municipal drinking water wells within 1 4 mile from this site, and 300,000 people get their drinking water from within three miles of the site. This business unit was sold to Northrop Grumman in 1996. Future liability for this action has been passed on to CBS.

            "text": "Tesla is the codename for a GPU microarchitecture developed by Nvidia, and released in 2006, as the successor to Curie microarchitecture. It was named after the pioneering electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. As Nvidia's first microarchitecture to implement unified shaders, it was used with GeForce 8 Series, GeForce 9 Series, GeForce 100 Series, GeForce 200 Series, and GeForce 300 Series of GPUs collectively manufactured in 90 nm, 80 nm, 65 nm, 55 nm, and 40 nm. It was also in the GeForce 405 and in the Quadro FX, Quadro x000, Quadro NVS series, and Nvidia Tesla computing modules. Tesla replaced the old fixed pipeline microarchitectures, represented at the time of introduction by the GeForce 7 series. It competed directly with AMD's first unified shader microarchitecture named TeraScale, a development of ATI's work on the Xbox 360 which used a similar design. Tesla was followed by Fermi.  Overview Tesla is Nvidia's first microarchitecture implementing the unified shader model. The driver supports Direct3D 10 Shader Model 4.0 OpenGL 2.1 architecture. The design is a major shift for NVIDIA in GPU functionality and capability, the most obvious change being the move from the separate functional units within previous GPUs to a homogeneous collection of universal floating point processors that can perform a more universal set of tasks. GeForce 8's unified shader architecture consists of a number of stream processors . Unlike the vector processing approach taken with older shader units, each SP is scalar and thus can operate only on one component at a time. This makes them less complex to build while still being quite flexible and universal. Scalar shader units also have the advantage of being more efficient in a number of cases as compared to previous generation vector shader units that rely on ideal instruction mixture and ordering to reach peak throughput. The lower maximum throughput of these scalar processors is compensated for by efficiency and by running them at a high clock speed . GeForce 8 runs the various parts of its core at differing clock speeds , similar to the operation of the previous GeForce 7 Series GPUs. For example, the stream processors of GeForce 8800 GTX operate at a 1.35 GHz clock rate while the rest of the chip is operating at 575 MHz.GeForce 8 performs significantly better texture filtering than its predecessors that used various optimizations and visual tricks to speed up rendering without impairing filtering quality. The GeForce 8 line correctly renders an angle independent anisotropic filtering algorithm along with full trilinear texture filtering. G80, though not its smaller brethren, is equipped with much more texture filtering arithmetic ability than the GeForce 7 series. This allows high quality filtering with a much smaller performance hit than previously.NVIDIA has also introduced new polygon edge anti aliasing methods, including the ability of the GPU's ROPs to perform both Multisample anti aliasing and HDR lighting at the same time, correcting various limitations of previous generations. GeForce 8 can perform MSAA with both FP16 and FP32 texture formats. GeForce 8 supports 128 bit HDR rendering, an increase from prior cards' 64 bit support. The chip's new anti aliasing technology, called coverage sampling AA , uses Z, color, and coverage information to determine final pixel color. This technique of color optimization allows 16X CSAA to look crisp and sharp.  Performance The claimed theoretical single precision processing power for Tesla based cards given in FLOPS may be hard to reach in real world workloads.In G80 G90 GT200, each Streaming Multiprocessor contains 8 Shader Processors and 2 Special Function Units . Each SP can fulfill up to two single precision operations per clock: 1 Multiply and 1 Add, using a single MAD instruction. Each SFU can fulfill up to four operations per clock: four MUL instructions. So one SM as a whole can execute 8 MADs and 8 MULs per clock, or 24 operations per clock, which is 3 times the number of SPs. Therefore, to calculate the theoretical dual issue MAD MUL performance in floating point operations per second FLOPSsp sfu, GFLOPS of a graphics card with SP count n and shader frequency f, GHz , the formula is: FLOPSsp sfu 3 n f.However leveraging dual issue performance like MAD MUL is problematic: Dual issuing the MUL is not available in graphics mode on G80 G90, though it was much improved in GT200. Not all combinations of instructions like MAD MUL can be executed in parallel on the SP and SFU, because the SFU is rather specialized as it can only handle a specific subset of instructions: 32 bit floating point multiplication, transcendental functions, interpolation for parameter blending, reciprocal, reciprocal square root, sine, cosine, etc. The SFU could become busy for many cycles when executing these instructions, in which case it is unavailable for dual issuing MUL instructions.For these reasons, in order to estimate the performance of real world workloads, it may be more helpful to ignore the SFU and to assume only 1 MAD per SP per cycle. In this case the formula to calculate the theoretical performance in floating point operations per second becomes: FLOPSsp 2 n f. The theoretical double precision processing power of a Tesla GPU is 1 8 of the single precision performance on GT200; there is no double precision support on G8x and G9x.

            "text": "Tamo daleko is a Serbian folk song which was composed on the Greek island of Corfu in 1916 to commemorate the Serbian Army's retreat through Albania during World War I. It is played in triple metre and begins solemnly in a minor key before switching to the relative major of the dominant key in the third line of the first verse, symbolizing hope before returning to the tonic minor key from the beginning. The lyrics to the song come in multiple versions, all of which end with the line long live Serbia! The song became very popular amongst Serbian migr s following World War I and was even played on the violin at Serb inventor Nikola Tesla's funeral in January 1943. A symbol of Serbian culture and national identity, it came to be viewed as a form of national anthem in the Serbian diaspora during the Cold War, and some of its lyrics were prohibited alongside several other songs in Titoist Yugoslavia because they evoked the resurgence of Serbian national feeling. The identity of its writer and composer remained a matter of dispute for many decades. In 2008, historian Ranko Jakovljevi discovered that or e Marinkovi , an amateur musician from the village of Korbovo near Kladovo, was the song's original writer and composer, having composed the song in 1916 and secured its authorship rights in Paris in 1922. The song remains popular amongst Serbs in the Balkans and the diaspora.  History   Background  During World War I, the Serbian Army retreated through Albania after the Central Powers invaded the Kingdom of Serbia during the winter of 1915. The Serbian Army was devastated by hunger, disease and attacks by armed bands before regrouping on the Greek island of Corfu, where many more Serbian soldiers died. Fatalities were buried at sea and surviving Serbian soldiers named those waters the Blue Graveyard .  Song  Tamo daleko is a Serbian folk song. Composed in 1916, it commemorates the retreat of the Serbian Army to Corfu and revolves around the theme of loss and longing for a distant homeland. It is played in triple metre and begins solemnly in a minor key before switching to the relative major of the dominant key in the third line of the first verse, symbolizing hope before returning to the tonic minor key from the beginning. The singer describes himself as being from the land where the lemon tree blooms yellow and looks far away in the distance, where the sun shines brighter to the village where he was born. Most versions of the song end with the line long live Serbia! .In April 1917, a Serbian American group named Tambura ko Peva ko Dru tvo made a recording of the song. Towards the end of World War I, the Serbian Army retook Serbia from Austria Hungary and Bulgaria. Tamo daleko became very popular amongst Serbian migr s. The song was even played at the funeral of the Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla in New York City in January 1943. In Titoist Yugoslavia, it was performed by Du an Jak i , Nikola Vu etin Bata and others, but usually without the lines explicitly mentioning Serbia. From around 1985, lyrics mentioning Serbia and the Serbian Army appear again in official releases of the song in Yugoslavia.Historian Andrej Mitrovi writes of the song's nostalgic air and sorrowful melody . He argues that it provides great insight into the collective psychology and overall morale of the Serbian Army during the winter of 1915. He asserts that while the song is nostalgic, the basic idea is one of optimism. Journalist Roger Cohen describes Tamo daleko as the lament of a people uprooted . The author Robert Hudson writes that a sense of primordial identity, linked to family and nation, is embedded in the song, with father and son giving up their lives for the nation . Author Eric Gordy describes it as one of the most recognizable Serbian nationalist songs. During the Cold War, Serbs in the diaspora began viewing it as a form of national anthem. The song was as significant as the March on the Drina in the history of Serbian music. It became a powerful symbol of Serbian culture and national identity. In 1964, it was featured in the Bulgarian film The Peach Thief. In the early 1990s Radio Television of Serbia broadcast a documentary showing Serbian veterans returning to Corfu, with Tamo daleko playing gently in the background. Many variations of the song were sung by Bosnian Serb volunteers during the Bosnian War. The song remains popular amongst Serbs in the Balkans and the diaspora and several modern versions of it have been recorded, most notably by musician Goran Bregovi .  Authorship  The identity of the song's writer and composer remained unknown for many decades. Several individuals claimed to have been its original authors. Some contended that Milan Buzin, the chaplain of the Drina Division, had composed and written the song. Others claimed that Dimitrije Mari , the surgeon of the Third field hospital of the umadija Division, was the composer. Mihailo Zastavnikovi , a teacher from Negotin, was also rumoured to have been the original composer and writer and had even published one version of the song in 1926. In 2008, historian Ranko Jakovljevi discovered that or e Marinkovi , an amateur musician from the village of Korbovo near Kladovo, was the song's original writer and composer. He composed Tamo daleko in Corfu in 1916 and moved to Paris after World War I, where he secured the authorship rights to the song in 1922. He lived in relative obscurity until his death in 1977.  Lyrics There are multiple versions of Tamo daleko in existence. A common version goes as follows:  Yugoslav Partisan version During World War II the Communist led Yugoslav Partisans also sung a version of the song, dedicated to the Yugoslav People's Army and Josip Broz Tito:  Covers Dort in der Ferne by Eugen Cicero  Citations   Notes   Footnotes   References   External links Tamo daleko Opus Djordja Marinkovica",

            "text": "A polyphase system is a means of distributing alternating current electrical power where the power transfer is constant during each electrical cycle. AC phase refers to the phase offset value between AC in multiple conducting wires; phases may also refer to the corresponding terminals and conductors, as in color codes. Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a defined phase between the voltage waves in each conductor; for three phase voltage, the phase angle is 120 or 2 3 radians . Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors which rely on alternating current to rotate. The most common example is the three phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. Compared to a single phase, two wire system, a three phase three wire system transmits three times as much power for the same conductor size and voltage.  Systems with more than three phases are often used for rectifier and power conversion systems, and have been studied for power transmission.  Number of phases In the very early days of commercial electric power, some installations used two phase four wire systems for motors. The chief advantage of these was that the winding configuration was the same as for a single phase capacitor start motor and, by using a four wire system, conceptually the phases were independent and easy to analyse with mathematical tools available at the time. Two phase systems can also be implemented using three wires . However this introduces asymmetry; the voltage drop in the neutral makes the phases not exactly 90 degrees apart. Two phase systems have been replaced with three phase systems. A two phase supply with 90 degrees between phases can be derived from a three phase system using a Scott connected transformer. A polyphase system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so that mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A 3 wire system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as split phase.  Motors  Polyphase power is particularly useful in AC motors, such as the induction motor, where it generates a rotating magnetic field. When a three or more phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two poles per phase motor has rotated through 360 in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run slower. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and developed in a three phase form by Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky in 1889. Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive commutators, high maintenance brushes and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network. Polyphase motors are simple to construct, are self starting and have little vibration compared with single phase motors.  Higher phase order Once polyphase power is available, it may be converted to any desired number of phases with a suitable arrangement of transformers. Thus, the need for more than three phases is unusual, but higher phase numbers than three have been used. Between 1992 and 1995, New York State Electric Gas operated a 1.5 mile converted from a double circuit 3 phase 115KV transmission line to a 93KV 6 phase transmission line. The primary result was that it is economically favorable to operate an existing double circuit 115KV 3 phase line as a 6 phase line for distances greater than 23 28 miles.Multi phase power generation designs with 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 phases in conjunction with multi phase induction generators driven by wind turbines have been proposed. An induction generator produces electrical power when its rotor is turned faster than the synchronous speed. A multi phase induction generator has more poles, and therefore a lower synchronous speed. Since the rotation speed of a wind turbine may be too slow for a substantial portion of its operation to generate single phase or even three phase AC power, higher phase orders allow the system to capture a larger portion of the rotational energy as electric power.High phase order power transmission has been frequently proposed as a way to increase transmission capacity within a limited width right of way. The required conductor spacing is determined by the phase to phase voltages, and six phase power has the same voltage between adjacent phases as between phase and neutral. However voltages between non adjacent phase conductors increases as the difference increases between phase angles of the conductors. Conductors can be arranged so that non adjacent phases are spaced farther apart than adjacent phases.  This lets an existing double circuit transmission line carry more power with minimal change to the existing cable plant. This is particularly economical when the alternative is upgrading an existing extra high voltage transmission line to ultra high voltage standards. By contrast, three phase power has phase to phase voltages equal to 3 1.732 times the phase to neutral voltage.

            "text": "Krsto Papi was a Croatian screenwriter and film director whose career spanned over five decades. He is generally considered among the best directors of former Yugoslavia and the only director from Croatia that can be counted among the Yugoslav Black Wave.  Biography Papi was born in Vu ji Do, near Nik i in today's Montenegro. His early feature films and documentaries were part of Croatian and Yugoslav New Cinema, and often regarded as Croatian echo of the Black Wave artistic movement that mostly took place within Serbia. Additionally, Papi himself was connected to the Croatian Spring political movement during the early 1970s. He was the member of the Zagreb filmophile circle influenced by the French New Wave, so called Hitchcockians , along with film makers and critics Ante Peterli , Zoran Tadi , Branko Ivanda, Petar Krelja and centered on film critics Vladimir Vukovi and Hrvoje Lisinski. Papi 's two best known early feature films, Lisice and Predstava Hamleta u Mrdu i Donjoj, were often attacked from the government sources. Lisice did not get permission to represent Yugoslavia in the Cannes Film Festival, so it entered Quinzaine program in 1970. Izbavitelj was heavily criticised by Stipe uvar, who alluded that film's allegory about fascism actually also refers to the communism.Papi 's subsequent feature films were more classical in its narration, but again politically controversial in the last decade of Yugoslavia. Particularly My Uncle's Legacy, critical picture of Yugoslavia's political situation under Titoism during Informbiro period, which was nominated for Golden Globe in 1989, has been surrounded by controversy and political attacks from traditional Party circles and especially Partisan Veterans' organisations, so the production was delayed for couple of years, but achieved due to support of intellectuals, newspapers and Party fractions in the time of disolvement and fight among Party fractions in last years of the Yugoslav federation. Papi was awarded with Croatia's highest Vladimir Nazor Award for live achievement in cinema in 2006, and with Grand Prix Special des Am riques in 2004.He died in Zagreb on 7 February 2013 after a battle with stomach cancer, aged 79.

            "text": "El Paso Electric is a Texas based public utility company, engaging in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in west Texas and southern New Mexico. Its energy sources consist of nuclear fuel, natural gas, purchased power, solar and wind turbines. The company owns six electrical generating facilities with a net dependable generating capability of approximately 2,010 megawatts. It serves approximately 437,000 residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, and wholesale customers.The company distributes electricity to retail customers principally in El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico; and resells electricity to electric utilities and power marketers. Unlike most other Texas utilities, El Paso Electric operates as a monopoly.In 2020, El Paso Electric was sold to the Infrastructure Investments Fund , a fund associated with investment bank, J.P. Morgan. Previously, the company was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange as EE. El Paso Electric Company was founded in 1901 and is headquartered at the Stanton Tower in Downtown El Paso.  History  El Paso Electric first began serving its customers on August 30, 1901. It was then known as the El Paso Electric Railway Company. Initially its primary business consisted of providing transportation via mule drawn streetcars, which were replaced in 1902 with electric streetcars. The company is reported to have provided electricity to Nikola Tesla's property in Colorado.By 1925, the company's core business had evolved to producing and distributing electricity. That year, the company changed its name to the El Paso Electric Company. It was also granted authorization to transact business in New Mexico.Today, El Paso Electric is a regional electric utility providing generation, transmission, and distribution service to approximately 400,000 retail and wholesale customers in a 10,000 square mile area of the Rio Grande valley in west Texas and southern New Mexico. Its service territory extends from Hatch, New Mexico to Van Horn, Texas. As of 2013, El Paso Electric had 32 electric car charging stations in its service area. The service stations recharge Nissan Leafs, Chevrolet Volts, and other electric cars. The company is also working to expand adoption of electric vehicles through its Plug in Electric Vehicle and Charging Infrastructure Plan for the Rio Grande Valley region.In 2019, the company reported annual operating revenues of 862 million and a net income of 123 million.  2020 Sale to JPMorgan Chase On July 29, 2020, El Paso Electric was sold to JP Morgan affiliated equity firm Infrastructure Investments Fund with 99.61 of shareholders who voted approving the deal.The sale was valued at 4.3 billion and included IIF assuming EPE's existing 1.5 billion in debt and purchasing the companies stock at 68.25 per share . Stipulations in the agreement included a commitment by IIF to keep the company's headquarters in El Paso and maintaining the companies staff for at least five years. All thirteen El Paso Electric Board Members received payouts and stock share awards ranging from 800,000 to over 8.8 million.Because El Paso Electric is the sole provider of electricity for the region, prior to its acquisition, increases in electricity rates would have to be approved by the city council and state regulators. Some local leaders voiced opposition to the acquisition, citing concerns of unregulated rate increases to consumers. As part of the agreement, El Paso Electric touted a one time 21 million credit for El Paso customers and a 8.7 million credit for New Mexico customers, resulting in an average monthly bill decrease of 0.88 to 1.37.As part of the transaction, EPE and IIF committed to investing 100 million in a Economic Sustainability Fund to promote economic development in the region. 80 million is committed to be distributed in the El Paso region, over 15 years, and 20 million in the New Mexico region, over 20 years.  Transmission system  El Paso Electric transmission system voltages are 115,000 volts and 345,000 volts. There are also two 115 kV interconnections with Mexico to the south.  Generating plants El Paso Electric ownership in power plants include a 15.8 percent interest in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Tonopah, Arizona, the Rio Grande Power Station in Sunland Park, New Mexico, the Newman Power Station, the Copper Power Station and the Montana Power Station in El Paso and the Hueco Mountain Wind Ranch in Hudspeth County, Texas. On February 20, 2014, El Paso Electric signed an agreement with Colorado based Juwi Solar, Inc., to build a 10 megawatt solar energy facility in Northeast El Paso next to EPE's Newman Generation Station. JSI will be responsible for developing, designing, building, and operating the Newman Solar project. The design phase will begin in early summer of this year, shortly followed by construction and final completion of the project tentatively scheduled for the end of 2014. The construction of the new solar facility will help power over 3,800 homes throughout the year. The facility will be built on approximately 100 acres. EPE will sublease the land in partnership with the El Paso Water Utilities and currently leased to EPE for the Newman Generation Station. EPE currently has 47 MWs of solar power in its generation mix and recently secured an additional 50 MWs of solar power that will be online by the summer of this year. In total, 5 percent of EPE's dedicated generation, which includes long term purchase power agreements, will come from solar energy.  Lawsuits In January, 2003, a complaint was filed against EI Paso Electric alleging that the company issued materially false and misleading information by misrepresenting and or omitting adverse facts concerning illegal arrangements with Enron Corporation and by artificially inflating revenues. A settlement of 10,000,000 was reached in 2005.  References   External links El Paso Electric Company",

            "text": "Gymnasium Karlovac , sometimes historically referred to as Higher Real Gymnasium, is a secondary school located in the city of Karlovac in Croatia.  Description Housed in a dedicated building constructed in 1863, the school considers itself to have been founded as early as 1766. At that time, Karlovac was part of the Croatian Military Frontier under the rule of the Austrian Empire. Starting in 1766 and under the direction of Maria Theresa of Austria, piarists were sent to Karlovac to teach subjects to two grade levels, the main subject being the Latin language. In early 2010 the gymnasium was accepted as the 37th member of the German global school network in Croatia. This designation allows students to attend German universities without having to complete the usual prerequisite German language entrance examination.  Notable alumni The inventor, electrical and mechanical engineer Nikola Tesla, who attended the school from 1870 until 1873 , attributes his interest in electricity to what he learned at Karlovac. In his 1919 autobiography My Inventions he wrote that demonstrations by his professor of physics sparked his interest in this mysterious phenomena and made him want to know more of this wonderful force . Stricken with malaria shortly after his arrival in the mosquito infested swampy lowlands of Karlovac, he was bedridden at times and often took his school books home to read and memorize when he was unable to attend class. He graduated with honours from the four year course in only three years.Other notable alumni includes artist Pavle Stanimirovic son of Vojislav Stanimirovic also has attended Karlovac Gimnazium after Swiss 1997 boarding school. Other notable alumni include actress Zrinka Cvite i , poet and writer Ivan Goran Kova i , politician and founder of the Croatian Peasant Party Stjepan Radi and explorers and brothers Mirko and Stjepan Seljan.

            "text": "Lee de Forest was an American inventor and a fundamentally important early pioneer in electronics. He invented the first electronic device for controlling current flow; the three element Audion triode vacuum tube in 1906. This started the Electronic Age, and enabled the development of the electronic amplifier and oscillator. These made radio broadcasting and long distance telephone lines possible, and led to the development of talking motion pictures, among countless other applications. He had over 300 patents worldwide, but also a tumultuous career he boasted that he made, then lost, four fortunes. He was also involved in several major patent lawsuits, spent a substantial part of his income on legal bills, and was even tried for mail fraud. Despite this, he was recognised for his pioneering work with the 1922 IEEE Medal of Honor, the 1923 Franklin Institute Elliott Cresson Medal and the 1946 American Institute of Electrical Engineers Edison Medal.  Early life Lee de Forest was born in 1873 in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the son of Anna Margaret and Henry Swift DeForest. He was a direct descendant of Jess de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th century due to religious persecution. De Forest's father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association's Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color , and which educated primarily African Americans. Many of the local white citizens resented the school and its mission, and Lee spent most of his youth in Talladega isolated from the white community, with several close friends among the black children of the town. De Forest prepared for college by attending Mount Hermon Boys' School in Mount Hermon, Massachusetts for two years, beginning in 1891. In 1893, he enrolled in a three year course of studies at Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School in New Haven, Connecticut, on a 300 per year scholarship that had been established for relatives of David de Forest. Convinced that he was destined to become a famous and rich inventor, and perpetually short of funds, he sought to interest companies with a series of devices and puzzles he created, and expectantly submitted essays in prize competitions, all with little success. After completing his undergraduate studies, in September 1896 de Forest began three years of postgraduate work. However, his electrical experiments had a tendency to blow fuses, causing building wide blackouts. Even after being warned to be more careful, he managed to douse the lights during an important lecture by Professor Charles S. Hastings, who responded by having de Forest expelled from Sheffield. With the outbreak of the Spanish American War in 1898, de Forest enrolled in the Connecticut Volunteer Militia Battery as a bugler, but the war ended and he was mustered out without ever leaving the state. He then completed his studies at Yale's Sloane Physics Laboratory, earning a Doctorate in 1899 with a dissertation on the Reflection of Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires , supervised by theoretical physicist Willard Gibbs.  Early radio work  Reflecting his pioneering work, de Forest has sometimes been credited as the Father of Radio , an honorific which he adopted as the title of his 1950 autobiography. In the late 1800s he became convinced there was a great future in radiotelegraphic communication , but Italian Guglielmo Marconi, who received his first patent in 1896, was already making impressive progress in both Europe and the United States. One drawback of Marconi's approach was his use of a coherer as a receiver, which, while providing for permanent records, was also slow , insensitive, and not very reliable. De Forest was determined to devise a better system, including a self restoring detector that could receive transmissions by ear, thus making it capable of receiving weaker signals and also allowing faster Morse code sending speeds. After making unsuccessful inquiries about employment with Nikola Tesla and Marconi, de Forest struck out on his own. His first job after leaving Yale was with the Western Electric Company's telephone lab in Chicago, Illinois. While there he developed his first receiver, which was based on findings by two German scientists, Drs. A. Neugschwender and Emil Aschkinass. Their original design consisted of a mirror in which a narrow, moistened slit had been cut through the silvered back. Attaching a battery and telephone receiver, they could hear sound changes in response to radio signal impulses. De Forest, along with Ed Smythe, a co worker who provided financial and technical help, developed variations they called responders . A series of short term positions followed, including three unproductive months with Professor Warren S. Johnson's American Wireless Telegraph Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and work as an assistant editor of the Western Electrician in Chicago. With radio research his main priority, de Forest next took a night teaching position at the Lewis Institute, which freed him to conduct experiments at the Armour Institute. By 1900, using a spark coil transmitter and his responder receiver, de Forest expanded his transmitting range to about seven kilometers . Professor Clarence Freeman of the Armour Institute became interested in de Forest's work and developed a new type of spark transmitter. De Forest soon felt that Smythe and Freeman were holding him back, so in the fall of 1901 he made the bold decision to go to New York to compete directly with Marconi in transmitting race results for the International Yacht races. Marconi had already made arrangements to provide reports for the Associated Press, which he had successfully done for the 1899 contest. De Forest contracted to do the same for the smaller Publishers' Press Association. The race effort turned out to be an almost total failure. The Freeman transmitter broke down in a fit of rage, de Forest threw it overboard and had to be replaced by an ordinary spark coil. Even worse, the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, which claimed its ownership of Amos Dolbear's 1886 patent for wireless communication meant it held a monopoly for all wireless communication in the United States, had also set up a powerful transmitter. None of these companies had effective tuning for their transmitters, so only one could transmit at a time without causing mutual interference. Although an attempt was made to have the three systems avoid conflicts by rotating operations over five minute intervals, the agreement broke down, resulting in chaos as the simultaneous transmissions clashed with each other. De Forest ruefully noted that under these conditions the only successful wireless communication was done by visual semaphore wig wag flags. operated a high powered transmitter that was used primarily to drown out the other two.  American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company  Despite this setback, de Forest remained in the New York City area, in order to raise interest in his ideas and capital to replace the small working companies that had been formed to promote his work thus far. In January 1902 he met a promoter, Abraham White, who would become de Forest's main sponsor for the next five years. White envisioned bold and expansive plans that enticed the inventor however, he was also dishonest and much of the new enterprise would be built on wild exaggeration and stock fraud. To back de Forest's efforts, White incorporated the American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company, with himself as the company's president, and de Forest the Scientific Director. The company claimed as its goal the development of world wide wireless . The original responder receiver proved to be too crude to be commercialized, and de Forest struggled to develop a non infringing device for receiving radio signals. In 1903, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated an electrolytic detector, and de Forest developed a variation, which he called the spade detector , claiming it did not infringe on Fessenden's patents. Fessenden, and the U.S. courts, did not agree, and court injunctions enjoined American De Forest from using the device. Meanwhile, White set in motion a series of highly visible promotions for American DeForest: Wireless Auto No.1 was positioned on Wall Street to send stock quotes using an unmuffled spark transmitter to loudly draw the attention of potential investors, in early 1904 two stations were established at Wei hai Wei on the Chinese mainland and aboard the Chinese steamer SS Haimun, which allowed war correspondent Captain Lionel James of The Times of London to report on the brewing Russo Japanese War, and later that year a tower, with DEFOREST arrayed in lights, was erected on the grounds of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri, where the company won a gold medal for its radiotelegraph demonstrations. .The company's most important early contract was the construction, in 1905 1906, of five high powered radiotelegraph stations for the U.S. Navy, located in Panama, Pensacola and Key West, Florida, Guantanamo, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. It also installed shore stations along the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes, and equipped shipboard stations. But the main focus was selling stock at ever more inflated prices, spurred by the construction of promotional inland stations. Most of these inland stations had no practical use and were abandoned once the local stock sales slowed. De Forest eventually came into conflict with his company's management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest's inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. . On November 28, 1906, in exchange for 1000 and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest turned in his stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit propped up by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.  Radio Telephone Company De Forest moved quickly to re establish himself as an independent inventor, working in his own laboratory in the Parker Building in New York City. The Radio Telephone Company was incorporated in order to promote his inventions, with James Dunlop Smith, a former American DeForest salesman, as president, and de Forest the vice president .  Arc radiotelephone development  At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had presented a paper on an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady continuous wave signals that could be used for amplitude modulated audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to have come up with a variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen's work. Using his sparkless arc transmitter, de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill's telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city. On July 18, 1907, de Forest made the first ship to shore transmissions by radiotelephone race reports for the Annual Inter Lakes Yachting Association Regatta held on Lake Erie which were sent from the steam yacht Thelma to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox's Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island. De Forest also interested the U.S. Navy in his radiotelephone, which placed a rush order to have 26 arc sets installed for its Great White Fleet around the world voyage that began in late 1907. However, at the conclusion of the circumnavigation the sets were declared to be too unreliable to meet the Navy's needs and removed.The company set up a network of radiotelephone stations along the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, for coastal ship navigation. However, the installations proved unprofitable, and by 1911 the parent company and its subsidiaries were on the brink of bankruptcy.  Initial broadcasting experiments  De Forest also used the arc transmitter to conduct some of the earliest experimental entertainment radio broadcasts. Eugenia Farrar sang I Love You Truly in an unpublicized test from his laboratory in 1907, and in 1908, on de Forest's Paris honeymoon, musical selections were broadcast from the Eiffel Tower as a part of demonstrations of the arc transmitter. In early 1909, in what may have been the first public speech by radio, de Forest's mother in law, Harriot Stanton Blatch, made a broadcast supporting women's suffrage.More ambitious demonstrations followed. A series of tests in conjunction with the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City were conducted to determine whether it was practical to broadcast opera performances live from the stage. Tosca was performed on January 12, 1910, and the next day's test included Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. On February 24, the Manhattan Opera Company's Mme. Mariette Mazarin sang La Habanera from Carmen over a transmitter located in de Forest's lab. But these tests showed that the idea was not yet technically feasible, and de Forest would not make any additional entertainment broadcasts until late 1916, when more capable vacuum tube equipment became available.  Grid Audion detector  De Forest's most famous invention was the grid Audion , which was the first successful three element vacuum tube, and the first device which could amplify electrical signals. He traced its inspiration to 1900, when, experimenting with a spark gap transmitter, he briefly thought that the flickering of a nearby gas flame might be in response to electromagnetic pulses. With further tests he soon determined that the cause of the flame fluctuations was due to air pressure changes produced by the loud sound of the spark. Still, he was intrigued by the idea that, properly configured, it might be possible to use a flame or something similar to detect radio signals. After determining that an open flame was too susceptible to ambient air currents, de Forest investigated whether ionized gases, heated and enclosed in a partially evacuated glass tube, could be used instead. In 1905 to 1906 he developed various configurations of glass tube devices, which he gave the general name of Audions . The first Audions had only two electrodes, and on October 25, 1906, de Forest filed a patent for diode vacuum tube detector, that was granted U.S. patent number 841387 on January 15, 1907. Subsequently, a third control electrode was added, originally as a surrounding metal cylinder or a wire coiled around the outside of the glass tube. None of these initial designs worked particularly well. De Forest gave a presentation of his work to date to the October 26, 1906 New York meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which was reprinted in two parts in late 1907 in the Scientific American Supplement. He was insistent that a small amount of residual gas was necessary for the tubes to operate properly. However, he also admitted that I have arrived as yet at no completely satisfactory theory as to the exact means by which the high frequency oscillations affect so markedly the behavior of an ionized gas. In late 1906, de Forest made a breakthrough when he reconfigured the control electrode, moving it from outside the tube envelope to a position inside the tube between the filament and the plate. He called the intermediate electrode a grid, reportedly due to its similarity to the gridiron lines on American football playing fields. Experiments conducted with his assistant, John V. L. Hogan, convinced him that he had discovered an important new radio detector. He quickly prepared a patent application which was filed on January 29, 1907, and received U.S. Patent 879,532 on February 18, 1908. Because the grid control Audion was the only configuration to become commercially valuable, the earlier versions were forgotten, and the term Audion later became synonymous with just the grid type. It later also became known as the triode. The grid Audion was the first device to amplify, albeit only slightly, the strength of received radio signals. However, to many observers it appeared that de Forest had done nothing more than add the grid electrode to an existing detector configuration, the Fleming valve, which also consisted of a filament and plate enclosed in an evacuated glass tube. De Forest passionately denied the similarly of the two devices, claiming his invention was a relay that amplified currents, while the Fleming valve was merely a rectifier that converted alternating current to direct current. The U.S. courts were not convinced, and ruled that the grid Audion did in fact infringe on the Fleming valve patent, now held by Marconi. In contrast, Marconi admitted that the addition of the third electrode was a patentable improvement, and the two sides agreed to license each other so that both could manufacture three electrode tubes in the United States. .Because of its limited uses and the great variability in the quality of individual units, the grid Audion would be rarely used during the first half decade after its invention. In 1908, John V. L. Hogan reported that The Audion is capable of being developed into a really efficient detector, but in its present forms is quite unreliable and entirely too complex to be properly handled by the usual wireless operator.  Employment at Federal Telegraph  In May 1910, the Radio Telephone Company and its subsidiaries were reorganized as the North American Wireless Corporation, but financial difficulties meant that the company's activities had nearly come to a halt. De Forest moved to San Francisco, California, and in early 1911 took a research job at the Federal Telegraph Company, which produced long range radiotelegraph systems using high powered Poulsen arcs.  Audio frequency amplification  One of de Forest's areas of research at Federal Telegraph was improving the reception of signals, and he came up with the idea of strengthening the audio frequency output from a grid Audion by feeding it into a second tube for additional amplification. He called this a cascade amplifier , which eventually consisted of chaining together up to three Audions. At this time the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify telephone signals to provide better long distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest's device had potential as a telephone line repeater. In mid 1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT T to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest's gassy version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT T's Western Electric subsidiary determined that improving the tube's design would allow it to be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to operate at telephone line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. . After a delay of ten months, in July 1913 AT T, through a third party who disguised his link to the telephone company, purchased the wire rights to seven Audion patents for 50,000. De Forest had hoped for a higher payment, but was again in bad financial shape and was unable to bargain for more. In 1915, AT T used the innovation to conduct the first transcontinental telephone calls, in conjunction with the Panama Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco.  Reorganized Radio Telephone Company Radio Telephone Company officials had engaged in some of the same stock selling excesses that had taken place at American DeForest, and as part of the U.S. government's crackdown on stock fraud, in March 1912 de Forest, plus four other company officials, were arrested and charged with use of the mails to defraud . Their trials took place in late 1913, and while three of the defendants were found guilty, de Forest was acquitted. With the legal problems behind him, de Forest reorganized his company as the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and established a laboratory at 1391 Sedgewick Avenue in the Highbridge section of the Bronx in New York City. The company's limited finances were boosted by the sale, in October 1914, of the commercial Audion patent rights for radio signalling to AT T for 90,000, with de Forest retaining the rights for sales for amateur and experimental use . In October 1915 AT T conducted test radio transmissions from the Navy's station in Arlington, Virginia that were heard as far away as Paris and Hawaii. The Radio Telephone Company began selling Oscillion power tubes to amateurs, suitable for radio transmissions. The company wanted to keep a tight hold on the tube business, and originally maintained a policy that retailers had to require their customers to return a worn out tube before they could get a replacement. This style of business encouraged others to make and sell unlicensed vacuum tubes which did not impose a return policy. One of the boldest was Audio Tron Sales Company founded in 1915 by Elmer T. Cunningham of San Francisco, whose Audio Tron tubes cost less but were of equal or higher quality. The de Forest company sued Audio Tron Sales, eventually settling out of court.In April 1917, the company's remaining commercial radio patent rights were sold to AT T's Western Electric subsidiary for 250,000. During World War I, the Radio Telephone Company prospered from sales of radio equipment to the military. However, it also became known for the poor quality of its vacuum tubes, especially compared to those produced by major industrial manufacturers such as General Electric and Western Electric.  Regeneration controversy  Beginning in 1912, there was increased investigation of vacuum tube capabilities, simultaneously by numerous inventors in multiple countries, who identified additional important uses for the device. These overlapping discoveries led to complicated legal disputes over priority, perhaps the most bitter being one in the United States between de Forest and Edwin Howard Armstrong over the discovery of regeneration .Beginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared papers and gave demonstrations that comprehensively documented how to employ three element vacuum tubes in circuits that amplified signals to stronger levels than previously thought possible, and that could also generate high power oscillations usable for radio transmission. In late 1913 Armstrong applied for patents covering the regenerative circuit, and on October 6, 1914 U.S. Patent 1,113,149 was issued for his discovery.U.S. patent law included a provision for challenging grants if another inventor could prove prior discovery. With an eye to increasing the value of the patent portfolio that would be sold to Western Electric in 1917, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of patent applications that largely copied Armstrong's claims, in the hopes of having the priority of the competing applications upheld by an interference hearing at the patent office. Based on a notebook entry recorded at the time, de Forest asserted that, while working on the cascade amplifier, he had stumbled on August 6, 1912 across the feedback principle, which was then used in the spring of 1913 to operate a low powered transmitter for heterodyne reception of Federal Telegraph arc transmissions. However, there was also strong evidence that de Forest was unaware of the full significance of this discovery, as shown by his lack of follow up and continuing misunderstanding of the physics involved. In particular, it appeared that he was unaware of the potential for further development until he became familiar with Armstrong's research. De Forest was not alone in the interference determination the patent office identified four competing claimants for its hearings, consisting of Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric's Langmuir, and a German, Alexander Meissner, whose application would be seized by the Office of Alien Property Custodian during World War I.The subsequent legal proceedings become divided between two groups of court cases. The first court action began in January 1920 when Armstrong, with Westinghouse, which purchased his patent, sued the De Forest Company in district court for infringement of patent 1,113,149. On May 17, 1921 the court ruled that the lack of awareness and understanding on de Forest's part, in addition to the fact that he had made no immediate advances beyond his initial observation, made implausible his attempt to prevail as inventor. However, a second series of court cases, which were the result of the patent office interference proceeding, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, and de Forest appealed its decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court concluded that the evidence, beginning with the 1912 notebook entry, was sufficient to establish de Forest's priority. Now on the defensive, Armstrong's side tried to overturn the decision, but these efforts, which twice went before the U.S. Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, were unsuccessful.This judicial ruling meant that Lee de Forest was now legally recognized in the United States as the inventor of regeneration. However, much of the engineering community continued to consider Armstrong to be the actual developer, with de Forest viewed as someone who skillfully used the patent system to get credit for an invention to which he had barely contributed. Following the 1934 Supreme Court decision, Armstrong attempted to return his Institute of Radio Engineers Medal of Honor, which had been awarded to him in 1917 in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non oscillating audion , but the organization's board refused to let him, stating that it strongly affirms the original award . The practical effect of de Forest's victory was that his company was free to sell products that used regeneration, for during the controversy, which became more a personal feud than a business dispute, Armstrong tried to block the company from even being licensed to sell equipment under his patent. De Forest regularly responded to articles which he thought exaggerated Armstrong's contributions with animosity that continued even after Armstrong's 1954 suicide. Following the publication of Carl Dreher's E. H. Armstrong, the Hero as Inventor in the August 1956 Harper's magazine, de Forest wrote the author, describing Armstrong as exceedingly arrogant, brow beating, even brutal... , and defending the Supreme Court decision in his favor.  Renewed broadcasting activities  In the summer of 1915, the company received an Experimental license for station 2XG, located at its Highbridge laboratory. In late 1916, de Forest renewed the entertainment broadcasts he had suspended in 1910, now using the superior capabilities of vacuum tube equipment. 2XG's debut program aired on October 26, 1916, as part of an arrangement with the Columbia Graphophone Company to promote its recordings, which included announcing the title and 'Columbia Gramophone sic Company' with each playing . Beginning November 1, the Highbridge Station offered a nightly schedule featuring the Columbia recordings. These broadcasts were also used to advertise the products of the DeForest Radio Co., mostly the radio parts, with all the zeal of our catalogue and price list , until comments by Western Electric engineers caused de Forest enough embarrassment to make him decide to eliminate the direct advertising. The station also made the first audio broadcast of election reports in earlier elections, stations that broadcast results had used Morse code providing news of the November 1916 Wilson Hughes presidential election. The New York American installed a private wire and bulletins were sent out every hour. About 2,000 listeners heard The Star Spangled Banner and other anthems, songs, and hymns. With the entry of the United States into World War I on April 6, 1917, all civilian radio stations were ordered to shut down, so 2XG was silenced for the duration of the war. The ban on civilian stations was lifted on October 1, 1919, and 2XG soon renewed operation, with the Brunswick Balke Collender company now supplying the phonograph records. In early 1920, de Forest moved the station's transmitter from the Bronx to Manhattan, but did not have permission to do so, so district Radio Inspector Arthur Batcheller ordered the station off the air. De Forest's response was to return to San Francisco in March, taking 2XG's transmitter with him. A new station, 6XC, was established as The California Theater station , which de Forest later stated was the first radio telephone station devoted solely to broadcasting to the public.Later that year a de Forest associate, Clarence C.S. Thompson, established Radio News Music, Inc., in order to lease de Forest radio transmitters to newspapers interested in setting up their own broadcasting stations. In August 1920, The Detroit News began operation of The Detroit News Radiophone , initially with the callsign 8MK, which later became broadcasting station WWJ.  Phonofilm sound on film process  In 1921, de Forest ended most of his radio research in order to concentrate on developing an optical sound on film process called Phonofilm. In 1919 he filed the first patent for the new system, which improved upon earlier work by Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt and the German partnership Tri Ergon. Phonofilm recorded the electrical waveforms produced by a microphone photographically onto film, using parallel lines of variable shades of gray, an approach known as variable density , in contrast to variable area systems used by processes such as RCA Photophone. When the movie film was projected, the recorded information was converted back into sound, in synchronization with the picture. From October 1921 to September 1922, de Forest lived in Berlin, Germany, meeting the Tri Ergon developers , Hans Vogt , and Joseph Massolle and investigating other European sound film systems. In April 1922 he announced that he would soon have a workable sound on film system. On March 12, 1923 he demonstrated Phonofilm to the press; this was followed on April 12, 1923 by a private demonstration to electrical engineers at the Engineering Society Building's Auditorium at 33 West 39th Street in New York City. In November 1922, de Forest established the De Forest Phonofilm Company, located at 314 East 48th Street in New York City. But none of the Hollywood movie studios expressed interest in his invention, and because at this time these studios controlled all the major theater chains, this meant de Forest was limited to showing his experimental films in independent theaters . After recording stage performances , speeches, and musical acts, on April 15, 1923 de Forest premiered 18 Phonofilm short films at the independent Rivoli Theater in New York City. Starting in May 1924, Max and Dave Fleischer used the Phonofilm process for their Song Car Tune series of cartoons featuring the Follow the Bouncing Ball gimmick. However, de Forest's choice of primarily filming short vaudeville acts, instead of full length features, limited the appeal of Phonofilm to Hollywood studios. De Forest also worked with Freeman Harrison Owens and Theodore Case, using their work to perfect the Phonofilm system. However, de Forest had a falling out with both men. Due to de Forest's continuing misuse of Theodore Case's inventions and failure to publicly acknowledge Case's contributions, the Case Research Laboratory proceeded to build its own camera. That camera was used by Case and his colleague Earl Sponable to record Calvin Coolidge on August 11, 1924, which was one of the films shown by de Forest and claimed by him to be the product of his inventions. Believing that de Forest was more concerned with his own fame and recognition than he was with actually creating a workable system of sound film, and because of his continuing attempts to downplay the contributions of the Case Research Laboratory in the creation of Phonofilm, Case severed his ties with de Forest in the fall of 1925. Case successfully negotiated an agreement to use his patents with studio head William Fox, owner of Fox Film Corporation, who marketed the innovation as Fox Movietone. Warner Brothers introduced a competing method for sound film, the Vitaphone sound on disc process developed by Western Electric, with the August 6, 1926 release of the John Barrymore film Don Juan.In 1927 and 1928, Hollywood expanded its use of sound on film systems, including Fox Movietone and RCA Photophone. Meanwhile, theater chain owner Isadore Schlesinger purchased the UK rights to Phonofilm and released short films of British music hall performers from September 1926 to May 1929. Almost 200 Phonofilm shorts were made, and many are preserved in the collections of the Library of Congress and the British Film Institute.  Later years and death In April 1923, the De Forest Radio Telephone Telegraph Company, which manufactured de Forest's Audions for commercial use, was sold to a group headed by Edward Jewett of Jewett Paige Motors, which expanded the company's factory to cope with rising demand for radios. The sale also bought the services of de Forest, who was focusing his attention on newer innovations. De Forest's finances were badly hurt by the stock market crash of 1929, and research in mechanical television proved unprofitable. In 1934, he established a small shop to produce diathermy machines, and, in a 1942 interview, still hoped to make at least one more great invention .De Forest was a vocal critic of many of the developments in the entertainment side of the radio industry. In 1940 he sent an open letter to the National Association of Broadcasters in which he demanded: What have you done with my child, the radio broadcast? You have debased this child, dressed him in rags of ragtime, tatters of jive and boogie woogie. That same year, de Forest and early TV engineer Ulises Armand Sanabria presented the concept of a primitive unmanned combat air vehicle using a television camera and a jam resistant radio control in a Popular Mechanics issue. In 1950 his autobiography, Father of Radio, was published, although it sold poorly. De Forest was the guest celebrity on the May 22, 1957, episode of the television show This Is Your Life, where he was introduced as the father of radio and the grandfather of television . He suffered a severe heart attack in 1958, after which he remained mostly bedridden. He died in Hollywood on June 30, 1961, aged 87, and was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. De Forest died relatively poor, with just 1,250 in his bank account.  Legacy  The grid Audion, which de Forest called my greatest invention , and the vacuum tubes developed from it, dominated the field of electronics for forty years, making possible long distance telephone service, radio broadcasting, television, and many other applications. It could also be used as an electronic switching element, and was later used in early digital electronics, including the first electronic computers, although the 1948 invention of the transistor would lead to microchips that eventually supplanted vacuum tube technology. For this reason de Forest has been called one of the founders of the electronic age .According to Donald Beaver, his intense desire to overcome the deficiencies of his childhood account for his independence, self reliance, and inventiveness. He displayed a strong desire to achieve, to conquer hardship, and to devote himself to a career of invention. He possessed the qualities of the traditional tinkerer inventor: visionary faith, self confidence, perseverance, the capacity for sustained hard work. De Forest's archives were donated by his widow to the Perham Electronic Foundation, which in 1973 opened the Foothills Electronics Museum at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. In 1991 the college closed the museum, breaking its contract. The foundation won a lawsuit and was awarded 775,000. The holdings were placed in storage for twelve years, before being acquired in 2003 by History San Jos and put on display as The Perham Collection of Early Electronics.  Awards and recognition Charter member, in 1912, of the Institute of Radio Engineers . Received the 1922 IRE Medal of Honor, in recognition for his invention of the three electrode amplifier and his other contributions to radio . Awarded the 1923 Franklin Institute Elliott Cresson Medal for inventions embodied in the Audion . Received the 1946 American Institute of Electrical Engineers Edison Medal, For the profound technical and social consequences of the grid controlled vacuum tube which he had introduced . Honorary Academy Award Oscar presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1960, in recognition of his pioneering inventions which brought sound to the motion picture . Honored February 8, 1960 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. DeVry University was originally named the De Forest Training School by its founder Dr. Herman A. De Vry, who was a friend and colleague of de Forest.  Personal life   Marriages  De Forest was married four times, with the first three marriages ending in divorce: Lucille Sheardown in February 1906. Divorced before the end of the year. Nora Stanton Blatch Barney on February 14, 1908. They had a daughter, Harriet, but were separated by 1909 and divorced in 1912. Mary Mayo in December 1912. According to census records, in 1920 they were living with their infant daughter, Deena ; divorced October 5, 1930 . Mayo died December 30, 1957 in a fire in Los Angeles. Marie Mosquini on October 10, 1930; Mosquini was a silent film actress, and they remained married until his death in 1961.  Politics  De Forest was a conservative Republican and fervent anti communist and anti fascist. In 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, he voted for Franklin Roosevelt, but later came to resent him, calling Roosevelt America's first Fascist president . In 1949, he sent letters to all members of Congress urging them to vote against socialized medicine, federally subsidized housing, and an excess profits tax . In 1952, he wrote to the newly elected Vice President Richard Nixon, urging him to prosecute with renewed vigor your valiant fight to put out Communism from every branch of our government . In December 1953, he cancelled his subscription to The Nation, accusing it of being lousy with Treason, crawling with Communism.  Religious views  Although raised in a strongly religious Protestant household, de Forest later became an agnostic. In his autobiography, he wrote that in the summer of 1894 there was an important shift in his beliefs: Through that Freshman vacation at Yale I became more of a philosopher than I have ever since. And thus, one by one, were my childhood's firm religious beliefs altered or reluctantly discarded.  Quotes De Forest was given to expansive predictions, many of which were not borne out, but he also made many correct predictions, including microwave communication and cooking. I discovered an Invisible Empire of the Air, intangible, yet solid as granite. I foresee great refinements in the field of short pulse microwave signaling, whereby several simultaneous programs may occupy the same channel, in sequence, with incredibly swift electronic communication. ... Short waves will be generally used in the kitchen for roasting and baking, almost instantaneously. 1952 So I repeat that while theoretically and technically television may be feasible, yet commercially and financially, I consider it an impossibility; a development of which we need not waste little time in dreaming. 1926 To place a man in a multi stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon where the passengers can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne. I am bold enough to say that such a man made voyage will never occur regardless of all future advances. 1957 I do not foresee 'spaceships' to the moon or Mars. Mortals must live and die on Earth or within its atmosphere! 1952 As a growing competitor to the tube amplifier comes now the Bell Laboratories transistor, a three electrode germanium crystal of amazing amplification power, of wheat grain size and low cost. Yet its frequency limitations, a few hundred kilocycles, and its strict power limitations will never permit its general replacement of the Audion amplifier. 1952 I came, I saw, I invented it's that simple no need to sit and think it's all in your imagination.

            "text": "Robert Lomas is a British writer, physicist and business studies academic. He writes primarily about the history of Freemasonry as well as the Neolithic period, ancient engineering, and archaeoastronomy.  Career   In engineering and business studies  Lomas gained a First Class Honours degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Salford before being awarded a PhD for his research into solid state physics and crystalline structures. From here he went on to work on electronic weapons systems and emergency services command and control systems.He lectured on Information Systems at the University of Bradford's School of Management. According to his website, Lomas is a regular supporter of the Orkney International Science Festival, having lectured there, chaired sessions, and taken part in the school's support sessions over a period of eight years.  As a writer on masonic and other topics  Outside of his academic specialities, Lomas writes on the Neolithic period and archaeoastronomy, ancient mysteries, stone monuments, and megaliths, and on astronomical and astrological topics, as well as the history, ritual, and spiritual journey of Freemasonry. He has also written a biography of the electrical pioneer, Nikola Tesla.Lomas' main claim to notability is the authorship of several highly speculative works on the origins of Freemasonry. Positive reviewers admit that his works have attracted a great deal of criticism and even outrage but argue that his writing is loaded with all sorts of interesting theories and information that seem emblematic of an insider's point of view on the subject matter .Elements of his work have been described as hoaxes by members of the Freemasonry community. For example, the redaction of a document called The Masonic Testament by Lomas and co author Christopher Knight, in their Book of Hiram , from fragments of old manuscripts and ritual, has been described as An invention by the highly imaginative authors ... which has no historical validity . A review from The Square, reprinted on Lomas' website states that Turning the Hiram Key should be viewed as an invitation to think, rather than a prescriptive statement .

            "text": "Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X ray imaging. He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high voltage, high frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.  Early years  Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire , on 10 July O.S. 28 June 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla , was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Tesla's mother, uka Mandi , whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. uka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospi , where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro Hungarian Military Frontier. Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this mysterious phenomena made him want to know more of this wonderful force . Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four year term in three years, graduating in 1873.After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla's father , promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gra ac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.He enrolled at the Imperial Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. In his autobiography Tesla said he worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, Your son is a star of first rank. At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob P schl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating. But by his third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla wasn't studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing. Tesla's family did not hear from him after he left school. There was a rumor amongst his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor across the border in Slovenia and reported that encounter to Tesla's family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home and take up his education in Prague. Tesla returned to Gospi later that month when he was deported for not having a residence permit. Tesla's father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospi . In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospi for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.  Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange  Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Pusk s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.  Working at Edison In 1882, Tivadar Pusk s got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Soci t Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry sur Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.  Moving to the United States  In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 field engineers struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their Parisian being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that this is a damned good man . One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a 50,000 bonus to design twenty four different types of standard machines but it turned out to be a practical joke . Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping Tesla, you don't understand our American humor . The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that amount of cash on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying Good by to the Edison Machine Works .  Tesla Electric Light Manufacturing Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light Manufacturing. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features. The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for 2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery .  AC and the induction motor  In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1 3 to Tesla, 1 3 to Peck and Brown, and 1 3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices. In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current , a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long distance, high voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor . This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator less, rotating magnetic field based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market. In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for 60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of 2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of 2,000 per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60 cycle AC system that Tesla proposed , but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.  Market turmoil  Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a war of currents propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a 15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it was even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to deal with the bankers to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of 216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric .  New York laboratories  The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years working out of a series of workshop laboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street , the fourth floor of 33 35 South Fifth Avenue , and sixth and seventh floors of 46 48 East Houston Street . Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.  Tesla coil  In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886 1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. Tesla found this new discovery refreshing and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his oscillating transformer , with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high voltage, low current, high frequency alternating current electricity. He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.  Citizenship  On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.  Wireless lighting  After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires by conducting it through the Earth.Tesla served as a vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern day IEEE .  Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition  By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the Tesla Polyphase System . They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the Electricity Building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high voltage, high frequency alternating current to light wireless gas discharge lamps.An observer noted: Within the room were suspended two hard rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, where they produced so much wonder and astonishment .  Steam powered oscillating generator  During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.  Consulting on Niagara  In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two phase and three phase AC, high voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.  The Nikola Tesla Company  In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors since the mid 1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.  Lab fire  In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say? . After the fire Tesla moved to 46 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.  X ray experimentation  Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of invisible kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments . His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X ray image predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm R ntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.In March 1896, after hearing of R ntgen's discovery of X ray and X ray imaging , Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil . In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus .Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single node X ray producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him: Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his electric gun , Tesla said, The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations .  Radio remote control  In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer based radio control which he dubbed telautomaton to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate Teleautomatics in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.  Wireless power  From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications. At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of invisible light would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming hopelessly lost .By the mid 1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages long distances.  Colorado Springs  To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest 100,000 to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris. There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage. The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article entitled Talking With Planets , where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing intelligently controlled signals and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's European experiments in July 1899 Marconi may have transmitted the letter S in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled The Problem of Increasing Human Energy , appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.  Wardenclyffe  Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf Astoria's Palm Garden , The Players Club, and Delmonico's. In March 1901, he obtained 150,000 from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51 share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own. He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling vibrations throughout the globe . Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of 187 feet . In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf Astoria, which eventually amounted to 20,000 . He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.  Later years After Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after the great man died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.  Bladeless turbine  On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910 1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100 5,000 hp. Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis Chalmers. He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.  Wireless lawsuits  When World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for 1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.  Nobel Prize rumors  On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X rays . There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous ; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the 20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel prize .  Other awards, patents and ideas  Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include: Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava Elliott Cresson Medal Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I AIEE Edison Medal Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown John Scott Medal Order of the White Eagle Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion Medal of the University of Paris The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel. He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity, wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, saturating the schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.' The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries. In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an electric ray of tremendous frequency, with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen . Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. mile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly .In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take off and landing , which gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than 1,000. Although the aircraft has been described as impractical, it has early resemblances to the V 22 Osprey used by the US military. At this point Tesla closed his remaining office located at 350 Madison Ave, having moved there two years earlier.  Living circumstances  Tesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. He moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. He said that he had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. He spent over 2,000 to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed. Tesla stated: I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life. Tesla's unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company began paying him 125 per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being couched as a consulting fee to get around Tesla's aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of unspecified settlement . In any case, Westinghouse provided the funds for Tesla for the rest of his life.  Birthday press conferences  In 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption All the world's his power house noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims. At the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933 at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was violently opposed to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He called it teleforce , but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams . Tesla tried to attract interest of the US War Department, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.In 1935 at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure. He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called Telegeodynamics , using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In his 1937 Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.  Death  In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla's room, ignoring the do not disturb sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis . Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items. After a three day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating: His Tesla's thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's death ray , Trump found a 45 year old multidecade resistance box. On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio while violin pieces Ave Maria and Tamo daleko were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla's body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel in New York City.  Estate  In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovi , Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanovi 's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a gold plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.  Patents  Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.  Personal life and character   Appearance  Tesla was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 142 pounds , with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. His appearance was described by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane as almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly . He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities, an appearance he maintained so as to further his business relationships. He was also described as having light eyes, very big hands , and remarkably big thumbs.  Eidetic memory  Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. Blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail. Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.  Relationships  Tesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This new woman was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, In place of the soft voiced, a gentlewoman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me. Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work. Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force . His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul . Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink .Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as the most valuable patent since the telephone . At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight. He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress. When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life: He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.  Sleep habits  Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night. However, he did admit to dozing from time to time to recharge his batteries . During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... Tesla spoke animatedly, with pauses, as he ... work ed out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.  Work and dining habits  Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Tesla then telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla then resumed his work, often until 3:00 a.m. For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles per day. He curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, Suppose I made up my mind to murder you, he said, In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this? In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.  Views and beliefs   On experimental and theoretical physics  Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or sub atom that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Tesla believed that atoms are immutable they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying: I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view. In 1935 he described relativity as a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king and said his own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty time the speed of light.Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a dynamic theory of gravity that would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space . He stated that the theory was worked out in all details and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.  On society  Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook. This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics. Tesla expressed the belief that human pity had come to interfere with the natural ruthless workings of nature . Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a master race or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated: ... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal. In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by Queen Bees . He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post World War I environment in a printed article entitled Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War . Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.  On religion  Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a believer in the orthodox sense , said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance. He also said To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end and what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.  Literary works Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals. Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla , compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers. Many of Tesla's writings are freely available online, including the article The Problem of Increasing Human Energy , published in The Century Magazine in 1900, and the article Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency , published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.  Legacy and honors  Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.

It was presented to the United States by Yugoslavia in 1976 and is an identical copy of the monument standing in front of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.A plaque depicting a relief of Nikola Tesla is present on the Old City Hall in Zagreb, Croatia's capital, commemorating his proposal to build an alternating current power station, which he made to the city council. The plaque quotes Tesla's statement, given in the building on 24 May 1892, which reads: As a son of this country, I consider it my duty to help the City of Zagreb in every way, either through counsel or through action .In July 2001, a commemorative plaque honoring Nikola Tesla was installed on the fa ade of the New Yorker Hotel by the IEEE.The Nikola Tesla Memorial Centre in Smiljan, Croatia, opened in 2006. It features a statue of Tesla designed by sculptor Mile Bla evi .A monument of Tesla standing on a portion of an alternator was established at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. The monument was officially unveiled on 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church, Niagara Falls, and designed by Les Drysdale of Hamilton, Ontario. Drysdale's design was the winning design from an international competition.On 7 July 2006, on the corner of Masarykova and Preradovi eva streets in the Lower Town area in Zagreb, a monument of Tesla was unveiled. This monument was designed by Ivan Me trovi in 1952 and was transferred from the Zagreb based Ru er Bo kovi Institute where it had spent previous decades.In 2012 Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of web cartoon The Oatmeal, raised a total of 2,220,511 1,370,511 from a campaign and 850,000 from a New York State grant to buy the property where Wardenclyffe Tower once stood and eventually turn it into a museum. The group began negotiations to purchase the Long Island property from Agfa Corporation in October 2012. The purchase was completed in May 2013. The preservation effort and history of Wardenclyffe is the subject of a documentary by Tesla activist filmmaker Joseph Sikorski called Tower to the People Tesla's Dream at Wardenclyffe Continues.A monument of Tesla was unveiled in Baku in 2013.

            "text": "Three phase electric power is a common type of alternating current used in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution. It is a type of polyphase system employing three wires and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power. Three phase electrical power was developed in the 1880s by multiple people. Three phase power works by the voltage and currents being 120 degrees out of phase on the three wires. As an AC system it allows the voltages to be easily stepped up using transformers to high voltage for transmission, and back down for distribution, giving high efficiency. A three wire three phase circuit is usually more economical than an equivalent two wire single phase circuit at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a given amount of electrical power. Three phase power is mainly used directly to power large induction motors, other electric motors, and other heavy loads. Small loads often use only a two wire single phase circuit, which may be derived from a three phase system.  Terminology The conductors between a voltage source and a load are called lines, and the voltage between any two lines is called line voltage. The voltage measured between any line and neutral is called phase voltage. For example, for a 208 120 volt service, the line voltage is 208 Volts, and the phase voltage is 120 Volts.  History Polyphase power systems were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris, Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky, Jonas Wenstr m, John Hopkinson, William Stanley Jr., and Nikola Tesla in the late 1880s. Three phase power evolved out of electric motor development. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris was doing research on rotating magnetic fields. Ferraris experimented with different types of asynchronous electric motors. The research and his studies resulted in the development of an alternator, which may be thought of as an alternating current motor operating in reverse, so as to convert mechanical power into electric power . On 11 March 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin. Two months later Nikola Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 for a three phase electric motor design, application filed October 12, 1887. Figure 13 of this patent shows that Tesla envisaged his three phase motor being powered from the generator via six wires. These alternators operated by creating systems of alternating currents displaced from one another in phase by definite amounts, and depended on rotating magnetic fields for their operation. The resulting source of polyphase power soon found widespread acceptance. The invention of the polyphase alternator is key in the history of electrification, as is the power transformer. These inventions enabled power to be transmitted by wires economically over considerable distances. Polyphase power enabled the use of water power in remote places, thereby allowing the mechanical energy of the falling water to be converted to electricity, which then could be fed to an electric motor at any location where mechanical work needed to be done. This versatility sparked the growth of power transmission network grids on continents around the globe. Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky developed a three phase electrical generator and a three phase electric motor in 1888 and studied star and delta connections. His three phase three wire transmission system was displayed in Europe at the International Electro Technical Exhibition of 1891, where Dolivo Dobrovolsky used the system to transmit electric power at the distance of 176 km with 75 efficiency. In 1891 he also created a three phase transformer and short circuited induction motor. He designed the world's first three phase hydroelectric power plant in 1891.  Principle  In a symmetric three phase power supply system, three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference, but with a phase difference of one third of a cycle between each. The common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current carrying conductor called the neutral. Due to the phase difference, the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor. This phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load. It also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers . The amplitude of the voltage difference between two phases is             3          displaystyle sqrt 3   times the amplitude of the voltage of the individual phases. The symmetric three phase systems described here are simply referred to as three phase systems because, although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric three phase power systems , they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems. In a three phase system feeding a balanced and linear load, the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero. In other words, the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two, but with the opposite sign. The return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors. Constant power transfer and cancelling phase currents are possible with any number of phases, maintaining the capacity to conductor material ratio that is twice that of single phase power. However, two phases results in a less smooth current to the load , and more than three phases complicates infrastructure unnecessarily.Three phase systems may have a fourth wire, common in low voltage distribution. This is the neutral wire. The neutral allows three separate single phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying multiple single phase loads. The connections are arranged so that, as far as possible in each group, equal power is drawn from each phase. Further up the distribution system, the currents are usually well balanced. Transformers may be wired to have a four wire secondary and a three wire primary, while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondary side neutral currents.  Phase sequence  Wiring for the three phases is typically identified by colors which vary by country. The phases must be connected in the right order to achieve the intended direction of rotation of three phase motors. For example, pumps and fans do not work in reverse. Maintaining the identity of phases is required if two sources could be connected at the same time; a direct interconnect between two different phases is a short circuit.  Advantages As compared to a single phase AC power supply that uses two conductors , a three phase supply with no neutral and the same phase to ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires . Thus, the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled. The ratio of capacity to conductor material increases to 3:1 with an ungrounded three phase and center grounded single phase system . This leads to higher efficiency, lower weight, and cleaner waveforms. Three phase supplies have properties that make them desirable in electric power distribution systems: The phase currents tend to cancel out one another, summing to zero in the case of a linear balanced load. This makes it possible to reduce the size of the neutral conductor because it carries little or no current. With a balanced load, all the phase conductors carry the same current and so can be the same size. Power transfer into a linear balanced load is constant. In motor generator applications, this helps to reduce vibrations. Three phase systems can produce a rotating magnetic field with a specified direction and constant magnitude, which simplifies the design of electric motors, as no starting circuit is required.Most household loads are single phase. In North American residences, three phase power might feed an apartment block, while the household loads are connected as single phase. In lower density areas, a single phase might be used for distribution. Some high power domestic appliances such as electric stoves and clothes dryers are powered by a split phase system at 240 volts or from two phases of a three phase system at 208 volts.  Generation and distribution  At the power station, an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three AC electric currents, one from each coil of the generator. The windings are arranged such that the currents are at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one third cycle . The generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 Hz, depending on the country. At the power station, transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses. After further voltage conversions in the transmission network, the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers. Most automotive alternators generate three phase AC and rectify it to DC with a diode bridge.  Transformer connections A delta connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three phase system. A wye transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point. A single three phase transformer can be used, or three single phase transformers. In an open delta or V system, only two transformers are used. A closed delta made of three single phase transformers can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed. In open delta, each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase, therefore capacity is reduced to 87 . With one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87 efficiency, the capacity is 58 .Where a delta fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages, a grounding transformer may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground. Another variation is a corner grounded delta system, which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers.  Three wire and four wire circuits  There are two basic three phase configurations: wye and delta . As shown in the diagram, a delta configuration requires only three wires for transmission but a wye configuration may have a fourth wire. The fourth wire, if present, is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded. The three wire and four wire designations do not count the ground wire present above many transmission lines, which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under normal use. A four wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the common star point of all supply windings. In such a system, all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral. Other non symmetrical systems have been used. The four wire wye system is used when a mixture of single phase and three phase loads are to be served, such as mixed lighting and motor loads. An example of application is local distribution in Europe , where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral . When a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents, the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances. Electrical engineers try to design the three phase power system for any one location so that the power drawn from each of three phases is the same, as far as possible at that site. Electrical engineers also try to arrange the distribution network so the loads are balanced as much as possible, since the same principles that apply to individual premises also apply to the wide scale distribution system power. Hence, every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute the power drawn on each of the three phases over a large number of premises so that, on average, as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply. For domestic use, some countries such as the UK may supply one phase and neutral at a high current to one property, while others such as Germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer, but at a lower fuse rating, typically 40 63 A per phase, and rotated to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase. Based on wye and delta connection. Generally, there are four different types of three phase transformer winding connections for transmission and distribution purposes. wye  wye is used for small current and high voltage. Delta  Delta is used for large currents and low voltages. Delta  wye is used for step up transformers i.e., at generating stations. wye  Delta is used for step down transformers i.e., at the end of the transmission.In North America, a high leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta connected transformer feeding the load is center tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram. This setup produces three different voltages: If the voltage between the center tap and each of the top and bottom taps is 120 V , the voltage across the phase and anti phase lines is 240 V , and the neutral to high leg voltage is 208 V .The reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field. However, the premises concerned will also require the normal North American 120 V supplies, two of which are derived between the neutral and either of the center tapped phase points.  Balanced circuits In the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads. Examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current, and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads. In a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other. With V1 as our reference and V3 lagging V2 lagging V1, using angle notation, and VLN the voltage between the line and the neutral we have:                         V          1                                   V          LN                       0                        ,                       V          2                                   V          LN                                  120                             ,                       V          3                                   V          LN                                  120                             .                 displaystyle begin aligned V 1 V text LN angle 0 circ , V 2 V text LN angle 120 circ , V 3 V text LN angle 120 circ . end aligned  These voltages feed into either a wye or delta connected load.  Wye  The voltage seen by the load will depend on the load connection; for the wye case, connecting each load to a phase voltages gives:                         I          1                                              V            1                                   Z             total                                              ,                       I          2                                              V            2                                   Z             total                                                       ,                       I          3                                              V            3                                   Z             total                                                       ,                 displaystyle begin aligned I 1  frac V 1 left Z text total right angle , 2pt I 2  frac V 2 left Z text total right angle left , 2pt I 3  frac V 3 left Z text total right angle left , end aligned  where Ztotal is the sum of line and load impedances , and is the phase of the total impedance . The phase angle difference between voltage and current of each phase is not necessarily 0 and is dependent on the type of load impedance, Zy. Inductive and capacitive loads will cause current to either lag or lead the voltage. However, the relative phase angle between each pair of lines will still be 120 . By applying Kirchhoff's current law to the neutral node, the three phase currents sum to the total current in the neutral line.

Inspection of a phasor diagram, or conversion from phasor notation to complex notation, illuminates how the difference between two line to neutral voltages yields a line to line voltage that is greater by a factor of 3. As a delta configuration connects a load across phases of a transformer, it delivers the line to line voltage difference, which is 3 times greater than the line to neutral voltage delivered to a load in the wye configuration. As the power transferred is V2 Z, the impedance in the delta configuration must be 3 times what it would be in a wye configuration for the same power to be transferred.  Single phase loads Except in a high leg delta system and a corner grounded delta system, single phase loads may be connected across any two phases, or a load can be connected from phase to neutral. Distributing single phase loads among the phases of a three phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers. In a symmetrical three phase four wire, wye system, the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral. The voltage between line conductors is 3 times the phase conductor to neutral voltage:         V      LL                3          V      LN        .     displaystyle V text LL  sqrt 3 V text LN . The currents returning from the customers' premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire. If the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases, the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero. Any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently. If the supply neutral is broken, phase to neutral voltage is no longer maintained. Phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage, and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage, up to the phase to phase voltage. A high leg delta provides phase to neutral relationship of VLL 2 VLN , however, LN load is imposed on one phase. A transformer manufacturer's page suggests that LN loading not exceed 5 of transformer capacity.Since 3 1.73, defining VLN as 100 gives VLL 100 1.73 173 . If VLL was set as 100 , then VLN 57.7 .  Unbalanced loads  When the currents on the three live wires of a three phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120 phase angle, the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system. The method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems.  Non linear loads  With linear loads, the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases. Gas discharge lamps and devices that utilize rectifier capacitor front end such as switch mode power supplies, computers, office equipment and such produce third order harmonics that are in phase on all the supply phases. Consequently, such harmonic currents add in the neutral in a wye system transformer in a delta system , which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current.  Three phase loads  An important class of three phase load is the electric motor. A three phase induction motor has a simple design, inherently high starting torque and high efficiency. Such motors are applied in industry for many applications. A three phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single phase motor of the same voltage class and rating, and single phase AC motors above 10 HP are uncommon. Three phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions.Resistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three phase systems. Electric lighting may also be similarly connected. Line frequency flicker in light is detrimental to high speed cameras used in sports event broadcasting for slow motion replays. It can be reduced by evenly spreading line frequency operated light sources across the three phases so that the illuminated area is lit from all three phases. This technique was applied successfully at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Rectifiers may use a three phase source to produce a six pulse DC output. The output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and, unlike single phase, does not drop to zero between pulses. Such rectifiers may be used for battery charging, electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of DC motors. Zig zag transformers may make the equivalent of six phase full wave rectification, twelve pulses per cycle, and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components, while improving the quality of the resulting DC. One example of a three phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores. In many European countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three phase feed with permanent connection. Individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single phase circuit if three phase is not available. Other usual three phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters. Homes in Europe and the UK have standardized on a nominal 230 V between any phase and ground. Most groups of houses are fed from a three phase street transformer so that individual premises with above average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection.  Phase converters Phase converters are used when three phase equipment needs to be operated on a single phase power source. They are used when three phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable. Such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied, allowing speed control. Some railway locomotives use a single phase source to drive three phase motors fed through an electronic drive.A rotary phase converter is a three phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three phase voltages. When properly designed, these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three phase motor on a single phase source. In such a device, the energy storage is performed by the inertia of the rotating components. An external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft. A three phase generator can be driven by a single phase motor. This motor generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion, but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses. The motor generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery powered DC motor; such a combination will deliver nearly constant power compared to the temporary frequency drop experienced with a standby generator set gives until the standby generator kicks in. Capacitors and autotransformers can be used to approximate a three phase system in a static phase converter, but the voltage and phase angle of the additional phase may only be useful for certain loads. Variable frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three phase supply from single phase input power.  Testing Verification of the phase sequence in a circuit is of considerable practical importance. Two sources of three phase power must not be connected in parallel unless they have the same phase sequence, for example, when connecting a generator to an energized distribution network or when connecting two transformers in parallel. Otherwise, the interconnection will behave like a short circuit, and excess current will flow. The direction of rotation of three phase motors can be reversed by interchanging any two phases; it may be impractical or harmful to test a machine by momentarily energizing the motor to observe its rotation. Phase sequence of two sources can be verified by measuring voltage between pairs of terminals and observing that terminals with very low voltage between them will have the same phase, whereas pairs that show a higher voltage are on different phases. Where the absolute phase identity is not required, phase rotation test instruments can be used to identify the rotation sequence with one observation. The phase rotation test instrument may contain a miniature three phase motor, whose direction of rotation can be directly observed through the instrument case. Another pattern uses a pair of lamps and an internal phase shifting network to display the phase rotation. Another type of instrument can be connected to a de energized three phase motor and can detect the small voltages induced by residual magnetism, when the motor shaft is rotated by hand. A lamp or other indicator lights to show the sequence of voltages at the terminals for the given direction of shaft rotation.  Alternatives to three phase Split phase electric power Used when three phase power is not available and allows double the normal utilization voltage to be supplied for high power loads. Two phase electric power Uses two AC voltages, with a 90 electrical degree phase shift between them. Two phase circuits may be wired with two pairs of conductors, or two wires may be combined, requiring only three wires for the circuit. Currents in the common conductor add to 1.4 times the current in the individual phases, so the common conductor must be larger. Two phase and three phase systems can be interconnected by a Scott T transformer, invented by Charles F. Scott. Very early AC machines, notably the first generators at Niagara Falls, used a two phase system, and some remnant two phase distribution systems still exist, but three phase systems have displaced the two phase system for modern installations. Monocyclic power An asymmetrical modified two phase power system used by General Electric around 1897, championed by Charles Proteus Steinmetz and Elihu Thomson. This system was devised to avoid patent infringement. In this system, a generator was wound with a full voltage single phase winding intended for lighting loads and with a small fraction winding that produced a voltage in quadrature with the main windings. The intention was to use this power wire additional winding to provide starting torque for induction motors, with the main winding providing power for lighting loads. After the expiration of the Westinghouse patents on symmetrical two phase and three phase power distribution systems, the monocyclic system fell out of use; it was difficult to analyze and did not last long enough for satisfactory energy metering to be developed. High phase order systems Have been built and tested for power transmission. Such transmission lines typically would use six or twelve phases. High phase order transmission lines allow transfer of slightly less than proportionately higher power through a given volume without the expense of a high voltage direct current converter at each end of the line. However, they require correspondingly more pieces of equipment. DC AC was historically used because it could be easily transformed to higher voltages for long distance transmission. However modern electronics can raise the voltage of DC with high efficiency, and DC lacks skin effect which permits transmission wires to be lighter and cheaper and so high voltage direct current gives lower losses over long distances.  Color codes  Conductors of a three phase system are usually identified by a color code, to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors. Colors used may adhere to International Standard IEC 60446 , older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, different color codes are used for grounded and ungrounded systems.  See also   Notes   References   External links AC Power History and Timeline",

The structure, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, is a 47 story 625 ft Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver, which was completed in 1931. The building was the world's tallest hotel from 1931 until 1963 when it was surpassed by Moscow's Hotel Ukraina by 23 feet . An icon of glamour and luxury, the current Waldorf Astoria is one of the world's most prestigious and best known hotels. Waldorf Astoria Hotels Resorts is a division of Hilton Hotels, and a portfolio of high end properties around the world now operates under the name, including in New York City. Both the exterior and the interior of the Waldorf Astoria are designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official landmarks. The original Waldorf Astoria was built in two stages along Fifth Avenue and opened in 1893; it was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. Particularly after its relocation, the Waldorf Astoria gained international renown for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. After World War II, it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a 150 million renovation by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s. The Anbang Insurance Group of China purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US 1.95 billion in 2014, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. The Waldorf was closed in 2017 and its upper floor hotel rooms were converted into 375 condominiums called The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. The renovated structure will retain 375 hotel rooms on the lowest 18 floors. The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini suites, while the Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. Several of the luxury suites are named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them such as the Cole Porter Suite, the Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the MacArthur Suite, and the Churchill Suite. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, is designed with Georgian style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. The hotel has three main restaurants: Peacock Alley, The Bull, and Bear Steak House, and La Chine a new Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar's Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry's Bar, also located in the hotel, is named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston.  Name The name of the hotel is ultimately derived from the town of Walldorf, which lies in south west Germany, close to Mannheim and Heidelberg. Walldorf is the ancestral home of the prominent German American Astor family who originated there. In German, Waldorf means Whale Village , and Walldorf means Rampart Village . The name of the town, however, formed through an elision: Walddorf , meaning Forest Village , became Walldorf . An oak tree in the coat of arms of the town refers to this etymology. The hotel was originally known as the Waldorf Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, Meet Me at the Hyphen . The sign was changed to a double hyphen, looking similar to an equals sign, by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949. The double hyphen visually represents Peacock Alley , the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by its parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts chain. The hotel has since been known as the Waldorf Astoria New York, without any hyphen, though this is sometimes shortened to the Waldorf Astoria.  History   Original buildings   Creation  The original hotel started as two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13 story, 450 room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood 225 feet high, with a frontage of about 100 feet on Fifth Avenue, with an area of 69,475 square feet . The original hotel was described as having a lofty stone and brick exterior , which was animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets . William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming , resembling a typical German professor with his close cropped beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince nez glasses on a black silk cord . Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed. At first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was Astor's Folly , with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. It soon became a major success, earning 4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period. William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but with Boldt's assistance, Waldorf's cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17 story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect them; it was named so by New Yorkers for the parade of well dressed, well to do people who strutted between the two fashionable buildings. The hotel subsequently became known as the Waldorf Astoria , the largest hotel in the world at the time.  Heyday  With a telephone in every room and first class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of the socially prominent wealthy upper crust of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family . It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was the guest is always right , became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as Oscar of the Waldorf , ma tre d'h tel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland 10 years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf, and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of the Waldorf , a 900 page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, eggs Benedict, and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees . In 1902, Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf Astoria. The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some 250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck, and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time, the hotel had 7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902, a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909, banquets attended by hundreds were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.The United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912, and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room, before moving on to Washington, D.C. John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill fated journey. Seven senators were present on the subcommittee, including William Alden Smith as chair, Jonathan Bourne , Theodore E. Burton , Duncan U. Fletcher , Francis G. Newlands , George Clement Perkins , and Furnifold McLendel Simmons . The composition of the subcommittee was carefully chosen to represent the conservative, moderate, and liberal wings of the two parties. In 1919, restaurateur Louis Sherry announced an alliance with the Waldorf Astoria that involved both his candies and catering services. Although it was not disclosed at that time, at some point, ownership of Louis Sherry Inc. was significantly vested in Boomer duPont interests , a reference to Lucius M. Boomer, then chairman of the Waldorf Astoria, and T. Coleman du Pont. Upon his death that year, William Waldorf Astor was reputed to have been worth 200 million, which he left in trust for his two sons Waldorf and John Jacob. His half share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel at the time were reported to have been worth 10 million. On the evening of November 15, 1926, the National Broadcasting Company broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf Astoria. Among the entertainers heard by radio listeners was Will Rogers. The network became the Red Network on January 1, 1927, when NBC launched its second network, designated the Blue Network. An antitrust suit forced the sale of the Blue Network in 1942; it became the American Broadcasting Company.The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the Hotel Astor , St. Regis , the Knickerbocker , and the Savoy Plaza Hotel . By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family finally sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.  Current building   Early years and international politics  The idea of a new Waldorf Astoria hotel was based on the concept that a large, opulent hotel should be available in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929, as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, which had operated a power plant for Grand Central Terminal on the site. New York Central had promised 10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.The new building opened on Park Avenue, between East 49th and East 50th streets, on October 1, 1931. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one third of which were leased as private residences. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality...marks the measure of nation's growth in power, in comfort and in artistry...an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation . About 2,000 people were in the ballroom listening to this speech, but by the end of the business day, the 2,200 room hotel had only 500 occupancies. The Waldorf Astoria did not begin operating at a profit until 1939. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure to whom Tony Rey referred as the greatest hotelman of his era . Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947.Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as comparable to great national institutions and a living symbol deep within our collective consciousness . It had the greatest banquet department in the world at the time according to restaurateur Tom Margittai, with the center of activity being the Grand Ballroom. On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the cream of New York's literary world attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor Pearl S. Buck, the author of The Good Earth, which was the best selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932. One dinner alone, a relatively small dinner attended by some 50 people in June 1946, raised over 250,000. During the 1930s and 1940s the hotel's guests were also entertained at the elegant Starlight Roof nightclub by the Waldorf Astoria Orchestra and such noted musicians as: Xavier Cugat, Eddie Duchin, Lester Lanin and Glenn Miller.The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging Cold War and international relations during the postwar years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, Winston Churchill attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor Thomas E. Dewey, 10 days after making his famous Iron Curtain speech, and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the Big Four Conference was held in J rgine Boomer's apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the future of Eastern Europe. On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the Hollywood film industry, including various film executives such as Louis B. Mayer of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures, Spyros Skouras of 20th Century Fox, Albert Warner of Warner Bros., and Eric Johnston, the head of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the Waldorf Statement, banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry. The statement was a response to the contempt of Congress charges against the so called Hollywood Ten . From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging Cold War and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The conference came at a time when deep anti Communist sentiment and suspicion of the Soviet Union existed in the United States, following the Berlin Blockade and the Czechoslovak coup d' tat the previous year. The event was organized by the struggling American Communist Party. It was sponsored by many individuals who were not Stalinists, such as Leonard Bernstein, Marlon Brando, Albert Einstein, and Aaron Copland. They joined with the intention of promoting peace, and the Party found them useful. The conference was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich, and writer Alexsander Fadeyev. Tension mounted during the controversial event, and culminated when Shostakovich, in front of a crowd of some 800 people, launched a scathing attack on western civilization, announcing, a small clique of hatemongers was preparing world public opinion for the transition from the cold war to outright aggression . The event was picketed in a counterattack by anti Stalinists running under the banner of America for Intellectual Freedom, and prominent individuals such as Irving Howe, Dwight Macdonald, Mary McCarthy, Robert Lowell, and Norman Mailer angrily denounced Stalinism at the hotel.On June 21, 1948, a press conference at the hotel introduced the LP record.In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist Yigael Yadin met secretly with the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Mar Samuel in the basement of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel. The scrolls were kept in a vault at the Waldorf Astoria branch of New York's Chemical Bank. At the request of the Israeli government, respected biblical scholar Dr. Harry Orlinsky examined the scrolls and verified their authenticity; Yadin paid 250,000 for all four.Restaurateur George Lang began working at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1955, and on December 13, 1955, he helped organize the American Theatre Wing's First Night Ball to celebrate Helen Hayes's 50th year in show business. He did much to organize dinners at the Waldorf to assist Hungarian issues and relief. On one occasion, an event was attended by Edward G. Robinson and pianist Doklady and some 60,000 were raised.  April in Paris Ball  The April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Franco American relations, to share cultures, and to help assist the US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring, he would make it in October . After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues.The ball was designed to cater to very, very high class people according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US 100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US 5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes, and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags, and a pedigreed poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US 106,000 worth of prizes were given out. Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from taxes, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20 going towards French charities. A staff of three people was paid full time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated, We charge the most, give the most, and make the most it's a success formula . Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer. The Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a three hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by Stuart Chaney , depicting a 12th century scene of troubadours at the court of Eleanor of Aquitane, Henry VIII's meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Louis XIV at Versailles, and a fashion show of 40 creations by Dior, Fath, Balmain, Desses, and Givenchy . French stars Juliette Gr co, Jean Sablon, Beatrice Lillie, John Loder and many others were flown over for the ball. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Senator John F. Kennedy, his wife, Jackie, and Marilyn Monroe, who paid 100 each and donated 130,000 to charities. The following year, the ballroom was decorated with 30 feet high chestnut trees, earning US 170,000 for charities. The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century. Genuine circus costumes from the period were flown over from France, and the ball was attended by Marlene Dietrich, who performed two Maurice Chevalier songs, wearing a top hat, trousers, a waistcoat, and white gloves.  Later history  On May 6, 1963, Time celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel. The event was attended by some 1500 celebrities, including General Douglas MacArthur, Jean Monnet, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Bob Hope, Joe Louis, David O. Selznick, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Edward Kennedy, Henry Ford II, and many others. On October 4, 1965, Pope Paul VI made the first papal visit to the United States. He met with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the Waldorf Astoria. In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel, where they encountered difficulties with the staff of the Waldorf Astoria. Due to the band's reputation for trashing their hotel rooms and rowdy behavior, the Waldorf demanded that they pay cash upfront. However, following their gig, the band members were refused access to their hotel rooms, where their luggage was being kept. Tony Fletcher, in his biography on Keith Moon, claims that Moon challenged the staff and blew the door to their room off the hinges with his cherry bombs and retrieved their luggage, which prompted The Who to be shown the door and banned from the hotel for life. However, clearly the ban was later revoked as they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction at the Waldorf on January 17, 1990. Soon after the opening of the hotel in 1931, hotelier Conrad Hilton, almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, The Greatest of Them All . He acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949. The Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972.In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, a 20 car motorcade, with eight shotgun toting police marksmen aboard in bullet proof vests brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Waldorf was on red alert, and German Shepherd sniffer dogs were brought in prior to his arrival to look for possible bombs. Fifteen suites of the hotel were reserved for the Palestine Liberation Organization delegation. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted Vice President, and a 90 minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO leader Yasser Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria, and in 1985, the NBA held its first ever draft lottery between nonplayoff teams at the Starlight Room. The lottery was for the 1985 NBA Draft in which Patrick Ewing was the consensus number one pick.Lee Jablin, of Harman Jablin Architects, fully renovated and upgraded the historical property to its original grandeur during the mid 1980s through the mid 1990s in a 150 million renovation. The hotel was named an official New York City Landmark in 1993. On May 27, 2001, the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America had a grand banquet at the hotel to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia's conversion to Christianity, with Ambassador Edward Djerejian as guest speaker. On May 7, 2004, a press conference was held by MGM, discussing Steve Martin's The Pink Panther of the Pink Panther series. The 5th Annual DGA Honors Gala was held at the Waldorf on September 29.In 2006, Hilton launched Waldorf Astoria Hotels Resorts, a brand named for the hotel. Branches of the Waldorf Astoria are now located in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana in the United States, and abroad in France, Israel, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. In 2006, Hilton was reported to be considering opening a new Waldorf Astoria hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, the Waldorf Astoria opened the Guerlain and Spa Chakra, Inc. spa at the hotel, as part of the Waldorf Astoria Collection, which offers a body massage and facial using Guerlain's age defying Orchidee Imperiale skincare . The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria continues to operate as a boutique hotel within a hotel .In October 2014, Chinese company Anbang Insurance Group was announced to have purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for US 1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums, The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. Under the plan, some of the hotel's rooms will be turned into apartments, with the remainder of the rooms remaining hotel suites operated by Hilton. The final event in the Grand Ballroom, on February 28, 2017, was a charity gala celebrating NewYork Presbyterian Hospital with Stevie Wonder playing for the sold out crowd. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017. The hotel's restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and the recently opened La Chine, closed along with the hotel; they will reopen when the renovation is completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission voted unanimously to list the interiors of the hotel's famous public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from major alterations.In November 2019 it was announced that the 375 condos in the Waldorf Astoria would go on sale starting in early 2020, while the 375 remaining hotel rooms would not reopen until 2021. The hotel rooms were set to be on the lowest 18 floors. Following Anbang's bankruptcy in 2020, Dajia Insurance Group Co. took over Anbang's American assets, including the Waldorf Astoria. In March 2020, sales started on the 375 condos in the Waldorf Astoria. By late 2020, the hotel was set to open at the end of 2022; however, as of March 2021, the hotel was expected to open in early 2023. The renovation of the Waldorf Astoria stalled in mid 2022 as the project exceeded its 2 billion budget. According to the Wall Street Journal, this had pushed the renovation back to at least 2024.  Architecture  The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, as part of the Terminal City complex, wherein buildings like the Waldorf Astoria using air rights to the space above the tracks. Travel America stated: To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth.  Form and facade  The 625 ft hotel, with 47 stories, was the tallest and largest hotel in the world for several years after its completion. The structure uses 1,585 cubic feet of black marble imported from Belgium, 600 cubic feet of Brech Montalto and 260 cubic feet of Alps Green from Italy, and some 300 antique mantles. In addition, 200 railroad cars brought some 800,000 cubic feet of limestone for the building's facing, 27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and 2.595 million square feet of terra cotta and gypsum block.The massing of the hotel rises from a pair of 20 story high slabs at the base, which run parallel to Park and Lexington Avenues. The slabs contain setbacks at the 18th story on their western elevation and at the 13th and 16th stories on the eastern elevation. The slab on Park Avenue contained a retractable metal and glass roof above the 18th and 19th stories, above the Starlight Roof nightclub. The slabs are covered with gray limestone and lack colorful ornamentation. The facade of the lower stories is divided vertically into numerous bays, which contain recessed windows and spandrel panels. There are three patterns of spandrels on the western and eastern elevations of the facade, facing Park and Lexington Avenues respectively. Gilded letters with the hotel's name are placed above the entrances on either avenue. On Park Avenue, the letters are flanked by representations of maidens.Above the 20th story, the hotel rises as a single slab to the 42nd story. this slab is oriented parallel to the side streets and is also faced in gray limestone. The 42 story slab is topped by a pair of towers with copper pinnacles. The upper stories of the towers are faced in brick, which was intentionally designed to match the stonework on the lower stories. The use of brick led many to believe that the builders ran out of money. The Waldorf Astoria's facade has undergone few changes over the years, except for the installation of openings for air conditioners; replacement of aluminum windows; and modifications to storefronts, marquees, and entrances at ground level.  Interior  Such is the architectural and cultural heritage of the hotel that tours are conducted of the hotel for guests. Frommer's has cited the hotel as an icon of luxury , and highlights the wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade , the stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier , and the free standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures in the main lobby. They compare the decor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush carpeted, which seem to go on forever .  Lobby floor  Unlike in other American hotels, the lobby floor of the Waldorf Astoria is raised one story above ground level, which both created the impression of grandeur and allowed storefronts to be placed at ground level. The main lobby, at the center of the lobby floor, measures 82 by 62 feet across and 22 feet high; it originally had four wood paneled walls with archways. The lobby is furnished with polished nickel bronze cornices and rockwood stone. The grand clock, a 4000 lb bronze, was built by the Goldsmith's Company of London originally for the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago, but was purchased by the Waldorf owners. Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Harrison, and Grover Cleveland, and Queen Victoria and Benjamin Franklin. A shield once belonging to the Waldorf was moved to the Alexis restaurant on W. Franklin Street in 1984. Initially, the north wall of the lobby had a porter and cigar store; the east wall had a transportation desk; and the south wall had a cashier's desk and front office desk. Special desks in the lobby are allocated to transportation and theatre, where exclusive tickets to many of the city's prominent theaters can be purchased.In the main foyer is a chandelier measuring 10 feet by 10 feet .The elevator is furnished with paneled pollard oak and Carpathian elm. The Park Avenue lobby contains classical style square columns as well as pastoral murals by Louis Rigal. The lobby floor contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth's Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry's Bar. From 1992 to 2013, Kenneth, sometimes called the world's first celebrity hairdresser, famed for creating Jacqueline Kennedy's bouffant in 1961, moved his hairdressing and beauty salon to the Waldorf after a 1990 fire destroyed his shop on 19 East 54th Street.The main lobby is surrounded on all four sides by a system of secondary corridors. The eastern corridor allowed direct access from Lexington Avenue to the various rooms on the third and fourth stories. The architects used different colors of marbles for the lobby floor lounges to distinguish them from each other. The west lounge has French walnut burl panels separated by red French marble; the former north lounge had yellow Siena marble; the south lounge has white gray Breche Montalto marble; and the east arcade has serpentine cladding. Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter's Steinway Sons floral print decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, Liza Minnelli, George M. Cohan, and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel.  Third and fourth floors  The third floor contains the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room, and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end of season awards banquet was held at the Waldorf Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black tie charitable affair co chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria Hungary which celebrated the enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that I leave my dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time . Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October, the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana . It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the Starlight Roof . Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. Louis Armstrong performed at the Waldorf for two weeks in March 1971. This was Armstrong's last performance. Since 1986, most Rock Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies have been held in the Grand Ballroom. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider.The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and most of the suites were named after guests including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vert s, Louis XVI, and Cole Porter. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday night card games were played. Before its 2021 renovation, the hotel had a model of one of the living rooms of apartment 31A, then the suite of former U.S. President Herbert Hoover. A living room from the suite is also recreated as a display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa.  Rooms and suites  The Waldorf Astoria and Towers has a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 minisuites, 17 of which were classified as Astoria Level , which are upgraded rooms with deluxe amenities and complimentary access to the Astoria Lounge. The Waldorf Towers, from the 28th floor up to the 42nd, had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites, with one to four bedrooms. As of the late 1990s, the hotel had a housekeeping staff of nearly 400, with 150 day maids and 24 night maids. The rooms retain the original Art Deco motifs, although each room is decorated differently. The guests rooms, classified as Deluxe, Superior, and Luxury, feature Waldorf Serenity beds and have a marble bath or shower with amenities designed by Salvatore Ferragamo. The suites featured king or double beds and start in size at 450 square feet . The smallest are the one bedroom suites, which range from 450 to 600 square feet , then the Signature Suites have a separate living room and one or two bedrooms, which range from 750 to 900 square feet , and finally, the suites of The Towers are generally larger and costlier still, and have a twice daily maid service. The Tower suites are divided into standard ones, The Towers Luxury Series, which have their own sitting room, the Towers Penthouse Series, the Towers Presidential Style Suites, and finally the most expensive Presidential Suite on the 35th floor. The Penthouse Series contains three suites, The Penthouse, The Cole Porter Suite, and The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They start at 1,800 square feet in size, with two or more bedrooms, and are fitted with a kitchen and dining room which can accommodate for 8 12 guests. The Towers Presidential Style Suites are divided into the MacArthur Suite and the Churchill Suite, and have their own grand entry foyer. Like the Penthouse Series, they have their own kitchen and dining room. The 2,250 square feet Presidential Suite is designed with Georgian style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It has three large bedrooms and three bathrooms, and boasts numerous treasures, including the desk of General MacArthur and rocking chair of John F. Kennedy.  Other facilities  A 2,500 square feet fitness center is on the 5th floor. The 21.5 million Waldorf Astoria Guerlain Spa was inaugurated on September 1, 2008 on the 19th floor. It features 16 treatment rooms and two relaxation lounges. The hotel has its own Business Center, a 1,150 square feet digital facility, where guests can access the Internet and photocopy. In 2004 the hotel launched a line of products in keeping with the Art Deco style of the hotel, reportedly becoming the first individual hotel in the world to have its own merchandise collection.  Secret railway track  The hotel has its own railway platform, Track 61, that was part of the New York Central Railroad , and was connected to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. There is a pedestrian entrance from E 50th St., just to the left of the Waldorf Towers entrance. However, it is rarely opened to the public.  Restaurants and cuisine  The Waldorf Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service and was the first major hotel in the world to hire women as chefs, beginning in 1931. An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975. As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year and got through 27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar, 380,000 pints of strawberries annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some 3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut, 1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eaten on gold china plates. One 1973 feast by the Explorer's Club devoured hippo meat, a 4 foot alligator, a baby shark, an amberjack tuna, a boa, wild boar hams, 480 pieces of breaded fried cod tongues and cheeks, antelope steaks, two boxes of Chinese rabbit, and 20 pounds of rattlesnake. The hotel has three main restaurants, Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and Oscar's Brasserie, as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese Inagiku. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants. Peacock Alley, situated in the heart of the lobby, features an Art Deco design with gilded ceilings and includes the main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. It is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes. Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces. The Bull and Bear Steak House is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style, and has a den like atmosphere, and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef. It has won awards from the National Restaurant Association and Holiday magazine. Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for Fox Business Happy Hour, presented live between 5 and 6 pm. The Bull and Bear Bar is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, and adventurers such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson. Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent the successful men of Wall Street. The Inagiku, meaning the rice chrysanthemum , serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by Henry Look of San Francisco, the restaurant has four distinctly different rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple. Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox tatami rooms. Oscar's Brasserie, overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by Adam Tihany. The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar. The Waldorf salad a salad made with apples, walnuts, celery, grapes, and mayonnaise or a mayonnaise based dressing was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar. The original recipe, however, did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in The Rector Cook Book in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his Oscar's Sauce , which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel. Another of the hotel's specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts.Sir Harry's Bar is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir Harry Johnston . In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a plush African safari design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with zebra striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent cane furnishings . It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a 23 feet by 8 feet ebony bar as of the early 1990s. Frank Sinatra frequented Sir Harry's Bar for many years. In 1991, while drinking at Sir Harry's with Jilly Rizzo and Steve Lawrence, he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, Don't you see I'm on my own time here? You asshole. What's wrong with you? The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained.  Cocktail books  Albert Stevens Crockett, the hotel's veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book Old Waldorf Bar Days in 1931 during Prohibition and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was an homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett's takes on the original hand written leather bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted.In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book , in response to the repeal of the Volstead Act and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the Cuban Concoctions and Jamaican Jollifers chapters. These books became reference books on the subject of pre Prohibition cocktails and their culture.In 2016, the long time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, Frank Caiafa, added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa's The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book includes all of the recipes in Crockett's books; many of the hotel's most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations. In 2017, it was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Beverage Book.Other notable books with connections to the hotel include Drinks by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel's notable recipes. Tschirky himself compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own book 100 Famous Cocktails , a selection of favorites from Crockett's books. Finally, hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote Bottoms Up in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day.  Notable residents and guests   Leaders and businesspeople  On the 100th anniversary of the hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there. From its inception, the Waldorf was always a must stay hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred year old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan, and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year. In modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty. An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floor mats. One early wealthy resident was Chicago businessman J. W. Gates who would gamble on stocks on Wall Street and play poker at the hotel. He paid up to 50,000 a year to hire suites at the hotel. Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe Coburg and Gotha was invited by Waldorf president Lucius Bloomer to stay at the hotel in the 1920s. Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre, and Fidel Castro once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away. While serving as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed First Lady also once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100 watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight; she further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available. Postmaster General James Farley occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there between 1967 and his death in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion. Since Hoover, every President of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite. The official residence of the United States' Permanent Representative to the United Nations, an unnamed 42nd floor apartment, was located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. On June 17, 2015, however, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to The New York Palace Hotel.Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and member of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another connection with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza Debayle and his wife Hope Portocarrero had a penthouse suite at the Waldorf Towers, where Somoza received political leaders.  Celebrities  The hotel has had many well knowns under its roof throughout its history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Liv Ullmann, Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, Ray Bolger, John Wayne, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Muhammad Ali, Vince Lombardi, Judy Garland, Sonny Werblin, Greer Garson, Harold Lloyd, Liberace, Burt Reynolds, Robert Montgomery, Cesar Romero, and many others. Due to the number of high profile guests staying at the hotel at any one time, author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Towers as a kind of vertical Beverly Hills. On any one given night you might find Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra or Zsa Zsa Gabor staying there . Gabor married Conrad Hilton in 1941. During the 1930s, gangster Benjamin Bugsy Siegel owned an apartment at the Waldorf, and Frank Costello was said to have got his haircut and nails done in the Barber's Shop at the Waldorf. Around the time of World War I, inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the earlier Waldorf Astoria.In 1955, Marilyn Monroe and her husband, Arthur Miller stayed at the hotel for several months, but due to costs of trying to finance her production company Marilyn Monroe Productions , only being paid 1,500 a week for her role in The Seven Year Itch and being suspended from 20th Century Fox for walking out on Fox after creative differences, living at the hotel became too costly and Monroe had to move into a different hotel in New York City. Around the same time that Monroe lived in the hotel, Cole Porter and his wife Linda Lee Thomas had an apartment in the Waldorf Towers, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter's 1934 song You're the Top , contains the lyric, You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad . The Cole Porter Suite, Suite 33A, was the place where Porter lived and entertained for a period. Frank Sinatra paid nearly 1 million a year to keep it as his suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988, which he called home when out of Los Angeles. Sinatra took over part of the hotel during the filming of The First Deadly Sin in 1980. Grace Kelly and Rainier III were regular guests at the hotel. At one time Kelly was reputed to be in love with the hotel banquet manager of the Waldorf, Claudius Charles Philippe. Elizabeth Taylor frequented the hotel, and would often attend galas at the hotel to talk about her various causes. Her visits were excitedly awaited by the hotel staff, who would prepare long in advance. Taylor was honored at the 1983 Friars Club dinner at the hotel.Brooke Shields has stated that her very first encounter with the paparazzi was in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf at the age of 12, stating that she stood like a statue wondering why they were all hired to photograph me , and that she debuted at the Waldorf . During her childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, Paris Hilton lived with her family in the hotel. One of the most prestigious debutante balls in the world is the invitation only International Debutante Ball held biennially in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. Since 1954 the musical entertainment at the ball has traditionally been provided by the musicians of the Lester Lanin Orchestra.  In popular culture The Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. Ginger Rogers headlined an all star ensemble cast in the 1945 film Week End at the Waldorf, set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there. Other films shot at the hotel include The Out of Towners , Broadway Danny Rose , Coming to America , Scent of a Woman , The Cowboy Way , Random Hearts , Analyze This , For Love of the Game , Serendipity , The Royal Tenenbaums , Maid in Manhattan , Two Weeks Notice , Catch Me If You Can , End of the Century , Mr. and Mrs. Smith , The Pink Panther , and The Hoax . Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include Law and Order, Rescue Me, Sex and the City, The Sopranos and Will and Grace.Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including Edward Hungerford's Story of the Waldorf and Horace Sutton's Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf Astoria .Langston Hughes wrote a poem entitled Advertisement for the Waldorf Astoria , criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel. Wallace Stevens wrote a poem entitled Arrival at the Waldorf , in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of Guatemala to being back at the Waldorf . In Meg Cabot's novel Jinx, the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf Astoria. It is at this point that Tory reveals Jean's first attempt at a love spell, which catalyzed the novel's events.Waldorf of the Muppets series was named after the hotel. In the episode starring Dizzy Gillespie his heckling partner Statler couldn't make it due to illness so Waldorf's wife Astoria came with him. Ayn Rand biographer Anne Heller wrote that the Waldorf Astoria inspired the Wayne Falkland Hotel in Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.

            "text": "Bryant Park is a 9.6 acre public park located in the New York City borough of Manhattan. Privately managed, it is located between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas and between 40th and 42nd Streets in Midtown Manhattan. The eastern half of Bryant Park is occupied by the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. The western half, which contains a lawn, shaded walkways, and amenities such as a carousel, is located entirely over an underground structure that houses the library's stacks. The park hosts several events, including a seasonal Winter Village with an ice rink and shops during the winter. The first park at the site was opened in 1847 and was called Reservoir Square due to its proximity to the Croton Distributing Reservoir. Reservoir Square contained the New York Crystal Palace, which hosted the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in 1853 and burned down in 1858. The square was renamed in 1884 for abolitionist and journalist William Cullen Bryant. The reservoir was demolished in 1900 and the New York Public Library's main branch was built on the site, opening in 1911. Bryant Park was rebuilt in 1933 1934 to a plan by Lusby Simpson. After a period of decline, it was restored in 1988 1992 by architecture firms Hanna Olin Ltd. and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, during which the park was rebuilt and the library's stacks were built underneath. Further improvements were made in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Though it is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Bryant Park is managed by the private not for profit organization Bryant Park Corporation, which was founded in 1980 and led the restoration of Bryant Park. The park is cited as a model for the success of public private partnerships. The park is both a National Register of Historic Places listing and a New York City designated landmark.  History   Early history  In 1686, when the area was still a wilderness, New York's colonial governor, Thomas Dongan, designated the area now known as Bryant Park as a public space. George Washington's troops crossed the area while retreating from the Battle of Long Island in 1776. The road upon which Washington's troops retreated traversed the park site diagonally. The city acquired the land in 1822. Beginning in 1823, Bryant Park was designated a potter's field and remained so until 1840, when thousands of bodies were moved to Wards Island.The first park at this site opened in 1847, though that park was never legally named. It was called Reservoir Square after the Croton Distributing Reservoir, which was erected on the eastern side of the park site due to its elevated location. In 1853, the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations with the New York Crystal Palace, featuring thousands of exhibitors, took place in the park. The Crystal Palace, also known as the Great Exhibition Hall, burned down in 1858. The Latting Observatory was also constructed in the park as part of the 1853 Exhibition, and was also burned down in 1856. The square was used for military drills during the American Civil War, and was the site of some of the New York City draft riots of July 1863, when the Colored Orphan Asylum at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street was burned down.Reservoir Square was renovated in 1870 1871, during which the modern day park had been laid out. Several additional structures were planned for Reservoir Square, but never built. These included an 1870 plan for new armory for the 7th New York Militia, an 1880 plan for an opera house, another plan in 1881 for a New York Historical Society building, an 1893 plan for relocating the New York City Hall building, and a 1903 plan for a general post office.  Late 19th and early 20th centuries   Renaming and library construction  In 1884, Reservoir Square was renamed Bryant Park, to honor the New York Evening Post editor and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant. Around the same time as the park's renaming, in 1883, plans emerged to build a library in Bryant Park, atop the site of the reservoir. The library would be funded by Samuel J. Tilden. This was opposed somewhat by property owners, who wanted to extend the park eastward onto the reservoir site. Nevertheless, by the 1890s, the reservoir was slated for demolition. When the New York Public Library was founded in 1895, its founders wanted an imposing main branch building.: 2 The trustees of the libraries chose to build the branch at the eastern end of Bryant Park, along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets, because it was centrally located between the Astor and Lenox Libraries, the library's direct predecessors. The architects of the building, Carr re and Hastings, also planned to convert the western border along Sixth Avenue into a pedestrian arcade with a flower market, while the central portion of Bryant Park would have housed sculptures and statues. However, these plans were cancelled as a result of opposition.The reservoir was torn down by 1900, and construction started on the library. In conjunction with the library's construction, several improvements were made to the park, such as terrace gardens, public facilities, and kiosks, as well as a raised terrace adjoining the library on the eastern portion of the park.: 1 Since Bryant Park itself was located several feet above the surrounding streets, an iron fence, hedge, and embankment wall were built on the north, west, and south borders to separate the park from the bordering sidewalks. Benches were also installed along the retaining walls. Bryant Park's interior was split into three lawns, divided by a pair of west east gravel paths that aligned roughly with the sidewalks of 41st Street on the west end of the park. Four stone stairways were built: one each from Sixth Avenue's intersections with 40th and 42nd Streets, and one each from 40th and 42nd Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. In addition, 42nd Street was widened in 1910, necessitating the relocation of the fence on Bryant Park's northern border and the removal of plants there. The NYPL's Main Branch was opened on May 23, 1911.  Infrastructure and further improvements  Due to its central location in Midtown Manhattan, several transit lines and infrastructure projects were also built around Bryant Park. The first of these was the Sixth Avenue Elevated railway, which opened in 1878. The city's first subway line, now part of the 42nd Street Shuttle, was opened in 1904 by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and ran directly under 42nd Street. In the 1910s, the Hudson Manhattan Railroad also planned to extend their Uptown Hudson Tubes from Herald Square to Grand Central Terminal, with intermediate stations near Bryant Park's northeast and southwest corners, though this plan was never realized.The Catskill Aqueduct water tunnel was built under Bryant Park in the early 1910s. Once the work was complete, the affected sections of Bryant Park were restored. During World War I, Bryant Park was frequently used for patriotic rallies, and a war garden and a recreation building for Allied soldiers was erected in the park. After the end of the war in 1920, an experimental garden was placed in the park and the recreation building was destroyed. During construction of the IRT Flushing Line in the 1920s, the northern segment of Bryant Park was partly closed for four years while the subway line was constructed directly underneath. The subway tunnel ran 35 feet below ground level with a station at the eastern edge of the park, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. During construction, workers took precautions to avoid interrupting the flow of traffic above ground and interfering with preexisting tunnels. The Fifth Avenue station opened in 1926, while the tunnel under Bryant Park to Times Square opened the following year. In January 1927, after the section of the Flushing Line under Bryant Park was complete, plans were announced for a restoration of the park's northern section.  1930s restoration  By the 1930s, Bryant Park was suffering from neglect and was considered disreputable, as the Sixth Avenue elevated literally overshadowed the park.: 236 Over a period of 10 years, about 100 separate plans for Bryant Park's renovation were proposed, but never enacted. In an attempt to revitalize the park, the George Washington Bicentennial Planning Committee and Sears filed plans for a replica of lower Manhattan's Federal Hall in early 1932. During the construction of the replica, part of the park was fenced off. The Dr. Marion Sims and Washington Irving statues were removed; the statues were later found under the Williamsburg Bridge. The replica was opened to the public in May 1932, charging an admission fee for entry. That November, Manhattan parks commissioner Walter R. Herrick formally notified Sears that the replica had to be torn down, because he did not approve of its proposed conversion into a Great Depression relief center. By the next year, the Bicentennial Committee's funds had been exhausted. The replica was torn down in mid 1933.In an attempt to engage unemployed architects, the Architects' Emergency Committee held a competition for the redesign of Bryant Park in 1933. The winning design was submitted by Lusby Simpson, of Queens.: 2 : 236 However, due to a lack of funding, the winning design was not implemented immediately. In February 1934, under the leadership of newly appointed parks commissioner Robert Moses, work was started on Simpson's plan. The renovated park featured a great lawn, as well as hedges and later an iron fence that separated the park from the surrounding city streets. Two entrances each were added from 40th and 42nd Streets.: 2 As part of the project, 270 trees were placed around the park. Moses also placed the park's statues along 40th and 42nd Streets so as to block sight lines from these streets. To save money, the project hired workers from the Civil Works Administration, an unemployment relief program. The renovation was complete by late 1934, and after a short postponement, the park reopened that September 15.: 2 Parts of the park were closed in the late 1930s due to transit changes on Sixth Avenue; the elevated was torn down in 1938, and the construction of the underground Sixth Avenue subway line occurred around the same time. The Sixth Avenue subway opened in 1940. A New Yorker article remarked in 1936 that during the prior 14 years, Bryant Park has been closed to the public ... for half that time.  Mid 20th century  Public events in Bryant Park were held through the mid 20th century. For instance, in 1944 during World War II, an aircraft demonstration was held in the park. Outdoor summer concerts in Bryant Park were started in 1948 by Philip Lieson Miller, a musicologist at the New York Public Library. These concerts took place from 12 to 2 pm on weekdays from July through September. On October 15, 1969, forty thousand people attended a rally in Bryant Park as part of the nationwide Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam. Another large event, the Big Apple Circus, was proposed to be held in Bryant Park in 1978, but parks commissioner Gordon Davis denied the circus permission to host a show there, since it would have closed off Bryant Park to the public.Plans to build parking garages under Bryant Park also surfaced in the mid 20th century, as a means of relieving parking shortages in Midtown Manhattan. The first such plan was made in 1946 when the city conducted a survey to determine the feasibility of such a garage. Parks commissioner Moses opposed the plan. A parking garage was proposed again in 1958, with plans for 1,200 spaces, though Moses also opposed this proposal. This proposal was backed by the Avenue of the Americas Association. However, though Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. supported the proposal, the New York City Planning Commission voted against it in November 1961.By the 1960s, Bryant Park had entered a state of deterioration, due to a lack of maintenance and its location in a business district with few nighttime activities. In an attempt to deter crime, new lighting was installed in Bryant Park in 1962. Nevertheless, in 1966, parks commissioner Thomas Hoving called a meeting to restore the park, noting its degraded condition. By the 1970s, Bryant Park had been taken over by drug dealers and the homeless, and was considered a no go area by ordinary citizens and visitors. The condition of the park was so bad that in 1973, parks commissioner Richard M. Clurman threatened to close Bryant Park and clear it of everybody until we can get together and make it a place that New Yorkers want it to be. After a man was murdered at the park in 1976, the New York Times noted that gambling and drinking were commonplace at the park. In an opinion piece in the New York Daily News, Jerome Gartner, a coordinator for the Bryant Park Steering Committee, stated that the mugging of a Union Carbide executive in Bryant Park had been quoted as a reason for the company's moving out of New York City.An initial attempt at cleanup was commenced by the Bryant Park Community Fund in the mid 1970s. Free concerts were added in the hope that it would keep out criminals. The initiative was largely unsuccessful, though, and its funding was nearly depleted by 1977. Another initiative, the Bryant Park Steering Committee, was created in 1977 as a partnership between local businesses and the City University of New York. More New York City Police Department officers were added, and District Attorney Robert Morgenthau agreed to process arrests in Bryant Park more quickly. By 1978, public perception of Bryant Park's safety was slightly better than in previous years, though drug dealers still frequented the park after office workers had gone back to work following their lunch breaks. Furthermore, NYPD officers initially declined to arrest drug users who were nonviolent. Starting in 1979, a coordinated program of amenities, including book and flower markets, landscape improvements, and entertainment activities, was initiated by a parks advocacy group called the Parks Council. Though the Parks Council's activities became popular, drug use and small crimes were still common within the park through the early 1980s. After a group of undercover NYPD officers were stationed in the park starting in 1980, they had made 400 drug related arrests within six months.  Late 20th century to present   Formation of corporations  The Bryant Park Restoration Corporation was founded in 1980 by Dan Biederman, along with Andrew Heiskell, chairman of Time Inc. and the New York Public Library. The BPRC immediately brought significant changes to remake the park into a place that people wanted to visit, and instituted a rigorous program to clean the park, remove graffiti, and repair physical damage. The BPRC also created a private security staff to confront unlawful behavior. In addition, the BPRC started an outdoor concert series in the summers. By 1982, arrests had decreased significantly compared to two years prior.Another agency the Bryant Park Management Corporation, composed of several nearby businesses was tasked with maintaining the park, spending 525,000 per year to do so. NYC Parks spent an additional 250,000 a year on maintenance, the same amount as when the city had sole control over the park's management. In 1983, HBO's president, Frank Biondi, gave Heiskell a 100,000 check just before the company moved into new headquarters at 1100 Avenue of the Americas, adjacent to the park. At the time, that was the largest donation toward Bryant Park by a private corporation.  Renovation  In 1983, in an attempt to draw crowds to the park and raise money for continued maintenance, the BPRC proposed leasing Bryant Park from the city, renovating it, and building a caf in the park. The 18 million renovation was to be executed by an alliance between the BPRC, NYPL, and NYC Parks. Restaurateur Warner LeRoy was to operate the eatery, and he planned to build an 80 foot tall , 10,500 square foot glass caf on the park's east side adjacent to the library. In addition, the park would include four smaller food kiosks, a reflecting pool and water fountain, and a dedicated security team. In 1984, the state passed legislation to allow the BPRC to lease space for such an eatery. The City Planning Commission also approved the structure the following year. However, the proposed caf was met with opposition from the public, as it would obscure the library's rear facade. Several park advocates who opposed it argued that the proposed eatery would turn over part of a public park to a private entity. LeRoy withdrew from the project in 1986 due to this opposition, saying that he feared that the constant reviews of the plan would bring the proposed structure to mediocrity .The renovation was approved by the City Art Commission in January 1987, though the restaurant plan had not yet been approved. Following LeRoy's withdrawal from the proposed Bryant Park caf , the BPRC created a new plan with multiple smaller restaurant spaces. The spaces would be composed of two smaller pavilions, each 20 feet tall with an area of 5,250 square feet , flanking the Bryant memorial next to the library. In September 1987, the plans went to another vote before the City Art Commission, with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission taking an advisory role. The redesigned restaurant spaces were also approved by the City Art Commission that December, though the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission registered no official position on the matter. A concessionaire for one of the spaces was found in 1988, and the same year, the city turned over duties of Bryant Park's land to BPRC. Subsequently, the park redesign was drafted by Hanna Olin Ltd. and Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates; the design preserved many elements of Simpson's design in the 1930s.: 236 The park was closed for renovations on July 11, 1988. The four year project to rebuild Bryant Park entailed new entrances, repairs to paths and lighting,: 237 238 and a redesign of the park's garden by Lynden Miller. Biederman worked with William H. Whyte, a sociologist whose influence led them to implement two decisions.: 237 238 One was the placement of 2,000 movable chairs in the park. The other was to lower the park itself, because Bryant Park had been elevated from the street and isolated by tall hedges prior to the 1988 redesign.: 237 238 The 1988 renovation lowered the park to nearly street level and tore out the hedges, though much of the park was still slightly elevated. The park's restrooms, which had been closed for 35 years, were renovated, as well. The BPRC also found that several of the sculptures would need to be repaired, and called on William Cullen Bryant's descendants and other entities to provide funding for the restoration of these sculptures. Landscape architect Laurie Olin of Hanna Olin recalls that the design process focused on the different abilities of people who use these spaces...as well as making spaces that people are comfortable being with each other in. The restoration cost 8.9 million, which included 5.7 million of city funding and 3.2 million of private funding.The renovation took place at the same time as the NYPL's expansion of the main branch's stacks underneath Bryant Park. The project was originally estimated to cost 21.6 million and was to be the largest expansion project in the main branch's history; it entailed building 84 miles of stacks, which could hold 3.2 million books. Construction on the stacks started after the park was closed. The park was excavated and the Great Lawn was rebuilt above it. Once the underground facilities were completed, Bryant Park was completely rebuilt, with 2.5 to 6 feet of earth between the park surface and the storage facility's ceiling.  Reopening and critical acclaim  Bryant Park was initially supposed to reopen in late 1990 or early 1991. The reopening date was pushed back due to delays caused by the construction of the library's stacks. In June 1991, the city and BPRC reached an agreement to reopen the western section of Bryant Park on summer weekdays. The park was soft reopened on April 21, 1992, with the official reopening set for nearly a month later.The new design received widespread acclaim. Deemed a triumph for many by New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger, the renovation was lauded not only for its architectural excellence, but also for adhering to Whyte's vision. According to Goldberger, Biederman understood that the problem of Bryant Park was its perception as an enclosure cut off from the city; he knew that, paradoxically, people feel safer when not cut off from the city, and that they feel safer in the kind of public space they think they have some control over. The renovation was lauded as The Best Example of Urban Renewal by New York magazine, and was described by Time as a small miracle .: 34 Many awards followed, including a Design Merit Award from Landscape Architecture Magazine,: 34 and the 1996 Award for Excellence from the Urban Land Institute . The park has been extolled for its relative calmness and cleanness. Even through the 21st century, Bryant Park remains a model of civic renewal that mayors of other cities, such as Jorge Elorza of Providence, Rhode Island, sometimes hold up as a model to emulate.Bryant Park was described in the media as an example of New York City's 1990s revival. A New York Times article in 1995 referred to the park as the Town Square of Midtown and an office oasis frequented by midtown office workers. Further improvements included the installation of two newsstands in 1992, one each at Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Open air concerts in the summers, which drew thousands of people, were commenced. To lessen infestations of pigeons eating the plants, the BPC started scattering corn kernels that contained the drug azacosterol, which resulted in many pigeons becoming infertile without any other side effects. Meanwhile, financing for a restaurant in Bryant Park next to the library was finally secured in 1993. The restaurant opened in 1995.  Subsequent developments  With security largely under the purview of the BPC, corporate control of the park has meant that Bryant Park received passive recreation amenities, while excluding active sports that might cater to a broader urban public. The BPC added a custom built carousel in 2002 and revived the tradition of an open air library, the Reading Room, in 2003. In July 2002, the park launched a public wireless network, making the park the first in New York City to formally offer free Wi Fi access to visitors. The Wi Fi system was subsequently upgraded in 2008. Furthermore, the Pond, a free admission ice skating rink, opened in the park in 2005. The park's public restrooms were renovated in 2006 and in 2017.The dramatic rise in real estate values in the area around Bryant Park, as well as new construction in adjacent areas, was a consequence of the park's improvements. By 1993, the surrounding region had become a highly desirable office area, and formerly vacant office space around the park was being filled quickly. By the first decade of the 21st century, nearby buildings and businesses were also using names that referred to the park. This was shown by the then new Bank of America Tower skyscraper at the park's northeast corner using the address One Bryant Park , as well as the growing trend of Bryant Park vanity addresses, including 3, 4, 5, and 7 Bryant Park. National Public Radio, located just south of the park, also named a now defunct talk show the Bryant Park Project upon the show's 2007 launch. Such enthusiasm to use the Bryant Park name would have been nonexistent in the 1980s, when the area was described as the Wild West .New real estate developments were also built in the park's vicinity starting in the 21st century, which together added over 13,000 new workers to the area immediately surrounding Bryant Park. These included the Bank of America Tower; an expansion to 1095 Avenue of the Americas immediately to the south; Eleven Times Square a block west of Bryant Park; and 505 Fifth Avenue at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Several hotels were also built, including a conversion of 485 Fifth Avenue at 41st Street, a Residence Inn by Marriott at Sixth Avenue and 39th Street. By the early 2010s, investors were purchasing buildings around Bryant Park south of 42nd Street as part of a small real estate boom. Rents per square foot in buildings south of 42nd Street had historically been lower than rents in buildings north of 42nd Street. Conversely, 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 452 Fifth Avenue were able to attract comparatively high rental rates despite both being south of 42nd Street. Later in the decade, the area around Bryant Park started growing into a residential neighborhood, with the construction of new developments in the area. Within a two block radius of the park, or roughly 500 feet , units routinely sold for millions of dollars.  Description Bryant Park is located between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 40th and 42nd Street, and covers 9.6 acres . Although technically the main branch of the New York Public Library is located within the park, in design it forms the eastern boundary of the park's green space, making Sixth Avenue the park's primary entrance. Bryant Park is used mostly as a passive recreation space, and lacks active sports facilities. Bryant Park is several steps above the surrounding streets, enclosed by a retaining wall. Granite stairs at several locations provide access from the surrounding sidewalks.: 2 The surrounding area contains numerous structures, including the Bank of America Tower and 1095 Avenue of the Americas to the northwest;: 270 271 the Bryant Park Studios, American Radiator Building, Engineers' Club Building, and 452 Fifth Avenue to the south;: 268 270 461 Fifth Avenue and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library to the southeast;: 269 and 500 Fifth Avenue, the Aeolian Building, and the W.R. Grace Building to the north.: 271 One of the park's largest features is a large lawn located slightly below the level of the surrounding walkways.: 2 Besides serving as a lunchroom for office workers, the lawn serves as the seating area for some of the park's major events, such as Bryant Park Movie Nights, Broadway in Bryant Park, and Square Dance. The lawn's season runs from February until October, when it is closed to make way for Bank of America Winter Village.Numerous walkways surround the central lawn. The northern and southern sides are each flanked by two flagstone walkways. Each of these walkways is bordered by London plane trees , which contribute to the park's European feel. In addition, numerous statues are scattered throughout the park.: 2 A raised terrace on the eastern side of the lawn, which dates to the construction of the library's main branch, is paved with gray flagstones and red brick. Its centerpiece is the William Cullen Bryant Memorial, which is raised on a pedestal of its own.: 4 A restroom structure is located at the northern border of the park along 42nd Street. A carousel, installed in 2002, is located at the park's southern border. The park is served by the New York City Subway's 7, 7 , B, D, F, F , and M trains at 42nd Street Bryant Park Fifth Avenue station, entrances to which are located on the northern and western borders of the park, as well as MTA Regional Bus Operations' M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M7, M42, M55 and Q32 routes.  Art and monuments   Sculptures  Notable sculptures in the park include or have included: Statue of William E. Dodge , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's northern border Statue of J. Marion Sims , removed in the 1930s Washington Irving , removed in the 1930s William Cullen Bryant Memorial , a standing figure located on a canopied pedestal at the park's eastern border Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain , located at the park's western border; the fountain collects about 3,000 to 4,000 in coins each year, from dozens of countries Bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , a bust located at the park's southern border Statue of Jos Bonif cio de Andrada , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's southwestern corner Statue of Gertrude Stein , a sitting figure located at the park's southeastern corner Statue of Benito Ju rez , a standing figure located on a pedestal at the park's northwestern corner  Other memorials  The northwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, contains the Heiskell Plaza, a stairway and entrance plaza paved with flagstones. It was placed in 1993 in honor of Andrew Heiskell, a cofounder of the BPC.The southwest corner of Bryant Park, at Sixth Avenue and 40th Street, is known as Nikola Tesla Corner. Tesla, an inventor, lived in the nearby New Yorker Hotel in his later years, and would feed pigeons in the park. The placement of the sign was due to the efforts of the Croatian Club of New York in cooperation with New York City officials, and Dr. Ljubo Vujovic of the Tesla Memorial Society of New York.  Carousel  Bryant Park contains a carousel called Le Carrousel Magique, located in the southern section of the park. The carousel was designed by Marvin Sylvor, created by the Fabricon Carousel Company, and installed in 2002. The company was selected after a carousel installation in Bryant Park was approved in 1997. The carousel has a diameter of 22 feet , weighs 12,000 pounds , and contains 14 animal casts, of which 12 are capable of moving vertically. In keeping with the French theme of the park, it plays French music. It underwent a restoration in 2009. The carousel also has a ticket booth, measuring 7 feet tall and 4 feet wide, which was constructed in 1928 and was relocated from Paragon Park in Hull, Massachusetts.  Restrooms  Bryant Park contains a Beaux Arts granite restroom structure on the northern border, along 42nd Street. There are two facilities, one for men and women, both of which are 315 square feet . These were built in 1911 along with the NYPL Main Branch, but due to the park's landmark status, they cannot be expanded. The exterior of each building contains a frieze with garland motifs.: 5 After being closed in the mid 1960s, they were restored by Kupiec Koutsomitis and reopened in 1992. The restrooms have been described as being among the city's best. A subsequent renovation in 2006 solidified their status as, in the words of then New York City Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe, the gold standard for park comfort stations. The restrooms were renovated again in 2017. Following the 2017 renovation, the restrooms contained rotating artworks selected from a collection of 225 works, as well as fresh flowers, classical music, attendants, and automatic toilets and faucets.  Reading room  The original Reading Room was founded in August 1935 to entertain unemployed workers during the Great Depression. Started as an initiative by the New York Public Library, the Reading Room provided the jobless with a place to interact and share ideas without having to pay money or show identification. Despite this, the library was well used, being used by 50,000 people by its first anniversary. Theft was low, with only 34 publications being lost in the library's first year. By its third year, 400 books and 1,000 magazines were in circulation and were being perused by 70,000 people per year. Books from the NYPL, and donations of magazines and trade publications from publishers, contributed to the success of the open air library. The tradition of Reading Rooms halted in 1944 due to a staff shortage during World War II.The Reading Room tradition was revived in 2003 with HSBC as its first sponsor. Oxford University Press, Scholastic Corporation, Mitchell's NY, Cond Nast Publications, Time Inc., Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., and Rodale, Inc. were among the companies who donated books and publications. In addition to the complimentary reading materials, in 2004 programming was added to Reading Room's content. The Reading Room features readings and book sales by contemporary writers and poets, plus book related special events such as book clubs, writers workshops and storytelling for kids.  Bank of America Winter Village  Modeled on Europe's Christkindlmarkt, in 2002 Bryant Park introduced the Holiday Shops in an effort to liven up the park space during the winter. Initially slow to gain traction, the Holiday Shops became a fixture of the Manhattan holiday scene in 2005 by expanding into an all encompassing seasonal destination with the addition of New York's only free admission ice skating rink. The Shops also include a Norway Spruce tree, as well as a standalone dining and event space.Sponsored by Bank of America, Winter Village can be set up within two weeks. It has transformed the park into a year round destination. In September 2016, Bryant Park Corporation announced market makers Urbanspace as the new operator for the Holiday Shops, which grew from 80 boutiques in 2002 to over 170 in 2018. In 2018, Urbanspace also took over management of the rinkside eatery, rebranding it as The Lodge.  Private operation  The Bryant Park Corporation , formerly the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation , manages the park. BPC also oversees the Bryant Park Management Corporation , which was created to manage the Bryant Park business improvement district.Although Bryant Park is a public park, BPC accepts no public funds. It was initially supported by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but now receives funding through tax assessments on surrounding property within the business improvement district, fees from concessionaires, and revenues generated by public events. To acquire accurate data about park usage, BPC counts the number of patrons in Bryant Park twice per day, at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. The number of events at the park grew significantly after its reopening, causing some consternation by people who feared that the park would be dominated by private entities, thus would be inaccessible to the public. As a result, BPC makes most events free and open to the public. One exception was the New York Fashion Week shows that formerly took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. BPC cofounder Dan Biederman often publicly expressed his frustration that the fashion shows were not under BPC's control. They pay us a million dollars. It's a million dollars I would happily do without, he told the Los Angeles Times. BPC was particularly frustrated that the fashion shows dominated the park during two crucial times: in late summer, when the weather is perfect for park visitors; and in early February, necessitating the early closure of the park's popular free admission ice skating rink.  Programming Numerous events are hosted on the lawn at Bryant Park. Bryant Park Movie Nights, begun in the early 1990s, take place on Monday evenings during the summer. Various free musical performances are sponsored by corporations during months with warm weather, including Broadway in Bryant Park, sponsored by iHeartMedia and featuring performers from current Broadway musicals, integrated with content provided by event sponsors.The park has various activity areas open all day long, including board games, chess and backgammon, a putting green and Kubb area, an Art Cart, ping pong tables, and Petanque courts. The parks also offer free classes in juggling, yoga, tai chi, and knitting. In the 40th Street plaza of the park, there is a station called Bryant Park Games where visitors can borrow an array of games, including Chinese chess and quoits. In addition, chess and table tennis can also be played at Bryant Park.Food and drink are served at four park operated concessionary kiosks. There are two additional kiosks on Fifth Avenue, bringing the total of concessionaires near Bryant Park to six.  Former programming  Formerly, Bryant Park hosted New York Fashion Week shows, which took over the park for two weeks in the winter and late summer each year. NYFW, which moved to Bryant Park in 1993, was forced to set fees for its shows after Manhattan Community Board 5 disapproved of a free fashion show on the grounds that three fourths of profits would go to BPC and only one fourth to NYC Parks. Dan Biederman of the BPC had called the profits from NYFW a million dollars I would happily do without, and lamented the fact that NYFW took over the park at two high traffic periods: late summer and late winter. NYFW moved from Bryant Park in 2010 after disagreements with the BPC.  Landmark designations Bryant Park and the New York Public Library Main Branch were jointly listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Its listing on the NRHP is distinct from the New York Public Library on the same day, which covered just the main branch building. In addition, in 1974, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the park as an official scenic landmark.

Together with the Lorentz force law, these equations form the foundation for classical electrodynamics and classical optics as well as electric circuits. 1874: Ferdinand Braun discovers the rectifier effect in metal sulfides and metal oxides. 1877: Thomas Edison invents the first phonograph, using a tin foil cylinder. For the first time sounds could be recorded and played. A phonograph horn with membrane and needle was arranged in such a way that the needle had contact to the tinfoil. 1880: the American physicist Charles Sumner Tainter discovers that many disadvantages of Edison's cylinders can be eliminated if the soundtrack is arranged in spiral form and engraved in a flat, round disk. Technical problems soon ended these experiments. Still, Tainter is regarded as the inventor of the gramophone record. 1884: Paul Nipkow obtains a patent for his Nipkow disk, an image scanning device that reads images serially, which constitutes the foundation for mechanical television. Two years later his patent runs out. 1886: Heinrich Hertz succeeds in proving the existence of electromagnetic waves for the first time now the groundwork for wireless telegraphy and radio broadcasting in physical science is laid. 1887: Unaware of Charles Sumner Tainter's experiments, German American Emil Berliner has his phonograph patented. He used a disk instead of a cylinder, primarily to avoid infringing on Edison's patent. Quickly it becomes obvious that flat Gramophone records are easier to duplicate and store. 1888: Alexander Graham Bell significantly reduces interfering noises by using a wax cylinder instead of tin foil. This paves the way to commercial success for the improved phonograph. American Oberlin Smith describes a process to record audio using a cotton thread with integrated fine wire clippings. This makes reel to reel audio tape recording possible. 1890: The phonograph becomes faster and more convenient due to an electric motor. The electric motor brings on the first juke box with cylinders even before flat disk records were widely available. Thomas Edison discovers thermionic emission. This effect forms the basis for the vacuum tube and the cathode ray tube. approximately 1893: The invention of the selenium phototube allows the conversion of brightness values into electrical signals. The principle is applied in wirephoto and television technology for a short time. Selenium is used in light meters for the next 50 years. 1895: Auguste Lumiere's cinematograph displays moving images for the first time. In the same year, brothers Emil and Max Skladanowsky present their Bioscop in Berlin. 1897 Ferdinand Braun invents the inertialess cathode ray oscillograph tube , a principle which remained unchanged in television picture tubes. The Italian Guglielmo Marconi transmits wireless telegraph messages by electromagnetic waves over a distance of five kilometers. 1898 The Danish physicist Valdemar Poulsen creates the world's first magnetic recording and reproduction, using a 1 mm thick steel wire as a magnetizable carrier. Nikola Tesla publicly demonstrated the first wireless remote control of a model ship. 1899: The dog Nipper is used in His Master's Voice , the trademark for gramophones and records. 1901 The Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo began the development of a system, which he called Telekine, who consisted of a robot that executed commands transmitted by electromagnetic waves. The system was a way of testing dirigible balloons of his own creation without risking human lives. Unlike previous radio controls which carried out actions of the 'on off' type, Torres defined a method for controlling any mechanical or electrical device with different states of operation. The machine could send up to 19 different orders and it was able to memorize the signals received to carry out operations on its own. In 1906, in the presence of the King of Spain and before a great crowd, Torres successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding a boat from the shore with people on board. With the Telekine, Torres Quevedo laid down modern wireless remote control operation principles. 1902 Otto von Bronk patented his Method and apparatus for remote visualization of images and objects with temporary resolution of the images in parallel rows of dots . This patent, originally developed for phototelegraphy, impacted the development of color television, particularly the NTSC implementation. For the first time audio records are printed with paper labels in the middle. 1903: Guglielmo Marconi provides evidence that wireless telegraphic communication is possible over long distances, such as across the Atlantic. He used a transmitter developed by Ferdinand Braun. 1904 For the first time, double sided records, and those with a diameter of 30 cm are produced, increasing playing time up to 11 minutes . These are created by Odeon in Berlin and debuted at the Leipzig Spring Fair. The German physicist Arthur Korn developed the first practical method for telegraphy. 1905: The Englishman Sir John Ambrose Fleming invents the first electron tube. 1906 Robert von Lieben patented his inertia working cathode ray relays . By 1910 he developed this into the first real tube amplifier, by creating a triode. His invention of the triode is almost simultaneously created by the American Lee de Forest. Max Dieckmann and Gustav Glage use the Braun tube for playback of 20 line black and white images. The first jukebox with records comes on the market.

It also created the first radio phonograph combinations, the precursor to the 1960s music chests. The German physicist Curt Stille records magnetic sound for film, on a perforated steel band. First, this Magnettonverfahren has no success. Years later it is rediscovered for amateur films, providing easy dubbing. A Daylygraph or Magnettonger t had amplifier and equalizer, and a mature Magnettondiktierger t called Textophon . Based on patents, which he had purchased of silence, brings the Englishman E. Blattner the Blattnerphone the first magnetic sound recording on the market. It records on a thin steel band. The first sound film using optical sound premiers.

First regular television broadcasts in Japan. 1955 The second generation TRADIC , first to use only transistors therefore much smaller and more powerful than its predecessor tube computers. The Briton Narinder Singh Kapany investigated the propagation of light in fine glass fibers . The first wireless remote control for a television US based Zenith consists of a better flashlight, with which one lights up in one of the four devices corners to turn the unit on or off, change the channel or mute the sound. 1956 The company Metz introduces radio device type 409 3D. First mass production of printed circuit boards. This follows since the 1930s, several improvements to the manufacturing technology. The company Ampex introduces the VR 1000 the first video recorder. That same year, CBS uses it for the first magnetic video tape recording from. Although other programs are produced in color since 1954, the VTR cannot record color. 1957: The Frenchman Henri de France developed the first generation of color TV system SECAM, which avoids some of the problems of the NTSC method. The weaknesses of the SECAM system be fixed in later modifications of the standard for the most part. 1958 By merging the Edison patents and the Berliner, the Blumlein stereo recording method becomes commercially viable. The company Mercury Records launches the first stereo record on the market. The company Ampex expands the video recorder with the Model VR 1000 B to give it color capability.

            "text": "Nikola Corporation is an American manufacturer of heavy duty commercial battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, and energy solutions. It presented several vehicle concepts from 2016 to 2020, the first of which was a natural gas fuelled turbine electric semi truck. The company went public on June 4, 2020. In February 2022, the company projected deliveries of between 300 and 500 of its first battery electric semitrucks known as the Nikola Tre to customers. The company delivered its first two battery electric trucks in December 2021.In September 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice launched investigations into securities fraud allegations. In July 2021, a United States federal grand jury indicted Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton, but did not indict the company. The indictment charged Milton with three counts of criminal fraud for lying about 'nearly all aspects of the business' and two counts of securities fraud. Publicly traded shares in Nikola dropped to around US 12 after falling from over 65 in mid 2020, when its market valuation had exceeded that of the Ford Motor Company.Like the much larger Tesla, Inc., the company is named in honor of Nikola Tesla, but is not related to the inventor. Nikola Corporation is based in Phoenix, Arizona.  History   Founding  Nikola Corporation was founded by Trevor Milton in 2014 in Salt Lake City, Utah.As of 2016, the first 5,000 Nikola One hydrogen powered glider trucks were slated to be built by Fitzgerald Glider Kits in Tennessee . In March 2019, Nikola acquired a 389 acre parcel of land in Coolidge, Arizona, for 23 million, with future state and local tax breaks. Nikola said in 2019 that they expected truck factory construction to start in 2020, truck construction in 2021, and the fabrication of 35 50,000 trucks per year by 2023.In February 2019, Mark Russell was hired as company president. Russell had most recently been president and CEO of Nikola Corporation's investor, Worthington Industries.In April 2019, Nikola held the Nikola World event in Scottsdale, Arizona. The two day midweek event included a public demo day to show off the Nikola Two truck, the Nikola Tre truck, the Nikola NZT UTV, and the Nikola WAV watercraft.  Going public  In March 2020, Nikola Corporation announced its plans to merge with VectoIQ Acquisition Corporation , a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company run by former General Motors vice chairman Steve Girsky. This resulted in the combined company being listed on the NASDAQ exchange with the NKLA ticker symbol. As part of the merger, founder and CEO Trevor Milton had his title changed from CEO to Executive Chairman and Nikola President Mark Russell became president and CEO. Nikola's stock began trading on June 4, 2020, a day after the merger was completed. By June 9, the shares had more than doubled since they began trading, as investors continued to bet on the growth potential of electric transportation. At the end of June, Nikola started taking reservations for pickup truck, the Badger, even though a prototype had not been shown to the public.The company was valued at around 13 billion in early August 2020, compared to its revenue in the first six months of 2020 of 80,000 .On September 8, 2020, Nikola and GM announced a partnership, by which GM would acquire an 11 stake in Nikola . GM would also earn the right to nominate one member to Nikola's board. In return, GM agreed to use its manufacturing facilities to begin production of the Badger, as well as supply fuel cells and batteries to Nikola globally. Nikola stock jumped by 50 after the announcement.  Fraud allegations and fallout  On September 10, 2020, short seller firm Hindenburg Research released a report accusing Nikola of being an intricate fraud perpetrated largely by Milton. Further verification by Financial Times and Research Enquirer confirmed the report's claim regarding a showcased Nikola One rolling down a gradual slope with no onboard propulsion and instead by using the force of gravity. The stock fell by 10 that day while the stock of GM, which had made an agreement with Nikola days earlier, fell by 4 . By September 12, Nikola stock had fallen by 36 .Nikola called these claims false and misleading and threatened legal action against Hindenburg. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York showed interest in the report. Previously, Milton had alleged that those who were short selling Nikola stocks are fans of rival company Tesla and are anti Nikola or paid attack accounts . In response to the release of the Hindenburg report, Mary Barra, CEO of GM, said her company conducted appropriate diligence before its deal with Nikola. Reports that became public on September 14 stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission had started a probe into the fraud allegations and on September 15, the Department of Justice began an investigation into Nikola as well.On September 21, 2020, Executive Chairman, founder and former CEO Trevor Milton announced his resignation from Nikola and Steve Girsky became non executive chairman of the board. News of the allegations caused the share price of Nikola Corp to drop by 20 . Following the resignation, Nikola then issued copyright takedown notices targeting critics on YouTube who citing fair use used clips of the promotional video in which a Nikola One semi truck was seen rolling down a hill without a working drivetrain. The Drive called Nikola's action an abuse of YouTube's copyright takedown system .On September 23, BP backed away from a potential partnership to develop hydrogen refueling stations for Nikola's EV Trucks; Nikola's stock price fell by more than 25 intraday after BP's statement. The partnership was cited as a critical component in Nikola's business plan for its electric vehicle trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola had planned to announce the BP partnership days after the GM partnership.In November 2020, GM announced that the proposed deal to take an equity stake in Nikola would no longer occur. A revised deal was proposed, having GM provide Nikola with the promised fuel cell technology, but leaving out the 11 stake in the company as well as no longer producing the Badger electric pickup truck for the company. The Badger was subsequently cancelled.In December 2020, Republic Services stated that their previously announced partnership with Nikola would be terminated due to the corporate restructuring at Nikola. The two companies had agreed to jointly develop zero emissions garbage trucks in August 2020, including the production of at least 2,500 to 5,000 trucks for the Republic Services fleet by the start of 2023. Nikola's shares fell 9.8 after the announcement was released. Analysts call the canceled order a short term setback, allowing the company to channel more focus towards the core of the business, being the production of semi trucks designed for long haul transport.In February 2021, the company publicly dropped their Powersports unit along with any plans they previously had to produce any of the powersports concept vehicles they had shown, including the Nikola WAV watersports vehicle. Also in February, as part of YE2020 filings with the SEC, the company stated that they now intended to produce just 50 100 Nikola Tre vehicles in 4Q2021.In June 2021, Nikola invested 50 million in a new hydrogen factory headed by Wabash Valley Resources to produce fuel for semi truck fuel stations across the Midwest.In July 2021, the company announced plans to add five new Class 8 truck dealers in Arizona, Texas, Colorado, California, New Mexico, Delaware, Florida, Maryland and Virginia.On July 29, 2021, a United States federal grand jury returned an indictment against Trevor Milton that included three counts of criminal fraud, including lying about 'nearly all aspects of the business' and two counts of securities fraud. Milton pleaded not guilty to the charges and was freed on 100 million bail, secured by two Utah properties. Nikola's share price dropped further and traded at 12 after falling from near 65 in June 2020, when Nikola had a company valuation in excess of the Ford Motor Company.Following the indictment of former CEO Trevor Milton in July 2021, the company stated We remain committed to our previously announced milestones and timelines and are focused on delivering Nikola Tre battery electric trucks later this year from the company s manufacturing facilities.  2022 present  In August 2022, Nikola announced that it would be acquiring the battery company Romeo Power. On August 4, 2022, it was reported that Nikola has delivered 48 vehicles to dealers, and reported a revenue of 18.1 million. In September 2022, all 93 of its Tre Class 8 battery electric vehicles were recalled due to an issue with seat belt anchor assembly. Nikola published October 14 that they have completed the acquisition of Romeo and look forward to executing on the opportunities ahead.  Concept vehicles Nikola has publicly announced a number of vehicle design concepts since 2016 and unveiled a few concept vehicles that the company aims to develop for public sale.  Nikola One  In 2016, the company unveiled a high level design for a natural gas fuelled Class 8 truck called the Nikola One, aimed then to be in production in 2020. The concept was changed in August 2016 to a hydrogen fuel cell powered generator instead of a natural gas fuelled gas turbine generator. In 2016 Nikola claimed to have received 2.3 Billion in pre sales, to date no deliveries have been made. In May 2018, Nikola Motor Company filed a lawsuit against Tesla, Inc. seeking 2 billion in damages alleging that the Tesla Semi infringed on six patents that Nikola has been granted on the design of the Nikola One. Tesla responded that the lawsuit is without merit. In September 2019, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board denied Tesla's request to invalidate Nikola's side door patent. As of September 2020, the lawsuit is still ongoing.In May 2018, Anheuser Busch placed a provisional purchase order for up to 800 leases of the hydrogen powered truck versions, and Nikola claimed then that the trucks would start being delivered in 2020. By 2019, total pre orders for truck leases encompassing all Nikola Class 8 truck models were claimed to be worth 14 billion.  Nikola Two  The Nikola Two is a semi tractor truck concept designed to be technically identical to the Nikola One. Unlike the Nikola One, a prototype driving under its own power was demonstrated in 2019, including when hauling a cargo of beer for a future customer.  Nikola Tre  In November 2018, the company unveiled a Nikola Tre hydrogen powered semi truck concept aimed at the European market. The hydrogen ICE Tre was also stated to be targeted for the Australian and Asian markets. Nikola said the Tre concept was to have 500 to 1,000 horsepower and a range of 310 to 750 miles . Former CEO Trevor Milton stated in 2018 that production was planned to begin at the same time as the US truck versions, which was then thought to be 2022 2023.In November 2019, the company unveiled a Nikola Tre electric truck concept that would also be aimed at the European market, just as the original hydrogen Tre had been. In July 2021, the company restated that they intend to deliver the first production Nikola Tre battery electric trucks later in 2021. The Tre was delivered to the Port of Los Angeles in December 2021. It has a 753 kWh battery pack, rechargeable from 10 to 80 in 120 minutes at 240 kW. California qualified the Tre for its HVIP program in January 2022 at up to 120,000, and New York at up to 185,000.The first customer delivery of the Nikola Tre was made in April 2022, with 11 vehicles being delivered.  Nikola NZT  In 2016, a prototype concept, the Nikola NZT was unveiled as a utility task vehicle with a 72 or 107 kWh battery. The concept was stated to have 555 horsepower total, provided by a motor at each wheel, weigh 3,500 lb , and use the same 14.5 in clearance suspension as the Ford Raptor. By the end of 2016, it was listed as a powersports product, in the Nikola Powersports division.In 2017 Nikola took a journalist for a ride along in a prototype of the car in a Utah desert to demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities. That was an open cabin version, lacking doors or a windshield. On April 16, 2019, Nikola presented an NZT in Phoenix, Arizona, that appeared similar to the original one, except it had doors . Nikola says it offered rides in this vehicle to the attendees during the event, and published a video claiming to show it. The vehicle was supposed to have 590 horsepower , and up to 150 miles of range per electric charge. The vehicle was cancelled, alongside the rest of the powersports division, in February 2021.  Nikola Reckless  The Nikola Reckless was a concept vehicle that was projected to be a military grade fully electric tactical off highway vehicle. A prototype of the vehicle was displayed in the International Special Operations Forces Industry Exhibition Conference in May 2018.The vehicle's chassis would be 4 4 although it could switch to two wheel drive. It would weigh 2,299 pounds and would be able to carry up to 1,400 pounds . Also, the vehicle would have a 0.50 inch machine gun. The vehicle was removed from the website with the cancellation of the powersports division.  Nikola WAV  The Nikola WAV was a concept vehicle unveiled in April 2019 as a Nikola Motors watersports offering and presented alongside the Nikola Zero. The Nikola WAV concept had a 12 inch waterproof 4K resolution screen, and cruise control. The vehicle was cancelled, alongside the entire powersports division, in February 2021.  Nikola Badger  The Badger was a proposed electric pickup truck announced in February 2020. Nikola planned two variants, the first powered by a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and batteries and second all electric, without fuel cells. The truck was intended to go to market in 2022 with the assistance of GM. In November 2020, GM pulled out of the deal and Nikola canceled the truck.

            "text": "Colorado Springs is a home rule municipality in, and the county seat of El Paso County, Colorado, United States. It is the largest city in El Paso County, with a population of 478,961 at the 2020 United States Census, a 15.02 increase since 2010. Colorado Springs is the second most populous city and the most extensive city in the state of Colorado, and the 40th most populous city in the United States. It is the principal city of the Colorado Springs, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and the second most prominent city of the Front Range Urban Corridor. It is located in east central Colorado, on Fountain Creek, 70 miles south of Denver. At 6,035 feet the city stands over 1 mile above sea level, though some areas are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is near the base of Pikes Peak, which rises 14,115 feet above sea level on the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains.  History  The Ute, Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples were the first recorded inhabiting the area which would become Colorado Springs. Part of the territory included in the United States' 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the current city area was designated part of the 1854 Kansas Territory. In 1859, after the first local settlement was established, it became part of the Jefferson Territory on October 24 and of El Paso County on November 28. Colorado City at the Front Range confluence of Fountain and Camp creeks was formally organized on August 13, 1859 during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. It served as the capital of the Colorado Territory from November 5, 1861, until August 14, 1862, when the capital was moved to Golden, before it was finally moved to Denver in 1867. So many immigrants from England had settled in Colorado Springs by the early 1870s that Colorado Springs was locally referred to as Little London. In 1871 the Colorado Springs Company laid out the towns of La Font and Fountain Colony, upstream and downstream respectively, of Colorado City. Within a year, Fountain Colony was renamed Colorado Springs and officially incorporated. The El Paso County seat shifted from Colorado City in 1873 to the Town of Colorado Springs. On December 1, 1880, Colorado Springs expanded northward with two annexations. The second period of annexations was during 1889 90, and included Seavey's Addition, West Colorado Springs, East End, and another North End addition. In 1891 the Broadmoor Land Company built the Broadmoor suburb, which included the Broadmoor Casino, and by December 12, 1895, the city had four Mining Exchanges and 275 mining brokers. By 1898, the city was designated into quadrants by the north south Cascade Avenue and the east west Washington Pikes Peak avenues.: 10 From 1899 to 1901 Tesla Experimental Station operated on Knob Hill, and aircraft flights to the Broadmoor's neighboring fields began in 1919. Alexander Airport north of the city opened in 1925, and in 1927 the original Colorado Springs Municipal Airport land was purchased east of the city.The city's military presence began during World War II, beginning with Camp Carson that was established in 1941. During the war, the United States Army Air Forces leased land adjacent to the municipal airfield, naming it Peterson Field in December 1942.In November 1950, Ent Air Force Base was selected as the Cold War headquarters for Air Defense Command . The former WWII Army Air Base, Peterson Field, which had been inactivated at the end of the war, was re opened in 1951 as a U.S. Air Force base. North American Aerospace Defense Command was established as a hardened command and control center within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex during the Cold War.Between 1965 and 1968, the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak State College and Colorado Technical University were established in or near the city. In 1977 most of the former Ent AFB became a US Olympic training center. The Libertarian Party was founded within the city in the 1970s.On October 1, 1981, the Broadmoor Addition, Cheyenne Canon, Ivywild, Skyway, and Stratton Meadows were annexed after the Colorado Supreme Court overturned a district court decision that voided the annexation . Further annexations expanding the city include the Nielson Addition and Vineyard Commerce Park Annexation in September 2008.  Geography  The city lies in a semi arid Steppe climate region with the Southern Rocky Mountains to the west, the Palmer Divide to the north, high plains further east, and high desert lands to the south when leaving Fountain and approaching Pueblo. Colorado Springs is 69 miles or one hour and five minutes south of Denver by car using I 25.Colorado Springs has the greatest total area of any municipality in Colorado. At the 2020 United States Census, the city had a total area of 125,287 acres including 232 acres of water.  Metropolitan area  Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area such as parks, bike trails, and open spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities experiencing tremendous growth such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budgetary issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced since 1997, and the annexation of the Banning Lewis Ranch area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.  Climate  Colorado Springs has a cooler, dry winter semi arid climate , and its location just east of the Rocky Mountains affords it the rapid warming influence from chinook winds during winter but also subjects it to drastic day to day variability in weather conditions. The city has abundant sunshine year round, averaging 243 sunny days per year, and receives approximately 16.5 inches of annual precipitation. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005 but permanently reinstated in December 2019.Colorado Springs is one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led Nikola Tesla to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.  Seasonal climate  Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging 30.8 F ; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima. Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub 0 F lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing.Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly because of direct sun, with the city receiving 38 inches per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24 hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May. Summers are warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging 70.9 F , and 18 days of 90 F highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above 70 F . Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the North American monsoon.The first autumn freeze and the last freeze in the spring, on average, occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall is October 21 through April 25. Extreme temperatures range from 101 F on June 26, 2012 and most recently on June 21, 2016, down to 27 F on February 1, 1951, and December 9, 1919.

State Highway 115 begins in Ca on City, traveling north along the western edge of Fort Carson; when it reaches the city limits it merges with Nevada Avenue, a signed Business Route of US 85. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I 25. US 85 enters the city at Fountain and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue at various points in history; however most of US 85 is concurrent with I 25 and is not signed.   County and city roads  In November 2015, voters in Colorado Springs overwhelmingly passed ballot measure 2C, dedicating funds from a temporary sales tax increase to much needed road and infrastructure improvements over five years. This temporary increase is estimated to bring in approximately 50 million annually, which will be used solely to improve roads and infrastructure. The ballot measure passed by a margin of approximately 65 35 .In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority.In early 2010, the city of Colorado Springs approved an expansion of the northernmost part of Powers Boulevard in order to create an Interstate 25 bypass commonly referred to as the Copper Ridge Expansion.  Airport  Colorado Springs Airport has been in operation since 1925. It is the second largest commercial airport in the state, after Denver International Airport . It covers 7,200 acres of land at an elevation of approximately 6,200 feet . COS is considered to be a joint use civilian and military airport, as Peterson Space Force Base is a tenant of the airport. It has three paved runways: 17L 35R is 13,501 by 150 feet , the runway 17R 35L is 11,022 by 150 feet and the runway 13 31 is 8,270 by 150 feet . The airport handled 817,000 passengers from October 2020 October 2021, and is served by American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest, and United.  Bicycling  In April 2018, the Colorado Springs City Council approved a Bike Master Plan. The vision of the city's Bike Master Plan is a healthy and vibrant Colorado Springs where bicycling is one of many transportation options for a large portion of the population, and where a well connected and well maintained network of urban trails, single track, and on street infrastructure offers a bicycling experience for present and future generations that is safe, convenient, and fun for getting around, getting in shape, or getting away. Bike lanes in Colorado Springs have not been deployed without controversy. According to The Gazette, their readers have mixed feelings for new bike lanes. In December 2016, the City removed a bike lane along Research Parkway due to overwhelming opposition; an online survey found that 80.5 of respondents opposed the bike lane. The Gazette has stated that since the Bike Master Plan was adopted by City Council, no issue has elicited more argument in The Gazette pages, and due to this immense public interest, on February 25, 2019, The Gazette hosted a town hall meeting called Battle of the Bike Lanes.  Walkability  A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Colorado Springs 34th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.  Mountain Metropolitan Transit  Mountain Metropolitan Transit is testing Battery Electric Buses , and if the buses perform well, the agency plans to acquire its first three BEBs in 2021 using funds from the Volkswagen emissions scandal and resulting lawsuit and settlement. On April 22, 2022, Mountain Metro unveiled four new all electric Proterra ZX5 buses to be added to their fleet. The new buses join their current fleet of 67 clean diesel buses. They are funded by the Colorado Department of Transportation Division of Transit and Rail Settlement Transit Bus Replacement Program, Volkswagen Diesel Emission Settlement trust, and Federal transit Administration 5339 Buses and Bus Facilities Program grant. The Proterra ZX5 buses run 220 to 330 miles on a single charge, and cost 1.2 million per bus.  Mountain Metro Mobility  Mountain Metro Mobility is an Americans with Disabilities Act federally mandated complementary ADA paratransit service, which provides demand response service for individuals with mobility needs that prevent them from using the fixed route bus system.  Mountain Metro Rides  Mountain Metro Rides offers alternative transportation options to residents of the Pikes Peak Region. The program is designed to reduce congestion and pollution by encouraging people to commute by carpool, vanpool, bicycling or walking.  Bustang  Bustang provides intercity transportation to Colorado Springs. It is part of the South and Outrider lines, which connect to Denver and to Lamar. There is an additional line that connects Colorado Springs directly to the Denver Tech Center.  Notable people   Sister cities  Colorado Springs' sister cities are: Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan Kaohsiung, Taiwan Smolensk, Smolensk Oblast, Russia Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico Canterbury Bankstown, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Olympia, Peloponnese, Greece Colorado Springs's sister city organization began when it became partners with Fujiyoshida. The torii gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The torii gate, crisscrossed bridge and shrine, in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets downtown, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the torii gate states that the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities . The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.In 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP performed with the Youth Symphony and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale as part of the annual In Harmony program. A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities is their geographic positions: three of the seven cities are near the foot of a major mountain or mountain range, as is Colorado Springs.

            "text": "Electricity generation is the process of generating electric power from sources of primary energy. For utilities in the electric power industry, it is the stage prior to its delivery to end users or its storage . Electricity is not freely available in nature, so it must be produced . Production is carried out in power stations . Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power. There are also exotic and speculative methods to recover energy, such as proposed fusion reactor designs which aim to directly extract energy from intense magnetic fields generated by fast moving charged particles generated by the fusion reaction . Phasing out coal fired power stations and eventually gas fired power stations, or capturing their greenhouse gas emissions, is an important part of the energy transformation required to limit climate change. Vastly more solar power and wind power is forecast to be required, with electricity demand increasing strongly with further electrification of transport, homes and industry.  History  The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist Michael Faraday. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or Faraday disc, between the poles of a magnet. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of alternating current power transmission, using power transformers to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss. Commercial electricity production started with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. The mechanical production of electric power began the Second Industrial Revolution and made possible several inventions using electricity, with the major contributors being Thomas Alva Edison and Nikola Tesla. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the telegraph. Electricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a steam engine driving a dynamo at Pearl Street Station produced a DC current that powered public lighting on Pearl Street, New York. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas fueled street lights to electric power. Soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains. The first power plants used water power or coal. Today a variety of energy sources are used, such as coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, wind, and oil, as well as solar energy, tidal power, and geothermal sources. In the 1880s the popularity of electricity grew massively with the introduction of the Incandescent light bulb. Although there are 22 recognised inventors of the light bulb prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison, Edison and Swan's invention became by far the most successful and popular of all. During the early years of the 19th century, massive jumps in electrical sciences were made. And by the later 19th century the advancement of electrical technology and engineering led to electricity being part of everyday life. With the introduction of many electrical inventions and their implementation into everyday life, the demand for electricity within homes grew dramatically. With this increase in demand, the potential for profit was seen by many entrepreneurs who began investing into electrical systems to eventually create the first electricity public utilities. This process in history is often described as electrification.The earliest distribution of electricity came from companies operating independently of one another. A consumer would purchase electricity from a producer, and the producer would distribute it through their own power grid. As technology improved so did the productivity and efficiency of its generation. Inventions such as the steam turbine had a massive impact on the efficiency of electrical generation but also the economics of generation as well. This conversion ofheat energy into mechanical work was similar to that of steam engines, however at a significantly larger scale and far more productively. The improvements of these large scale generation plants were critical to the process of centralised generation as they would become vital to the entire power system that we now use today. Throughout the middle of the 20th century many utilities began merging their distribution networks due to economic and efficiency benefits. Along with the invention of long distance power transmission, the coordination of power plants began to form. This system was then secured by regional system operators to ensure stability and reliability. The electrification of homes began in Northern Europe and in the Northern America in the 1920s in large cities and urban areas. It wasn't until the 1930s that rural areas saw the large scale establishment of electrification.  Methods of generation  Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. Utility scale generation is achieved by rotating electric generators or by photovoltaic systems. A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries. Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the triboelectric effect, the piezoelectric effect, the thermoelectric effect, and betavoltaics.  Generators  Electric generators transform kinetic energy into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on Faraday's law. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material . Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which mechanical energy forces a generator to rotate.  Electrochemistry  Electrochemistry is the direct transformation of chemical energy into electricity, as in a battery. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries. Primary cells, such as the common zinc carbon batteries, act as power sources directly, but secondary cells are used for storage systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as fuel cells, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. Osmotic power is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge.  Photovoltaic effect  The photovoltaic effect is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to DC electricity. Power inverters can then convert that to AC electricity if needed. Although sunlight is free and abundant, solar power electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30 conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40 efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by around 20 per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, United States, China, and India.  Economics  The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in widespread residential selling prices. Hydroelectric plants, nuclear power plants, thermal power plants and renewable sources have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, often supplied by plants which run continuously. Nuclear, coal, oil, gas and some hydro plants can supply base load. If well construction costs for natural gas are below 10 per MWh, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, nuclear disasters have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high. Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle.  Generating equipment  Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of electromagnetic induction in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.  Turbines  Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a turbine, driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including heat engines, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by heat engines. The combustion of fossil fuels supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from nuclear fission and some from renewable sources. The modern steam turbine currently generates about 80 of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include: Steam Water is boiled by coal burned in a thermal power plant. About 41 of all electricity is generated this way. Nuclear fission heat created in a nuclear reactor creates steam. Less than 15 of electricity is generated this way. Renewable energy. The steam is generated by biomass, solar thermal energy, or geothermal power. Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion. Combined cycle are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20 of the world's electricity is generated by natural gas. Water Energy is captured by a water turbine from the movement of water from falling water, the rise and fall of tides or ocean thermal currents . Currently, hydroelectric plants provide approximately 16 of the world's electricity. The windmill was a very early wind turbine. In 2018 around 5 of the world's electricity was produced from wind.Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by gasoline or diesel engines. These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages.  Production Total worldwide gross production of electricity in 2016 was 25 082 TWh. Sources of electricity were coal and peat 38.3 , natural gas 23.1 , hydroelectric 16.6 , nuclear power 10.4 , oil 3.7 , solar wind geothermal tidal other 5.6 , biomass and waste 2.3 .In 2021, Wind and solar generated electricity reached 10 of globally produced electricity. Clean sources generated 38 of the world's electricity.  Historical results of production of electricity   Production by country  The United States has long been the largest producer and consumer of electricity, with a global share in 2005 of at least 25 , followed by China, Japan, Russia, and India. In 2011, China overtook the United States to become the largest producer of electricity.  Environmental concerns  Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10 of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70 and China is at 80 . The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Methane leaks and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65 of all emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main component of acid rain. Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of NOx, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter in the US.According to the International Energy Agency , low carbon electricity generation needs to account for 85 of global electrical output by 2040 in order to ward off the worst effects of climate change. Like other organizations including the Energy Impact Center and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe , the IEA has called for the expansion of nuclear and renewable energy to meet that objective. Some, like EIC founder Bret Kugelmass, believe that nuclear power is the primary method for decarbonizing electricity generation because it can also power direct air capture that removes existing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Nuclear power plants can also create district heating and desalination projects, limiting carbon emissions and the need for expanded electrical output.A fundamental issue regarding centralised generation and the current electrical generation methods in use today is the significant negative environmental effects that many of the generation processes have. Processes such as coal and gas not only release carbon dioxide as they combust, but their extraction from the ground also impacts the environment. Open pit coal mines use large areas of land to extract coal and limit the potential for productive land use after the excavation. Natural gas extraction releases large amounts of methane into the atmosphere when extracted from the ground greatly increase global greenhouse gases. Although nuclear power plants do not release carbon dioxide through electricity generation, there are significant risks associated with nuclear waste and safety concerns associated with the use of nuclear sources. This fear of nuclear power stems from large scale nuclear catastrophes such as the Chernobyl Disaster and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Both tragedies led to significant casualties and the radioactive contamination of large areas.Per unit of electricity generated coal and gas fired power life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are almost always at least ten times that of other generation methods.  Centralised and distributed generation Centralised generation is electricity generation by large scale centralised facilities, sent through transmission lines to consumers. These facilities are usually located far away from consumers and distribute the electricity through high voltage transmission lines to a substation, where it is then distributed to consumers; the basic concept being that multi megawatt or gigawatt scale large stations create electricity for a large number of people. The vast majority of electricity used is created from centralised generation. Most centralised power generation comes from large power plants run by fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, though nuclear or large hydroelectricity plants are also commonly used. Centralised generation is fundamentally the opposite of distributed generation. Distributed generation is the small scale generation of electricity to smaller groups of consumers. This can also include independently producing electricity by either solar or wind power. In recent years distributed generation as has seen a spark in popularity due to its propensity to use renewable energy generation methods such as rooftop solar.  Technologies Centralised energy sources are large power plants that produce huge amounts of electricity to a large number of consumers. Most power plants used in centralised generation are thermal power plants meaning that they use a fuel to heat steam to produce a pressurised gas which in turn spins a turbine and generates electricity. This is the traditional way of producing energy. This process relies on several forms of technology to produce widespread electricity, these being natural coal, gas and nuclear forms of thermal generation. More recently solar and wind have become large scale.  Solar   Wind   Coal   Natural gas  Natural gas is ignited to create pressurised gas which is used to spin turbines to generate electricity. Natural gas plants use a gas turbine where natural gas is added along with oxygen which in turn combusts and expands through the turbine to force a generator to spin. Natural gas power plants are more efficient than coal power generation, they however contribute to climate change but not as highly as coal generation. Not only do they produce carbon dioxide from the ignition of natural gas, but also the extraction of gas when mined releases a significant amount of methane into the atmosphere.  Nuclear  Nuclear power plants create electricity through steam turbines where the heat input is from the process of nuclear fission. Currently, nuclear power produces 11 of all electricity in the world. Most nuclear reactors use uranium as a source of fuel. In a process called nuclear fission, energy, in the form of heat, is released when nuclear atoms are split. Electricity is created through the use of a nuclear reactor where heat produced by nuclear fission is used to produce steam which in turn spins turbines and powers the generators. Although there are several types of nuclear reactors, all fundamentally use this process.Normal emissions due to nuclear power plants are primarily waste heat and radioactive spent fuel. In a reactor accident, significant amounts of radioisotopes can be released to the environment, posing a long term hazard to life. This hazard has been a continuing concern of environmentalists. Accidents such as the Three Mile Island accident, Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima nuclear disaster illustrate this problem.  See also   References",

            "text": "The war of the currents was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s; arc lamp street lighting running on high voltage alternating current , and large scale low voltage direct current indoor incandescent lighting being marketed by Thomas Edison's company. In 1886, the Edison system was faced with new competition: an alternating current system developed by George Westinghouse's company that used transformers to step down from a high voltage so AC could be used for indoor lighting. Using high voltage allowed an AC system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations. As the use of AC spread rapidly, the Edison Electric Light Company claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous, and that the design was inferior to, and infringed on the patents behind, their direct current system. In the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole mounted high voltage AC lines, attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that used them. In June of that year Harold P. Brown, a New York electrical engineer, claimed the AC based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high voltage systems installed in a slipshod manner. Brown also claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents, with technical assistance from Edison Electric. The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. Both also colluded with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator. By the early 1890s the war was winding down. Further deaths caused by AC lines in New York City forced electric companies to fix safety problems. Mergers reduced competition between companies, including the merger of Edison Electric with their chief AC rival, Thomson Houston, forming General Electric in 1892. The new company now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and won the major part of the contract to build Niagara Falls hydroelectric project later that year . DC commercial power distribution systems declined rapidly in numbers throughout the 20th century; the last DC system in New York City was shut down in 2007.  Background  The war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; arc lighting running on alternating current and incandescent lighting running on direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large area street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential indoor lighting.  Arc lighting  By the late 1870s, arc lamp systems were beginning to be installed in cities, powered by central generating plants. Arc lighting was capable of lighting streets, factory yards, or the interior of large buildings. Arc lamp systems used high voltages to supply current to multiple series connected lamps, and some ran better on alternating current.1880 saw the installation of large scale arc lighting systems in several US cities including a central station set up by the Brush Electric Company in December 1880 to supply a 2 mile length of Broadway in New York City with a 3,500 volt demonstration arc lighting system. The disadvantages of arc lighting were: it was maintenance intensive, buzzed, flickered, constituted a fire hazard, was really only suitable for outdoor lighting, and, at the high voltages used, was dangerous to work with.  Edison's DC company  In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems. By 1882 the investor owned utility Edison Illuminating Company was established in New York City. Edison designed his utility to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.  AC transformer development in Europe  Alternating current had been under development with contributions by Guillaume Duchenne , the dynamo work of Z nobe Gramme, Ganz Works , Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti , Lucien Gaulard, and Galileo Ferraris. Starting in the 1880s alternating current gained its key advantage over direct current with the development of functional transformers that allowed the voltage to be stepped up to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use. The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to 7 mile long circuits.Using induction coils to transfer power between electrical circuits had been around for 40 years with Pavel Yablochkov using them in his lighting system in 1876 and Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs using the principle to create a step down transformer in 1882, but the design was not very efficient. A prototype of the high efficiency, closed core shunt connection transformer was made by the Hungarian Z.B.D. team at Ganz Works in 1884. The new Z.B.D. transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. Transformers in use today are designed based on principles discovered by the three engineers. Their patents included another major related innovation: the use of parallel connected power distribution. Ott Bl thy also invented the first AC electricity meter. The reliability of this type of AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified Rome, a large metropolis, in 1886.  Westinghouse enters the AC business  In North America the inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghouse entered the electric lighting business in 1884 when he started to develop a DC system and hired William Stanley, Jr. to work on it. Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater economies of scale could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well as lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a step down transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents. The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with their short transmission range also meant there was a patchwork of un supplied customers between Edison's plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power. Westinghouse purchased the US patents rights to the Gaulard Gibbs transformer and imported several of those as well as Siemens AC generators to begin experimenting with an AC based lighting system in Pittsburgh. William Stanley used the Gaulard Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The Westinghouse Electric Company was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location. By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and Oliver B. Shallenberger had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in Buffalo, New York.  The spread of AC  By the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts had built 22 power stations. Thomson Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their Sawyer Man incandescent bulb patent. Besides Thomson Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time included the United States Illuminating Company and the Waterhouse Electric Light Company. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.  Safety concerns  Elihu Thomson of Thomson Houston was concerned about AC safety and put a great deal of effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have. Thomson also worried about what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installation until a safer transformer could be developed.Due to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground. The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6,000 volts. Insulation on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value as a molasses covered rag , and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time. A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an eyesore, New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.  Edison's anti AC stance  As AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison's low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison's own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison's sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president Edward Hibberd Johnson pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid sized cities. Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea. After Westinghouse installed his first large scale system, Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically. Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system. Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system and he worried that a death caused by a mis installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general. Edison's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture. Edison was also of the opinion that DC was a superior system and inferior AC technology was being used by other companies as a way to get around his DC patents.In February 1888 Edison Electric president Edward Johnson published an 84 page pamphlet titled A Warning from the Edison Electric Light Company and sent it to newspapers and to companies that had purchased or were planning to purchase electrical equipment from Edison competitors, including Westinghouse and Thomson Houston, stating that the competitors were infringing on Edison's incandescent light and other electrical patents. It warned that purchasers could find themselves on the losing side of a court case if those patents were upheld. The pamphlet also emphasized the safety and efficiency of direct current, with the claim DC had not caused a single death, and included newspaper stories of accidental electrocutions caused by alternating current.  Execution by electricity  As arc lighting systems spread so did stories of how the high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead. One such story in 1881 of a drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, New York dentist Alfred P. Southwick to seek some application for the curious phenomenon. He worked with local physician George E. Fell and the Buffalo ASPCA, electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, to come up with a method to euthanize animals via electricity. Southwick's 1882 and 1883 articles on how electrocution could be a replacement for hanging, using a restraint similar to a dental chair caught the attention of New York State politicians who, following a series of botched hangings, were desperately seeking an alternative. An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor David B. Hill, which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.There were early indications that this new form of execution would become mixed up with the war of currents. As part of their fact finding, the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including Elihu Thomson and Thomas Edison. In late 1887, when death penalty commission member Southwick contacted Edison, the inventor stated he was against capital punishment and wanted nothing to do with the matter. After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by 'alternating machines,' manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse . Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state's new form of execution. Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies was Edison's tongue in cheek answer.  Anti AC backlash As the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the deadly arc lighting current and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it. These deaths included a 15 year old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had been energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line; a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line; and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to death by wire incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.  Harold Brown's crusade  At this point an electrical engineer named Harold P. Brown, who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company, sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the New York Post claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current system being used. Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and damnable and asked why the public must submit to constant danger from sudden death just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system. At the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation. He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs . Edison thanked him but said My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time .On June 8, Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting's record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting voltage to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Brown's claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied. A July edition of The Electrical Journal covered Brown's appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC and noted that: The battle of the currents is being fought this week in New York. At a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown's criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.  Brown's demonstrations  Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments. Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant Arthur Kennelly. Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current. After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College. With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1,000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC. Brown wrote to a colleague that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts was unsuccessful but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.  Collusion with Edison  What brought Brown to the forefront of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear, but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown. Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings who came up with the idea of using Brown and several New York physicians to attack Westinghouse and the other AC companies in retaliation for what Hastings thought were unscrupulous bids by Westinghouse for lighting contracts in Denver and Minneapolis. Hasting brought Brown and Edison together and was in continual contact with Brown. Edison Electric seemed to be footing the bill for some of Brown's publications on the dangers of AC. In addition, Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of Scranton, Pennsylvania recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC. Some of this collusion was exposed in letters stolen from Brown's office and published in August 1889.  Patents and mergers  During this period Westinghouse continued to pour money and engineering resources into the goal of building a completely integrated AC system. To gain control of the Sawyer Man lamp patents he bought Consolidated Electric Light in 1887. He bought the Waterhouse Electric Light Company in 1888 and the United States Illuminating Company in 1890, giving Westinghouse their own arc lighting systems as well as control over all the major incandescent lamp patents not controlled by Edison. In April 1888 Westinghouse engineer Oliver B. Shallenberger developed an induction meter that used a rotating magnetic field for measuring alternating current, giving the company a way to calculate how much electricity a customer used. In July 1888 Westinghouse paid a substantial amount to license Nikola Tesla's US patents for a poly phase AC induction motor and obtained a patent option on Galileo Ferraris' induction motor design. Although the acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, the general shortage of cash the company was going through by 1890 meant development had to be put on hold for a while. The difficulties of obtaining funding for such a capital intensive business was becoming a serious problem for the company and 1890 saw the first of several attempts by investor J. P. Morgan to take over Westinghouse Electric.Thomson Houston was continuing to expand, buying seven smaller electric companies including a purchase of the Brush Electric Company in 1889. By 1890 Thomson Houston controlled the majority of the arc lighting systems in the US and a collection of its own US AC patents. Several of the business deals between Thomson Houston and Westinghouse fell apart and in April 1888 a judge rolled back part of Westinghouse's original Gaulard Gibbs patent, stating it only covered transformers linked in series.With the help of the financier Henry Villard the Edison group of companies also went through a series of mergers: Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent holding company and the financial arm backed by J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt family for Edison's lighting experiments, merged. The new company, Edison General Electric Company, was formed in January 1889 with the help of Drexel, Morgan Co. and Grosvenor Lowrey with Villard as president. It later included the Sprague Electric Railway Motor Company.  The peak of the war Through the fall of 1888 a battle of words with Brown specifically attacking Westinghouse continued to escalate. In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown's assertion in the pages of the Electrical Engineer that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.  Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair  Although New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns. The New York Medico Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.After the Medico Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman Frederick Peterson, who had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned with some committee members pointing out that Brown's experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3000 volts although the type of electricity, direct current or alternating current, was not determined. In order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory. There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico Legal Society's December meeting recommended the use of 1000 1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current. On December 13 in a letter to the New York Times, Westinghouse spelled out where Brown's experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown's December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses. Westinghouse declined the offer. In March 1889 when members of the Medico Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance. Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test. They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests. Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons Austin Lathrop asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment. The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind the scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson Houston. Thomson Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson Houston AC generators. Thomson Houston president Charles Coffin had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company's equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse's sales claim of manufacturing 50 more efficient generators was false.That spring Brown published The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current detailing the animal experiments done at Edison's lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier than DC. This 61 page professionally printed booklet was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5000 inhabitants.In May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named William Kemmler, there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the New York Times as to what to call the then new form of execution. The term Westinghoused was put forward as well as Gerrycide , and Browned . The Times hated the word that was eventually adopted, electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by pretentious ignoramuses . One of Edison's lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison's preference for dynamort, ampermort and electromort were not good terms but thought Westinghoused was the best choice.  The Kemmler appeal  William Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected lawyer who filed the appeal, William Bourke Cockran, had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.During fact finding hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross examiner and orator to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower current DC and high current AC. When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct industrial espionage. Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the wizard of Menlo Park that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.After the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler's appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler's appeal on May 23, 1890.When the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging. George Westinghouse commented: They would have done better using an axe.  Brown's collusion exposed  On August 25, 1889 the New York Sun ran a story headlined: For Shame, Brown! Disgraceful Facts About the Electric Killing Scheme; Queer Work for a State's Expert; Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another The story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's collusion with Thomson Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received 5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of Missouri , Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.Brown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.  The Electric Wire Panic  1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor Hugh J. Grant, in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office . On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.Feeks' public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the Electric Wire Panic . The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, Westinghouse having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks' death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary. Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks' death, pointing out men's lives were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with manslaughter. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans Times Picayune noted Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed. Harold Brown's reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines. At the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the North American Review titled The Dangers of Electric Lighting . Edison put forward the view that burying the high voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a constant menace that could short with other lines threatening people's homes and lives. He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.George Westinghouse was suddenly put in the role of a villain trying to defend pole mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe and fumbled at reporters' questions trying to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous. The next month he did better in his response printed in the North American Review, pointing out that his AC transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting versus only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in home deaths attributed to AC current.The crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York aldermen due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground. The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness. The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the New York Supreme Court in December. The AC lines were cut down keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter since little had been done by the overpaid Tammany Hall city supervisors who were supposed to see to building the underground subways to house them.  The current war ends Even with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business. Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric. In 1890 he told president Henry Villard he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time. Edison's dogmatic anti AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 Edison Machine Works began developing AC based equipment. With Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger. Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson Houston, which was now Edison General Electric's biggest competitor. Thomson Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles. Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger. As a committee of financiers, which included J.P. Morgan, worked on the deal in early 1892 things went against Villard. In Morgan's view Thomson Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson Houston in control of the new company, now called General Electric . Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened. The fifteen electric companies that existed five years before had merged down to two; General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. From this point on General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems. Edison put on a brave face noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.  Aftermath  Even though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger, the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger. Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered universal system these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of rotary converters and motor generators that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid. These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded. In May 1892 Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe and effective highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at Niagara Falls. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field due partly to Charles Proteus Steinmetz, a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.A three phase three wire transmission system had already been deployed in Europe at the International Electro Technical Exhibition of 1891, where Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky used this system to transmit electric power over a distance of 176 km with 75 efficiency. In 1891 he also created a three phase transformer, the short circuited induction motor and designed the world's first three phase hydroelectric power plant. Patent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing agreement between the two companies that remained in force for 11 years.In 1897 Edison sold his remaining stock in Edison Electric Illuminating of New York to finance his iron ore refining prototype plant. In 1908 Edison said to George Stanley, son of AC transformer inventor William Stanley, Jr., Tell your father I was wrong , probably admitting he had underestimated the developmental potential of alternating current.  Remnant and existent DC systems  Some cities continued to use DC well into the 20th century. For example, central Helsinki had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A mercury arc valve rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances used by Boston University students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. New York City's electric utility company, Consolidated Edison, continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The New Yorker Hotel, constructed in 1929, had a large direct current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating current service until well into the 1960s. This was the building in which AC pioneer Nikola Tesla spent his last years, and where he died in 1943. New York City's Broadway theaters continued to use DC services until 1975, requiring the use of outmoded manual resistance dimmer boards operated by several stagehands. This practice ended when the musical A Chorus Line introduced computerized lighting control and thyristor dimmers to Broadway, and New York theaters were finally converted to AC.In January 1998, Consolidated Edison started to eliminate DC service. At that time there were 4,600 DC customers. By 2006, there were only 60 customers using DC service, and on November 14, 2007, the last direct current distribution by Con Edison was shut down. Customers still using DC were provided with on site AC to DC rectifiers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company still provides DC power to some locations in San Francisco, primarily for elevators, supplied by close to 200 rectifiers each providing power for 7 10 customers.The Central Electricity Generating Board in the UK maintained a 200 volt DC generating station at Bankside Power Station in London until 1981. It exclusively powered DC printing machinery in Fleet Street, then the heart of the UK's newspaper industry. It was decommissioned later in 1981 when the newspaper industry moved into the developing docklands area further down the river . High voltage direct current systems are used for bulk transmission of energy from distant generating stations or for interconnection of separate alternating current systems.

            "text": "Charles W. Batchelor was an inventor and close associate of American inventor Thomas Alva Edison during much of Edison's career. He was involved in some of the greatest inventions and technological developments in history.  Biographical Information Charles Batchelor was born on Christmas Day, 1845, and raised in Manchester, England. He was a draftsman and machinist, and later on in his life he was Thomas Alva Edison's friend and right hand man. In 1870, while working for a textile equipment manufacturer, he was sent to the United States to install some equipment in a Newark, New Jersey textile factory. At this time Thomas Edison's main laboratory and shop were also located in Newark where the two met. By the end of October 1871 Batchelor was working at Edison's American Telegraph Works, and by the summer of 1873 was assisting Edison in inventing. Charles Batchelor became one of Edison's closest laboratory assistants and business partners during the 1870s and 1880s. He assisted Edison with some of his most important projects in the fields of telegraphy, telephony, the phonograph, and electric lighting. As a gifted experimenter, he was Edison's hands, testing, tinkering with, and improving the models and apparatus built for Edison by John Kruesi. In 1873, Edison named his friend Batch as chief experimental assistant . Together Batchelor and Edison would come up with prospective products. Edison also frequently entrusted him with responsibility for special projects. In 1879, he went to London to supervise technical operations of the Edison Telephone Company of Great Britain, but he became ill there and returned to Menlo Park. Two years later Batchelor, installed a model of an electrical lighting station for the 1881 International Exposition of Electricity in Paris. Batchelor stayed there for the next three years as manager of the Edison electric light companies that were established in France. It was Edison's practice to give his key assistants shares in his companies and to let them invest in the business ventures that resulted from their inventive activity. Along with other Edison assistants such as Samuel Insull, John Kruesi, Francis Upton, and Edward H. Johnson, Batchelor was an investor in Edison manufacturing enterprises, beginning with the Edison Electric Light Company , and continuing with the Edison Lamp Company , the Edison Machine Works , which Batchelor managed between 1884 through 1888, and the Edison General Electric Company . It was through their positions as both investors and employees of these concerns, that Edison and his men derived much of their income. While in Paris, Charles Batchelor also recognized the skills of a young engineer named Nikola Tesla. In 1884 when Batchelor was brought back to the US to manage the Edison Machine Works, he asked that Tesla be brought to the US as well.In 1887, when Edison relocated his experimental laboratory to West Orange, New Jersey, Batchelor supervised the construction of the buildings. He later became Treasurer and General Manager of the General Electric Company . The General Electric Company grew to become one of the largest Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Following his retirement from General Electric, Batchelor returned in 1899 to work for Edison Ore Milling Company. After the failure of the ore refining business , Batchelor left Edison's employ to pursue work elsewhere. Their working relationship lasted thirty years. He traveled with his wife Rosanna and their daughters, worked selling securities, and eventually became president of Taylor Foundry Company. At the time of his death on New Year's Day 1910 Batchelor was President of the Taylor Foundry Company.  Biographies Welch, Walter L. . Charles Batchelor: Edison's chief partner.

            "text": "The Nikola Tesla Memorial Center is a cultural historical site and museum located in Smiljan, Croatia, located at the birthplace of Nikola Tesla, one of the world's foremost engineers and inventors. It is dedicated to Tesla, who was born in 1856 in his Serb parents house in Smiljan, then part of the Croatian Military Frontier within the Habsburg monarchy. The young engineer later left his homeland to work in the United States of America. The Lika Museum in nearby Gospi administers the site.  History The Memorial Center was opened to the public on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birthday, 10 July 2006, by the President of the Republic of Croatia. The original memorial site was first established as a museum in 1956, but it was damaged during the Croatian War of Independence when a projectile fell on the commercial building next to Nikola Tesla's house. The fire was eventually put out by the Croatian Army who deposited furniture and other objects it saved in the Museum of Lika. The Croatian authorities restored the complex and reopened it in a 2006 ceremony, with the highest dignitaries of Croatia and Serbia attending. After the war it was renovated, improved, equipped and opened as Memorial Center in 2006.  Architecture and exhibits On its surface area of 1.37 square kilometres, the memorial complex contains various components: museum in the birth house of Nikola Tesla , the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Peter and Paul, an old agricultural building, village cemetery, Tesla's testing station, stone monuments, benches and river banks designed by architect Zdenko Kolacio, metal statue of Nikola Tesla made by sculptor Mile Bla evi , open air auditorium, prototypes of some Tesla's inventions , multimedia center etc. Various scientific and educational activities or presentations are occasionally organized in the Memorial Center. Over the past years the number of visitors coming to the site has been steadily growing. 41,000 tourists from many countries from all over the world visited the center in 2016. In 2018 this number increased to over 44,000 people.

            "text": "George Sylvester Viereck was a German American poet, writer, and pro German propagandist.  Biography   Early life  Sylvester's father, Louis Viereck, was born in Berlin in 1851, to the unmarried actress Edwina Viereck. It was rumored that Louis was the son of Kaiser William I, but Louis was acknowledged as a son instead by Louis von Prillwitz, a son of Prince Augustus of Prussia. In 1870, Louis joined the Socialist Party, and was banished from Berlin eight years later under Otto von Bismarck's Anti Socialist Laws. In 1881 he became editor of a socialist periodical in Munich. In 1884 he was elected to the Reichstag, but in 1886 was imprisoned for attending Socialist Party meetings. He left the Party upon his release from prison.Sylvester's mother, Laura Viereck, was born in San Francisco to William Viereck, a younger brother of Edwina Viereck. William was an unsuccessful revolutionary who had fled the German States like other Forty Eighters and operated a German theatre in San Francisco. After William's death in 1865, his wife returned to Germany with their children. In 1881, Laura married her first cousin Louis. At her urging, Louis emigrated to the United States in 1896, and Laura followed with Sylvester some months later. Louis became an American citizen in 1901, but he returned to Germany in 1911.George Sylvester Viereck was born in Munich on 31 December 1884. Sylvester began writing poetry when he was eleven. His heroes were Jesus Christ, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Oscar Wilde. While still in college, in 1904, George Sylvester Viereck, with the help of literary critic Ludwig Lewisohn, published his first collection of poems. He graduated from the College of the City of New York in 1906. The next year his collection Nineveh and Other Poems won Viereck national fame. A number were written in the style of the Uranian male love poetry of the time.The Saturday Evening Post called Viereck the most widely discussed young literary man in the United States today .Between 1907 and 1912, Viereck turned into a Germanophile. In 1908, he published the best selling Confessions of a Barbarian. Viereck lectured at the University of Berlin on American poetry in 1911. For his support of Germany and pacifism, Viereck was expelled from several social clubs and fraternal organizations, and had a falling out with a close friend, poet Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff.During World War I he edited a German sponsored weekly magazine, The Fatherland with a claimed circulation of 80,000. In August 1918, a lynch mob stormed Viereck's house in Mount Vernon, forcing him to seek refuge in a New York City hotel. In 1919, shortly after the Great War, he was expelled from the Poetry Society of America.  International success  In 1923, Viereck published a popular science book entitled Rejuvenation: How Steinach Makes People Young, which drew the attention of Sigmund Freud, who wrote Viereck asking if he would write a similar book about psychoanalysis. Viereck traveled to Vienna to interview Freud, and then went to Munich to interview Adolf Hitler. During the mid 1920s, Viereck went on several additional tours of Europe, interviewing Marshal Foch, Georges Clemenceau, George Bernard Shaw, Oswald Spengler, Benito Mussolini, Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians, Henry Ford, Albert Moll, Magnus Hirschfeld, and Albert Einstein. Viereck became close friends with Nikola Tesla. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife. He dedicated his poem Fragments of Olympian Gossip to Viereck, a work in which Tesla ridiculed the scientific establishment of the day.  Support for Hitler  Viereck founded two publications, The International and The Fatherland, which argued the German cause during World War I. Viereck became a well known supporter of Nazism. In 1933, Viereck again met with Hitler, now Germany's leader, in Berlin, and in 1934, he gave a speech to twenty thousand Friends of the New Germany at New York's Madison Square Garden, in which he compared Hitler to Franklin D. Roosevelt and told his audience to sympathize with Nazism without being antisemites. His Jewish friends denounced him as George Swastika Viereck , but he continued to promote Nazism.In 1941, he was indicted in the U.S. for a violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act when he set up his publishing house, Flanders Hall, in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. He was convicted in 1942 for this failure to register with the U. S. Department of State as a Nazi agent. He was imprisoned from 1942 to 1947.  Post war  Viereck's memoir of life in prison, Men Into Beasts, was published as a paperback original by Fawcett Publications in 1952. The book is a general memoir of discomfort, loss of dignity, and brutality in prison life. The front matter and backcover text focuses on the situational homosexuality and male rape described in the book . Viereck also published a vampire novel, The House of the Vampire , which is one of the first psychic vampire stories where a vampire feeds off more than just blood.  Family He had two sons, George and Peter. George was killed in action during the Second World War. His other son, Peter Viereck, was a historian, political writer and poet. A 2005 The New Yorker article discusses how the younger Viereck both rejected and was shaped by the ideologies of his father.  Reception The poem Slaves published in the 1924 collection The Three Sphinxes and Other Poems inspired the title of the 1968 psychothriller Twisted Nerve, and is quoted several times in the film: A twisted nerve, a ganglion gone awry, Predestinates the sinner and the saint.

            "text": "Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X ray imaging. He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high voltage, high frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.  Early years  Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire , on 10 July O.S. 28 June 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla , was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Tesla's mother, uka Mandi , whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. uka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospi , where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro Hungarian Military Frontier. Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this mysterious phenomena made him want to know more of this wonderful force . Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four year term in three years, graduating in 1873.After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla's father , promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gra ac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.He enrolled at the Imperial Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. In his autobiography Tesla said he worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, Your son is a star of first rank. At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob P schl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating. But by his third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla wasn't studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing. Tesla's family did not hear from him after he left school. There was a rumor amongst his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor across the border in Slovenia and reported that encounter to Tesla's family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home and take up his education in Prague. Tesla returned to Gospi later that month when he was deported for not having a residence permit. Tesla's father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospi . In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospi for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.  Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange  Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Pusk s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.  Working at Edison In 1882, Tivadar Pusk s got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Soci t Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry sur Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.  Moving to the United States  In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 field engineers struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their Parisian being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that this is a damned good man . One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a 50,000 bonus to design twenty four different types of standard machines but it turned out to be a practical joke . Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping Tesla, you don't understand our American humor . The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that amount of cash on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying Good by to the Edison Machine Works .  Tesla Electric Light Manufacturing Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light Manufacturing. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features. The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for 2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery .  AC and the induction motor  In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1 3 to Tesla, 1 3 to Peck and Brown, and 1 3 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices. In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current , a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long distance, high voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor . This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator less, rotating magnetic field based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market. In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for 60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of 2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of 2,000 per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60 cycle AC system that Tesla proposed , but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.  Market turmoil  Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a war of currents propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a 15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it was even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to deal with the bankers to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of 216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric .  New York laboratories  The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years working out of a series of workshop laboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street , the fourth floor of 33 35 South Fifth Avenue , and sixth and seventh floors of 46 48 East Houston Street . Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.  Tesla coil  In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886 1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. Tesla found this new discovery refreshing and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his oscillating transformer , with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high voltage, low current, high frequency alternating current electricity. He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.  Citizenship  On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.  Wireless lighting  After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires by conducting it through the Earth.Tesla served as a vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern day IEEE .  Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition  By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the Tesla Polyphase System . They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the Electricity Building devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high voltage, high frequency alternating current to light wireless gas discharge lamps.An observer noted: Within the room were suspended two hard rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, where they produced so much wonder and astonishment .  Steam powered oscillating generator  During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.  Consulting on Niagara  In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two phase and three phase AC, high voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.  The Nikola Tesla Company  In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors since the mid 1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.  Lab fire  In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say? . After the fire Tesla moved to 46 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.  X ray experimentation  Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of invisible kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments . His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X ray image predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm R ntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X rays when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.In March 1896, after hearing of R ntgen's discovery of X ray and X ray imaging , Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil . In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus .Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single node X ray producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him: Tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his electric gun , Tesla said, The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations .  Radio remote control  In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer based radio control which he dubbed telautomaton to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate Teleautomatics in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.  Wireless power  From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications. At the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of invisible light would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming hopelessly lost .By the mid 1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth's atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages long distances.  Colorado Springs  To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest 100,000 to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris. There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage. The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. During his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article entitled Talking With Planets , where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing intelligently controlled signals and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's European experiments in July 1899 Marconi may have transmitted the letter S in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled The Problem of Increasing Human Energy , appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.  Wardenclyffe  Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf Astoria's Palm Garden , The Players Club, and Delmonico's. In March 1901, he obtained 150,000 from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51 share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own. He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling vibrations throughout the globe . Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of 187 feet . In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf Astoria, which eventually amounted to 20,000 . He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.  Later years After Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after the great man died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.  Bladeless turbine  On his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910 1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100 5,000 hp. Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis Chalmers. He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.  Wireless lawsuits  When World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for 1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.  Nobel Prize rumors  On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X rays . There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous ; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the 20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel prize .  Other awards, patents and ideas  Tesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include: Grand Officer of the Order of St. Sava Elliott Cresson Medal Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I AIEE Edison Medal Grand Cross of the Order of St. Sava Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown John Scott Medal Order of the White Eagle Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion Medal of the University of Paris The Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida Tesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel. He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity, wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, saturating the schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.' The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries. In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an electric ray of tremendous frequency, with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen . Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. mile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly .In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take off and landing , which gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than 1,000. Although the aircraft has been described as impractical, it has early resemblances to the V 22 Osprey used by the US military. At this point Tesla closed his remaining office located at 350 Madison Ave, having moved there two years earlier.  Living circumstances  Tesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. He moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. He said that he had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. He spent over 2,000 to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed. Tesla stated: I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life. Tesla's unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric Manufacturing Company began paying him 125 per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being couched as a consulting fee to get around Tesla's aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of unspecified settlement . In any case, Westinghouse provided the funds for Tesla for the rest of his life.  Birthday press conferences  In 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption All the world's his power house noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims. At the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933 at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was violently opposed to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He called it teleforce , but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams . Tesla tried to attract interest of the US War Department, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.In 1935 at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure. He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called Telegeodynamics , using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In his 1937 Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.  Death  In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla's room, ignoring the do not disturb sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis . Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items. After a three day investigation, Trump's report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating: His Tesla's thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. In a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's death ray , Trump found a 45 year old multidecade resistance box. On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio while violin pieces Ave Maria and Tamo daleko were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla's body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel in New York City.  Estate  In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovi , Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanovi 's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a gold plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.  Patents  Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.  Personal life and character   Appearance  Tesla was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 142 pounds , with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. His appearance was described by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane as almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly . He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities, an appearance he maintained so as to further his business relationships. He was also described as having light eyes, very big hands , and remarkably big thumbs.  Eidetic memory  Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. Blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail. Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.  Relationships  Tesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This new woman was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, In place of the soft voiced, a gentlewoman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me. Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work. Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force . His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul . Tesla's friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink .Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. Twain notably described Tesla's induction motor invention as the most valuable patent since the telephone . At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight. He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress. When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life: He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.  Sleep habits  Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night. However, he did admit to dozing from time to time to recharge his batteries . During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... Tesla spoke animatedly, with pauses, as he ... work ed out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.  Work and dining habits  Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Tesla then telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla then resumed his work, often until 3:00 a.m. For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles per day. He curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, Suppose I made up my mind to murder you, he said, In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this? In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.  Views and beliefs   On experimental and theoretical physics  Tesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or sub atom that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Tesla believed that atoms are immutable they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. He was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying: I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view. In 1935 he described relativity as a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king and said his own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty time the speed of light.Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a dynamic theory of gravity that would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space . He stated that the theory was worked out in all details and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.  On society  Tesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook. This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics. Tesla expressed the belief that human pity had come to interfere with the natural ruthless workings of nature . Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a master race or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated: ... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal. In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by Queen Bees . He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post World War I environment in a printed article entitled Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War . Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.  On religion  Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a believer in the orthodox sense , said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance. He also said To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end and what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.  Literary works Tesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals. Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla , compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers. Many of Tesla's writings are freely available online, including the article The Problem of Increasing Human Energy , published in The Century Magazine in 1900, and the article Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency , published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.  Legacy and honors  Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.

            "text": "2244 Tesla, provisional designation 1952 UW1, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 25 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 22 October 1952, by Serbian astronomer Milorad Proti at the Belgrade Observatory, then Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, now Serbia. It is named after the inventor Nikola Tesla.  Orbit Tesla orbits the Sun in the central main belt at a distance of 2.3 3.3 AU once every 4 years and 9 months . Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 8 with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as 1938 UE1 at Turku Observatory in 1938, extending the body's observation arc by 14 years prior to its official discovery at Belgrade.  Physical characteristics In the SMASS taxonomy, Tesla is a dark C type asteroid. According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Tesla measures 24.37 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of 0.050, in correspondence with its carbonaceous composition. A larger diameter estimate of 29 kilometers was obtained in 2008, from an asteroid occultation.  Lightcurves  As of 2017, Tesla's rotation period and shape remains unknown.  Naming This minor planet was named in memory of Serbian American electrical engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla . He is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current electricity supply system. The lunar crater Tesla is also named in his honor. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 7 March 1985 .

            "text": "Houston Street is a major east west thoroughfare in Lower Manhattan in New York City. It runs the full width of the island of Manhattan, from FDR Drive along the East River in the east to the West Side Highway along the Hudson River in the west. The street is divided into west and east sections by Broadway. Houston Street generally serves as the boundary between neighborhoods on the East Side of Manhattan Alphabet City, the East Village, NoHo, Greenwich Village, and the West Village to the north, and the Lower East Side, most of the Bowery, Nolita, and SoHo to the south. The numeric street naming grid in Manhattan, created as part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, begins immediately north of Houston Street with 1st Street at Avenue A.The street's name is pronounced HOW st n , in contrast to the city of Houston, Texas, whose name is pronounced HYOO st n . The street was named for William Houstoun, while the city was named for Sam Houston.  Description  At its east end, Houston Street meets FDR Drive in an interchange at East River Park. West of FDR Drive, it intersects with Avenue D. Further west, other streets, including First Avenue, the Bowery, Lafayette Street and Broadway, intersect Houston Street. The Broadway intersection is the division point between East Houston Street and West Houston Street. Sixth Avenue intersects Houston Street at a curve in the road in Greenwich Village. East of Sixth Avenue, Houston street is bidirectional and separated by a median; west of Sixth, the street is narrower and unidirectional westbound. West Houston Street terminates at an intersection with West Street near Pier 40 on the Hudson River.  History  Houston Street is named for William Houstoun, who was a delegate from the state of Georgia to the Continental Congress from 1784 through 1786 and to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The street was christened by Nicholas Bayard , whose daughter, Mary, was married to Houstoun in 1788. The couple met while Houstoun, a member of an ancient and aristocratic Scottish family, was serving in the Congress. Bayard cut the street through a tract he owned in the vicinity of Canal Street in which he lived, and the city later extended it to include North Street, the northern border of New York's east side at the beginning of the 19th century.The current spelling of the name is a corruption: the street appears as Houstoun in the city's Common Council minutes for 1808 and the official map drawn in 1811 to establish the street grid that is still current. In those years, the Texas hero Sam Houston, for whom the street is sometimes incorrectly said to have been named, was an unknown teenager in Tennessee. Also mistaken is the explanation that the name derives from the Dutch words huis for house and tuin for garden. The narrow, westernmost stretch of the current Houston Street, from Sixth Avenue to the West Side Highway, was known as Hammersley Street until the middle 19th century, and was inside Greenwich Village. It later came to be regarded as the Village's southern boundary. In 1891, Nikola Tesla established his laboratory on Houston Street. Much of Tesla's research was lost in an 1895 fire. The street, originally narrow, was markedly widened from Sixth Avenue to Essex Street in the early 1930s during construction of the Independent Subway System's Sixth Avenue Line. The street widening involved demolition of buildings on both sides of the street, resulting in numerous small, empty lots. Although some of these lots have been redeveloped, many of them are now used by vendors, and some have been turned into playgrounds and, more recently, community gardens. Lower Manhattan's SoHo district takes its name from an acronym for South of Houston , as the street serves as SoHo's northern boundary; another, narrower neighborhood north of Houston Street is correspondingly called NoHo. In 1971, Houston Street became the southernmost street in Manhattan to extend between both the Hudson and East Rivers, when the World Trade Center was constructed and deprived Fulton Street of that title. With the reconstruction of the World Trade Center, Fulton Street was extended past Church Street to West Street, but is closed off to vehicular traffic west of Church Street.A reconstruction project rebuilt parts of the street between 2005 and 2018.  Transportation As of 2010, Houston Street is served by the M21 New York City Bus route from the FDR Drive to Washington Street. The bus route itself had replaced an earlier streetcar line, which is now the M9 from Avenues A to C. A portion of the New York City Subway's IND Sixth Avenue Line runs under Houston Street, between Sixth Avenue to just before Avenue A; there are stations at Second Avenue and Broadway Lafayette Street . Additionally, there is a station at Seventh Avenue, for the Houston Street . The Bleecker Street station has station entrances on the north side of Houston Street, due to its connection with the Broadway Lafayette Street station as part of a larger station complex. Exit 5 on the FDR Drive is on Houston Street. The street also connects directly with the West Side Highway; however, by then, Houston Street is westbound only.

            "text": "Benjamin Garver Lamme was an American electrical engineer and chief engineer at Westinghouse, where he was responsible for the design of electrical power machines. Lamme created an efficient induction motor from Nikola Tesla's patents and went on to design the giant Niagara Falls generators and motors and the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City.  Biography Lamme was born on a farm near Springfield, Ohio, on 12 January 1864. From an early age he tinkered with machinery and made experiments of his ideas on the Lamme family farm. He liked things that rotated, especially at high speed. In later years he was able to solve complex problems in his engineering work using mental calculations. Lamme graduated from Olive Branch High School near New Carlisle, Ohio in 1883 and subsequently entered Ohio State University and graduated with an engineering degree in 1888. In early 1889, Lamme read an article about Westinghouse forming the Philadelphia Natural Gas Company of Pittsburgh. Westinghouse hired Lamme and within a few months transferred him to the Westinghouse Electric Company. Lamme took over the stalled project of developing a practical version of Nikola Tesla's patented induction motor from Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and came up with a more efficient cage winding design. Over a period of several years, he designed a variety of electrical motors and generators. Among his eight US patents were inventions on induction motors, electrical ship propulsion, and Gyroscopic stabilizer systems. He designed the single reduction motor for street railways , the Rotary Converter, railroad electrification systems, the Westinghouse Type C Induction Motor, and the first 5000 kW generators for the giant hydroelectric generators in the Adams Power Plant at Niagara Falls, for many years the largest power station in the world. Bertha Lamme Feicht worked alongside her brother in the design of the turbogenerator at Niagara Falls. Operation began locally in 1895 and power was transmitted to Buffalo, New York, in 1896.Lamme spent many years developing advanced analysis and computational methods for designing and predicting the performance of electrical machines, doing much of the work at night because he had other duties assigned to him during the day. Among other available employees, no one else seemed able to do the computational work, so Bertha, who like her brother Benjamin had an engineering degree from Ohio State University, was recruited to aid with the computation. After a few years, she left Westinghouse to get married. The importance of Lamme's methodology was realized in 1893 when Westinghouse began designing the first Niagara Falls 5000 kW generators. Lamme designed much of the apparatus for the Westinghouse exhibit at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, including alternating current generators, induction motors, and rotary converters. In addition to his design work on the Niagara Falls alternators, Lamme designed the monster machines for the power plant of the Manhattan Elevated Railway in New York City. Lamme became chief engineer at Westinghouse in 1903 and held the position for the rest of his life. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway adopted the Lamme s single phase electric rail system in 1905. In 1915, Lamme was nominated by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy to represent the AIEE on the Naval Consulting Board.Lamme died July 8, 1924 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the age of 60. In his will, he established the AIEE Lamme Medal to recognize members of the AIEE for 'meritorious achievement in the development of electrical apparatus or machinery.' His will also provided for a gold medal to be awarded by the American Society for Engineering Education for accomplishment in technical teaching.  Career As technology advanced, one of Mr. Lamme s responsibilities was to recruit, evaluate, and train new engineering graduates employed by the Westinghouse Company. He developed criteria for selecting the most talented persons for the design engineering work. He developed and taught the Westinghouse Engineering Course in which those selected spent full time for six months. Lamme s great interest in the people with whom he worked was returned by their affection, esteem and admiration for him as a great engineer. He was addressed by his friends and colleagues as well as his family by the affectionate B.G. Lamme was very fond of classical music and accumulated a large collection of records.  Awards Lamme received the IEEE Edison Medal on May 16, 1919, in the Auditorium of the Engineering Societies Building the site that preceded the United Engineering Building of recent times in New York City. The citation was For Invention and Development of Electrical Machinery. The Edison Medal is presented for a career of meritorious achievements in electrical science or electrical engineering or electrical arts. On January 12, 1923 Ohio State University presented Mr. Lamme with the Joseph Sullivant Medal; the initial presentation of that award.He received the 1918 AIEE Edison Medal for his contributions to the electrical power field.  Personal life Lamme never married and made his home with his sisters. His sister and fellow Ohio State graduate, Bertha Lamme Feicht was the nation s first woman electrical engineer and the first woman who graduated in a major field of engineering other than areas related to civil engineering. She worked at Westinghouse as an electrical design engineer under her brother s direction until her marriage to fellow Westinghouse engineer, Russel Feicht. Bertha worked on the turbogenerator for the Niagara Falls project. In his will he also provided that a gold medal be presented annually to a technical graduate of his alma mater, Ohio State University, for meritorious achievement in engineering.

            "text": "An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc . The carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for most of these purposes, but it is still used as a source of high intensity ultraviolet light. The term is now used for gas discharge lamps, which produce light by an arc between metal electrodes through a gas in a glass bulb. The common fluorescent lamp is a low pressure mercury arc lamp. The xenon arc lamp, which produces a high intensity white light, is now used in many of the applications which formerly used the carbon arc, such as movie projectors and searchlights.  Operation An arc is the discharge that occurs when a gas is ionized. A high voltage is pulsed across the lamp to ignite or strike the arc, after which the discharge can be maintained at a lower voltage. The strike requires an electrical circuit with an igniter and a ballast. The ballast is wired in series with the lamp and performs two functions. First, when the power is first switched on, the igniter starter sets up a small current through the ballast and starter. This creates a small magnetic field within the ballast windings. A moment later the starter interrupts the current flow from the ballast, which has a high inductance and therefore tries to maintain the current flow ; it cannot, as there is no longer a 'circuit'. As a result, a high voltage appears across the ballast momentarily, to which the lamp is connected; therefore the lamp receives this high voltage across it which 'strikes' the arc within the tube lamp. The circuit will repeat this action until the lamp is ionized enough to sustain the arc. When the lamp sustains the arc, the ballast performs its second function, to limit the current to that needed to operate the lamp. The lamp, ballast and igniter are rating matched to each other; these parts must be replaced with the same rating as the failed component or the lamp will not work. The colour of the light emitted by the lamp changes as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Lightning is a similar principle where the atmosphere is ionized by the high potential difference between earth and storm clouds. The temperature of the arc in an arc lamp can reach several thousand degrees Celsius. The outer glass envelope can reach 500 degrees Celsius, therefore before servicing one must ensure the bulb has cooled sufficiently to handle. Often, if these types of lamps are turned off or lose their power supply, one cannot restrike the lamp again for several minutes . However, some lamps can be restruck as soon as they are turned off . The Vortek water wall plasma arc lamp, invented in 1975 by David Camm and Roy Nodwell at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, made the Guinness Book of World Records in 1986 and 1993 as the most powerful continuously burning light source at over 300 kW or 1.2 million candle power.  Carbon arc lamp  In popular use, the term arc lamp means carbon arc lamp only. In a carbon arc lamp, the electrodes are carbon rods in free air. To ignite the lamp, the rods are touched together, thus allowing a relatively low voltage to strike the arc. The rods are then slowly drawn apart, and electric current heats and maintains an arc across the gap. The tips of the carbon rods are heated and the carbon vaporizes. The carbon vapor in the arc is highly luminous, which is what produces the bright light. The rods are slowly burnt away in use, and the distance between them needs to be regularly adjusted in order to maintain the arc.Many ingenious mechanisms were invented to affect the distance automatically, mostly based on solenoids. In one of the simplest mechanically regulated forms the electrodes are mounted vertically. The current supplying the arc is passed in series through a solenoid attached to the top electrode. If the points of the electrodes are touching the resistance falls, the current increases and the increased pull from the solenoid draws the points apart. If the arc starts to fail the current drops and the points close up again. The Yablochkov candle is a simple arc lamp without a regulator, but it has the drawbacks that the arc cannot be restarted and a limited lifetime of only a few hours.  History The concept of carbon arc lighting was first demonstrated by Humphry Davy in the early 19th century, but sources disagree about the year he first demonstrated it; 1802, 1805, 1807 and 1809 are all mentioned. Davy used charcoal sticks and a two thousand cell battery to create an arc across a 4 inch gap. He mounted his electrodes horizontally and noted that, because of the strong convection flow of air, the arc formed the shape of an arch. He coined the term arch lamp , which was contracted to arc lamp when the devices came into common usage.In the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for The Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers . Her paper was The Hissing of the Electric Arc .The arc lamp provided one of the first commercial uses for electricity, a phenomenon previously confined to experiment, the telegraph, and entertainment.  Carbon arc lighting in the U.S.  In the United States, there were attempts to produce arc lamps commercially after 1850, but the lack of a constant electricity supply thwarted efforts. Thus electrical engineers began focusing on the problem of improving Faraday's dynamo. The concept was improved upon by a number of people including William Edwards Staite and Charles F. Brush. It was not until the 1870s that lamps such as the Yablochkov candle were more commonly seen. In 1877, the Franklin Institute conducted a comparative test of dynamo systems. The one developed by Brush performed best, and Brush immediately applied his improved dynamo to arc lighting, an early application being Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 29, 1879. Despite this, Wabash, Indiana claims to be the first city ever to be lit with Brush Lights . Four of these lights became active there on March 31, 1880. Wabash, IN Wabash was a small enough city to be lit entirely by 4 lights, whereas the installation at Cleveland's Public Square only lit a portion of that larger city. Brush Lights, Cleveland In 1880, Brush established the Brush Electric Company. The harsh and brilliant light was found most suitable for public areas, such as Cleveland's Public Square, being around 200 times more powerful than contemporary filament lamps. The usage of Brush electric arc lights spread quickly. Scientific American reported in 1881 that the system was being used in: 800 lights in rolling mills, steel works, shops, 1,240 lights in woolen, cotton, linen, silk, and other factories, 425 lights in large stores, hotels, churches, 250 lights in parks, docks, and summer resorts, 275 lights in railroad depots and shops, 130 lights in mines, smelting works, 380 lights in factories and establishments of various kinds, 1,500 lights in lighting stations, for city lighting, 1,200 lights in England and other foreign countries. A total of over 6,000 lights which are actually sold. There were three major advances in the 1880s: Franti ek K i k invented in 1880 a mechanism to allow the automatic adjustment of the electrodes. The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption . Flame arc lamps were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts added to increase light output and produce different colours. In the U.S., patent protection of arc lighting systems and improved dynamos proved difficult and as a result the arc lighting industry became highly competitive. Brush's principal competition was from the team of Elihu Thomson and Edwin J. Houston. These two had formed the American Electric Corporation in 1880, but it was soon bought up by Charles A. Coffin, moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, and renamed the Thomson Houston Electric Company. Thomson remained, though, the principal inventive genius behind the company patenting improvements to the lighting system. Under the leadership of Thomson Houston's patent attorney, Frederick P. Fish, the company protected its new patent rights. Coffin's management also led the company towards an aggressive policy of buy outs and mergers with competitors. Both strategies reduced competition in the electrical lighting manufacturing industry. By 1890, the Thomson Houston company was the dominant electrical manufacturing company in the U.S. Nikola Tesla received U.S. Patent 447920, Method of Operating Arc Lamps , that describes a 10,000 cycles per second alternator to suppress the disagreeable sound of power frequency harmonics produced by arc lamps operating on frequencies within the range of human hearing. Around the turn of the century arc lighting systems were in decline, but Thomson Houston controlled key patents to urban lighting systems. This control slowed the expansion of incandescent lighting systems being developed by Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company. Conversely, Edison's control of direct current distribution and generating machinery patents blocked further expansion of Thomson Houston. The roadblock to expansion was removed when the two companies merged in 1892 to form the General Electric Company.Arc lamps were used in some early motion picture studios to illuminate interior shots. One problem was that they produce such a high level of ultra violet light that many actors needed to wear sunglasses when off camera to relieve sore eyes resulting from the ultra violet light. The problem was solved by adding a sheet of ordinary window glass in front of the lamp, blocking the ultra violet. By the dawn of the talkies , arc lamps had been replaced in film studios with other types of lights. In 1915, Elmer Ambrose Sperry began manufacturing his invention of a high intensity carbon arc searchlight. These were used aboard warships of all navies during the 20th century for signaling and illuminating enemies. In the 1920s, carbon arc lamps were sold as family health products, a substitute for natural sunlight.Arc lamps were superseded by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche applications such as cinema projection, spotlights, and searchlights. Even in these applications conventional carbon arc lamps are being pushed into obsolescence by xenon arc lamps, but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured for at least one purpose simulating sunlight in accelerated aging machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.The practice of shipping and projecting motion pictures on 2,000 foot reels, and employing changeovers between two projectors, was due to the carbon rods used in projector lamphouses having a lifespan of roughly 22 minutes . The projectionist would replace the carbon rod when changing film reels. The two projector changeover setup largely disappeared in the 1970s with the advent of xenon projector lamps, being replaced with single projector platter systems, though films would continue to be shipped to cinemas on 2,000 foot reels.

            "text": "Wireless power transfer , wireless power transmission, wireless energy transmission , or electromagnetic power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power from a power source, generates a time varying electromagnetic field, which transmits power across space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load. The technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thus increasing the mobility, convenience, and safety of an electronic device for all users. Wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible. Wireless power techniques mainly fall into two categories, near field and far field. In near field or non radiative techniques, power is transferred over short distances by magnetic fields using inductive coupling between coils of wire, or by electric fields using capacitive coupling between metal electrodes. Inductive coupling is the most widely used wireless technology; its applications include charging handheld devices like phones and electric toothbrushes, RFID tags, induction cooking, and wirelessly charging or continuous wireless power transfer in implantable medical devices like artificial cardiac pacemakers, or electric vehicles. In far field or radiative techniques, also called power beaming, power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation, like microwaves or laser beams. These techniques can transport energy longer distances but must be aimed at the receiver. Proposed applications for this type include solar power satellites and wireless powered drone aircraft.An important issue associated with all wireless power systems is limiting the exposure of people and other living beings to potentially injurious electromagnetic fields.  Overview  Wireless power transfer is a generic term for a number of different technologies for transmitting energy by means of electromagnetic fields. The technologies, listed in the table below, differ in the distance over which they can transfer power efficiently, whether the transmitter must be aimed at the receiver, and in the type of electromagnetic energy they use: time varying electric fields, magnetic fields, radio waves, microwaves, infrared or visible light waves.In general a wireless power system consists of a transmitter device connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, which converts the power to a time varying electromagnetic field, and one or more receiver devices which receive the power and convert it back to DC or AC electric current which is used by an electrical load. At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating electromagnetic field by some type of antenna device. The word antenna is used loosely here; it may be a coil of wire which generates a magnetic field, a metal plate which generates an electric field, an antenna which radiates radio waves, or a laser which generates light. A similar antenna or coupling device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current. An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the frequency, which determines the wavelength. Wireless power uses the same fields and waves as wireless communication devices like radio, another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in cellphones, radio and television broadcasting, and WiFi. In radio communication the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, as long as it is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly. In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver. In contrast, with wireless power transfer the amount of energy received is the important thing, so the efficiency is the more significant parameter. For this reason, wireless power technologies are likely to be more limited by distance than wireless communication technologies. Wireless power transfer may be used to power up wireless information transmitters or receivers. This type of communication is known as wireless powered communication . When the harvested power is used to supply the power of wireless information transmitters, the network is known as Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer ; whereas when it is used to supply the power of wireless information receivers, it is known as a Wireless Powered Communication Network .These are the different wireless power technologies:  Field regions Electric and magnetic fields are created by charged particles in matter such as electrons. A stationary charge creates an electrostatic field in the space around it. A steady current of charges creates a static magnetic field around it. The above fields contain energy, but cannot carry power because they are static. However time varying fields can carry power. Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an alternating current of electrons in a wire, create time varying electric and magnetic fields in the space around them. These fields can exert oscillating forces on the electrons in a receiving antenna , causing them to move back and forth. These represent alternating current which can be used to power a load. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields surrounding moving electric charges in an antenna device can be divided into two regions, depending on distance Drange from the antenna. The boundary between the regions is somewhat vaguely defined. The fields have different characteristics in these regions, and different technologies are used for transferring power: Near field or nonradiative region This means the area within about 1 wavelength of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and power can be transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling between coils of wire. These fields are not radiative, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no receiving device or absorbing material within their limited range to couple to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on the size and shape of the antenna devices, which are usually coils of wire. The fields, and thus the power transmitted, decrease exponentially with distance, so if the distance between the two antennas Drange is much larger than the diameter of the antennas Dant very little power will be received. Therefore, these techniques cannot be used for long range power transmission.Resonance, such as resonant inductive coupling, can increase the coupling between the antennas greatly, allowing efficient transmission at somewhat greater distances, although the fields still decrease exponentially. Therefore the range of near field devices is conventionally divided into two categories: Short range up to about one antenna diameter: Drange Dant. This is the range over which ordinary nonresonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power. Mid range up to 10 times the antenna diameter: Drange 10 Dant. This is the range over which resonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power.Far field or radiative region Beyond about 1 wavelength of the antenna, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna whether or not there is a receiver to absorb it. The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves , which is determined by the frequency:  c f. At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant  , very little power is radiated. Therefore the near field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. Antennas about the same size as the wavelength Dant  such as monopole or dipole antennas, radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions , so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it. Therefore, these can be used for short range, inefficient power transmission but not for long range transmission.However, unlike fields, electromagnetic radiation can be focused by reflection or refraction into beams. By using a high gain antenna or optical system which concentrates the radiation into a narrow beam aimed at the receiver, it can be used for long range power transmission. From the Rayleigh criterion, to produce the narrow beams necessary to focus a significant amount of the energy on a distant receiver, an antenna must be much larger than the wavelength of the waves used: Dant  c f. Practical beam power devices require wavelengths in the centimeter region or below, corresponding to frequencies above 1 GHz, in the microwave range or above.  Near field techniques At large relative distance, the near field components of electric and magnetic fields are approximately quasi static oscillating dipole fields. These fields decrease with the cube of distance: 3 Since power is proportional to the square of the field strength, the power transferred decreases as 6. or 60 dB per decade. In other words, if far apart, doubling the distance between the two antennas causes the power received to decrease by a factor of 26 64. As a result, inductive and capacitive coupling can only be used for short range power transfer, within a few times the diameter of the antenna device Dant. Unlike in a radiative system where the maximum radiation occurs when the dipole antennas are oriented transverse to the direction of propagation, with dipole fields the maximum coupling occurs when the dipoles are oriented longitudinally.  Inductive coupling  In inductive coupling , power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. The transmitter and receiver coils together form a transformer . An alternating current through the transmitter coil creates an oscillating magnetic field by Ampere's law. The magnetic field passes through the receiving coil , where it induces an alternating EMF by Faraday's law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at 50 60 Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.Inductive coupling is the oldest and most widely used wireless power technology, and virtually the only one so far which is used in commercial products. It is used in inductive charging stands for cordless appliances used in wet environments such as electric toothbrushes and shavers, to reduce the risk of electric shock. Another application area is transcutaneous recharging of biomedical prosthetic devices implanted in the human body, such as cardiac pacemakers and insulin pumps, to avoid having wires passing through the skin. It is also used to charge electric vehicles such as cars and to either charge or power transit vehicles like buses and trains.However the fastest growing use is wireless charging pads to recharge mobile and handheld wireless devices such as laptop and tablet computers, computer mouse, cellphones, digital media players, and video game controllers. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission provided its first certification for a wireless transmission charging system in December 2017.The power transferred increases with frequency and the mutual inductance       M     displaystyle M  between the coils, which depends on their geometry and the distance         D      range          displaystyle D text range  between them. A widely used figure of merit is the coupling coefficient       k          M                    L        1              L        2                 displaystyle k ; ;M sqrt L 1 L 2  . This dimensionless parameter is equal to the fraction of magnetic flux through the transmitter coil       L   1     displaystyle L1  that passes through the receiver coil       L   2     displaystyle L2  when L2 is open circuited. If the two coils are on the same axis and close together so all the magnetic flux from       L   1     displaystyle L1  passes through       L   2     displaystyle L2 ,       k     1     displaystyle k 1  and the link efficiency approaches 100 . The greater the separation between the coils, the more of the magnetic field from the first coil misses the second, and the lower       k     displaystyle k  and the link efficiency are, approaching zero at large separations. The link efficiency and power transferred is roughly proportional to         k      2          displaystyle k 2  . In order to achieve high efficiency, the coils must be very close together, a fraction of the coil diameter         D      ant          displaystyle D text ant  , usually within centimeters, with the coils' axes aligned. Wide, flat coil shapes are usually used, to increase coupling. Ferrite flux confinement cores can confine the magnetic fields, improving coupling and reducing interference to nearby electronics, but they are heavy and bulky so small wireless devices often use air core coils. Ordinary inductive coupling can only achieve high efficiency when the coils are very close together, usually adjacent. In most modern inductive systems resonant inductive coupling is used, in which the efficiency is increased by using resonant circuits. This can achieve high efficiencies at greater distances than nonresonant inductive coupling.   Resonant inductive coupling  Resonant inductive coupling is a form of inductive coupling in which power is transferred by magnetic fields between two resonant circuits , one in the transmitter and one in the receiver . Each resonant circuit consists of a coil of wire connected to a capacitor, or a self resonant coil or other resonator with internal capacitance. The two are tuned to resonate at the same resonant frequency. The resonance between the coils can greatly increase coupling and power transfer, analogously to the way a vibrating tuning fork can induce sympathetic vibration in a distant fork tuned to the same pitch. Nikola Tesla first discovered resonant coupling during his pioneering experiments in wireless power transfer around the turn of the 20th century, but the possibilities of using resonant coupling to increase transmission range has only recently been explored. In 2007 a team led by Marin Solja i at MIT used two coupled tuned circuits each made of a 25 cm self resonant coil of wire at 10 MHz to achieve the transmission of 60 W of power over a distance of 2 meters  at around 40 efficiency.The concept behind resonant inductive coupling systems is that high Q factor resonators exchange energy at a much higher rate than they lose energy due to internal damping. Therefore, by using resonance, the same amount of power can be transferred at greater distances, using the much weaker magnetic fields out in the peripheral regions of the near fields. Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter . This is called mid range transfer, in contrast to the short range of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent. Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.A drawback of resonant coupling theory is that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency of the system is no longer constant but splits into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak.Resonant technology is currently being widely incorporated in modern inductive wireless power systems. One of the possibilities envisioned for this technology is area wireless power coverage. A coil in the wall or ceiling of a room might be able to wirelessly power lights and mobile devices anywhere in the room, with reasonable efficiency. An environmental and economic benefit of wirelessly powering small devices such as clocks, radios, music players and remote controls is that it could drastically reduce the 6 billion batteries disposed of each year, a large source of toxic waste and groundwater contamination.  Capacitive coupling  Capacitive coupling also referred to as electric coupling, makes use of electric fields for the transmission of power between two electrodes forming a capacitance for the transfer of power. In capacitive coupling , the conjugate of inductive coupling, energy is transmitted by electric fields between electrodes such as metal plates. The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric. An alternating voltage generated by the transmitter is applied to the transmitting plate, and the oscillating electric field induces an alternating potential on the receiver plate by electrostatic induction, which causes an alternating current to flow in the load circuit. The amount of power transferred increases with the frequency the square of the voltage, and the capacitance between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and inversely proportional to the separation. Capacitive coupling has only been used practically in a few low power applications, because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous, and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious ozone production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to dielectric polarization. Intervening materials between or near the electrodes can absorb the energy, in the case of humans possibly causing excessive electromagnetic field exposure. However capacitive coupling has a few advantages over inductive coupling. The field is largely confined between the capacitor plates, reducing interference, which in inductive coupling requires heavy ferrite flux confinement cores. Also, alignment requirements between the transmitter and receiver are less critical. Capacitive coupling has recently been applied to charging battery powered portable devices as well as charging or continuous wireless power transfer in biomedical implants, and is being considered as a means of transferring power between substrate layers in integrated circuits.Two types of circuit have been used: Transverse design: In this type of circuit, there are two transmitter plates and two receiver plates. Each transmitter plate is coupled to a receiver plate. The transmitter oscillator drives the transmitter plates in opposite phase by a high alternating voltage, and the load is connected between the two receiver plates. The alternating electric fields induce opposite phase alternating potentials in the receiver plates, and this push pull action causes current to flow back and forth between the plates through the load. A disadvantage of this configuration for wireless charging is that the two plates in the receiving device must be aligned face to face with the charger plates for the device to work. Longitudinal design: In this type of circuit, the transmitter and receiver have only one active electrode, and either the ground or a large passive electrode serves as the return path for the current. The transmitter oscillator is connected between an active and a passive electrode. The load is also connected between an active and a passive electrode. The electric field produced by the transmitter induces alternating charge displacement in the load dipole through electrostatic induction.  Resonant capacitive coupling  Resonance can also be used with capacitive coupling to extend the range. At the turn of the 20th century, Nikola Tesla did the first experiments with both resonant inductive and capacitive coupling.  Electrodynamic Wireless Power Transfer  An electrodynamic wireless power transfer system utilizes a receiver with a mechanically resonating or rotating permanent magnet. When subjected to a time varying magnetic field, the mechanical motion of the resonating magnet is converted into electricity by one or more electromechanical transduction schemes . Compared to other WPT schemes, EWPT leverages low frequency magnetic fields , which safely pass through conductive media and have higher human field exposure limits , showing promise for potential use in wirelessly recharging biomedical implants. For EWPT devices having identical resonant frequencies, the magnitude of power transfer is entirely dependent on critical coupling coefficient, denoted by       k     displaystyle k , between the transmitter and receiver devices. For coupled resonators with same resonant frequencies, wireless power transfer between the transmitter and the receiver is spread over three regimes under coupled, critically coupled and over coupled regimes. As the critical coupling coefficient increases from an under coupled regime to the critical coupled regime, the optimum voltage gain curve grows in magnitude and peaks when       k        k      c    r    i    t          displaystyle k k crit  and then enters into the over coupled regime where       k        k      c    r    i    t          displaystyle k k crit  and the peak splits into two. This critical coupling coefficient is demonstrated to be a function of distance between the source and the receiver devices.  Magnetodynamic coupling  In this method, power is transmitted between two rotating armatures, one in the transmitter and one in the receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets on the armatures. The transmitter armature is turned either by or as the rotor of an electric motor, and its magnetic field exerts torque on the receiver armature, turning it. The magnetic field acts like a mechanical coupling between the armatures. The receiver armature produces power to drive the load, either by turning a separate electric generator or by using the receiver armature itself as the rotor in a generator. This device has been proposed as an alternative to inductive power transfer for noncontact charging of electric vehicles. A rotating armature embedded in a garage floor or curb would turn a receiver armature in the underside of the vehicle to charge its batteries. It is claimed that this technique can transfer power over distances of 10 to 15 cm with high efficiency, over 90 . Also, the low frequency stray magnetic fields produced by the rotating magnets produce less electromagnetic interference to nearby electronic devices than the high frequency magnetic fields produced by inductive coupling systems. A prototype system charging electric vehicles has been in operation at University of British Columbia since 2012. Other researchers, however, claim that the two energy conversions make the system less efficient than electrical systems like inductive coupling.  Zenneck Wave Transmission  A new kind of system using the Zenneck type waves was shown by Oruganti et al., where they demonstrated that it was possible to excite Zenneck wave type waves on flat metal air interfaces and transmit power across metal obstacles. Here the idea is to excite a localized charge oscillation at the metal air interface, the resulting modes propagate along the metal air interface.  Far field techniques Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often multiple kilometer ranges, where the distance is much greater than the diameter of the device . High directivity antennas or well collimated laser light produce a beam of energy that can be made to match the shape of the receiving area. The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction. In general, visible light and microwaves are the forms of electromagnetic radiation best suited to energy transfer. The dimensions of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths ; so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one. The Rayleigh limit , although originally applied to image resolution, can be viewed in reverse, and dictates that the irradiance of any electromagnetic wave will be reduced as the beam diverges over distance at a minimum rate inversely proportional to the aperture size. The larger the ratio of a transmitting antenna's aperture or laser's exit aperture to the wavelength of radiation, the more can the radiation be concentrated in a compact beam Microwave power beaming can be more efficient than lasers, and is less prone to atmospheric attenuation caused by dust or aerosols such as fog. Here, the power levels are calculated by combining the above parameters together, and adding in the gains and losses due to the antenna characteristics and the transparency and dispersion of the medium through which the radiation passes. That process is known as calculating a link budget.  Microwaves  Power transmission via radio waves can be made more directional, allowing longer distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A rectenna may be used to convert the microwave energy back into electricity. Rectenna conversion efficiencies exceeding 95 have been realized. Power beaming using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the beaming of power to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.Power beaming by microwaves has the difficulty that, for most space applications, the required aperture sizes are very large due to diffraction limiting antenna directionality. For example, the 1978 NASA study of solar power satellites required a 1 kilometre diameter transmitting antenna and a 10 kilometre diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at 2.45 GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although short wavelengths may have difficulties with atmospheric absorption and beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse , it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. For earthbound applications, a large area 10 km diameter receiving array allows large total power levels to be used while operating at the low power density suggested for human electromagnetic exposure safety. A human safe power density of 1 mW cm2 distributed across a 10 km diameter area corresponds to 750 megawatts total power level. This is the power level found in many modern electric power plants. For comparison, a solar PV farm of similar size might easily exceed 10,000 megawatts at best conditions during daytime. Following World War II, which saw the development of high power microwave emitters known as cavity magnetrons, the idea of using microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.Japanese researcher Hidetsugu Yagi also investigated wireless energy transmission using a directional array antenna that he designed. In February 1926, Yagi and his colleague Shintaro Uda published their first paper on the tuned high gain directional array now known as the Yagi antenna. While it did not prove to be particularly useful for power transmission, this beam antenna has been widely adopted throughout the broadcasting and wireless telecommunications industries due to its excellent performance characteristics.Wireless high power transmission using microwaves is well proven. Experiments in the tens of kilowatts have been performed at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California in 1975 and more recently at Grand Bassin on Reunion Island. These methods achieve distances on the order of a kilometer. Under experimental conditions, microwave conversion efficiency was measured to be around 54 across one meter.A change to 24 GHz has been suggested as microwave emitters similar to LEDs have been made with very high quantum efficiencies using negative resistance, i.e., Gunn or IMPATT diodes, and this would be viable for short range links. In 2013, inventor Hatem Zeine demonstrated how wireless power transmission using phased array antennas can deliver electrical power up to 30 feet. It uses the same radio frequencies as WiFi.In 2015, researchers at the University of Washington introduced power over Wi Fi, which trickle charges batteries and powered battery free cameras and temperature sensors using transmissions from Wi Fi routers. Wi Fi signals were shown to power battery free temperature and camera sensors at ranges of up to 20 feet. It was also shown that Wi Fi can be used to wirelessly trickle charge nickel metal hydride and lithium ion coin cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet. In 2017, the Federal Communication Commission certified the first mid field radio frequency transmitter of wireless power. In 2021 the FCC granted a license to a over the air wireless charging system that combines near field and far field methods by using a frequency of about 900 MHz. Due to the radiated power of about 1 W this system is intended for small IoT devices as various sensors, trackers, detectors and monitors.  Lasers  In the case of electromagnetic radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum , power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is received and concentrated onto photovoltaic cells . This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.Advantages compared to other wireless methods are: Collimated monochromatic wavefront propagation allows narrow beam cross section area for transmission over large distances. As a result, there is little or no reduction in power when increasing the distance from the transmitter to the receiver. Compact size: solid state lasers fit into small products. No radio frequency interference to existing radio communication such as Wi Fi and cell phones. Access control: only receivers hit by the laser receive power.Drawbacks include: Laser radiation is hazardous. Without a proper safety mechanism, low power levels can blind humans and other animals. High power levels can kill through localized spot heating. Conversion between electricity and light is limited. Photovoltaic cells achieve a maximum of 40 50 efficiency. Atmospheric absorption, and absorption and scattering by clouds, fog, rain, etc., causes up to 100 losses. Requires a direct line of sight with the target. Laser 'powerbeaming' technology was explored in military weapons and aerospace applications. Also, it is applied for the powering of various kinds of sensors in industrial environments. Lately, it is developed for powering commercial and consumer electronics. Wireless energy transfer systems using lasers for consumer space have to satisfy laser safety requirements standardized under IEC 60825.The first wireless power system using lasers for consumer applications was demonstrated in 2018, capable of delivering power to stationary and moving devices across a room. This wireless power system complies with safety regulations according to IEC 60825 standard. It is also approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration .Other details include propagation, and the coherence and the range limitation problem.Geoffrey Landis is one of the pioneers of solar power satellites and laser based transfer of energy, especially for space and lunar missions. The demand for safe and frequent space missions has resulted in proposals for a laser powered space elevator.NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center has demonstrated a lightweight unmanned model plane powered by a laser beam. This proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of periodic recharging using a laser beam system. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a proof of concept of utilizing a dual wavelength laser to wirelessly charge portable devices or UAVs.  Atmospheric plasma channel coupling  In atmospheric plasma channel coupling, energy is transferred between two electrodes by electrical conduction through ionized air. When an electric field gradient exists between the two electrodes, exceeding 34 kilovolts per centimeter at sea level atmospheric pressure, an electric arc occurs. This atmospheric dielectric breakdown results in the flow of electric current along a random trajectory through an ionized plasma channel between the two electrodes. An example of this is natural lightning, where one electrode is a virtual point in a cloud and the other is a point on Earth. Laser Induced Plasma Channel research is presently underway using ultrafast lasers to artificially promote development of the plasma channel through the air, directing the electric arc, and guiding the current across a specific path in a controllable manner. The laser energy reduces the atmospheric dielectric breakdown voltage and the air is made less insulating by superheating, which lowers the density of the filament of air.This new process is being explored for use as a laser lightning rod and as a means to trigger lightning bolts from clouds for natural lightning channel studies, for artificial atmospheric propagation studies, as a substitute for conventional radio antennas, for applications associated with electric welding and machining, for diverting power from high voltage capacitor discharges, for directed energy weapon applications employing electrical conduction through a ground return path, and electronic jamming.  Energy harvesting  In the context of wireless power, energy harvesting, also called power harvesting or energy scavenging, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves from nearby electrical equipment, light, thermal energy , or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule , it can be adequate to run or recharge small micropower wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. This new technology is being developed to eliminate the need for battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.  History   19th century developments and dead ends  The 19th century saw many developments of theories, and counter theories on how electrical energy might be transmitted. In 1826, Andr Marie Amp re discovered a connection between current and magnets. Michael Faraday described in 1831 with his law of induction the electromotive force driving a current in a conductor loop by a time varying magnetic flux. Transmission of electrical energy without wires was observed by many inventors and experimenters, but lack of a coherent theory attributed these phenomena vaguely to electromagnetic induction. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell's equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the wireless carrier of electromagnetic energy. Around 1884 John Henry Poynting defined the Poynting vector and gave Poynting's theorem, which describe the flow of power across an area within electromagnetic radiation and allow for a correct analysis of wireless power transfer systems. This was followed on by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz' 1888 validation of the theory, which included the evidence for radio waves.During the same period two schemes of wireless signaling were put forward by William Henry Ward and Mahlon Loomis that were based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. Both inventors' patents noted this layer connected with a return path using Earth currents ' would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries, and could also be used for lighting, heat, and motive power. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.  Tesla  After 1890, inventor Nikola Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using spark excited radio frequency resonant transformers, now called Tesla coils, which generated high AC voltages. Early on he attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He found he could increase the distance at which he could light a lamp by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the transmitter's LC circuit. using resonant inductive coupling. Tesla failed to make a commercial product out of his findings but his resonant inductive coupling method is now widely used in electronics and is currently being applied to short range wireless power systems. Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would break the air stratum down , eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a World Wireless System that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.  Near field and non radiative technologies  Inductive power transfer between nearby wire coils was the earliest wireless power technology to be developed, existing since the transformer was developed in the 1800s. Induction heating has been used since the early 1900s and is used for induction cooking.With the advent of cordless devices, induction charging stands have been developed for appliances used in wet environments, like electric toothbrushes and electric razors, to eliminate the hazard of electric shock. One of the earliest proposed applications of inductive transfer was to power electric locomotives. In 1892 Maurice Hutin and Maurice Leblanc patented a wireless method of powering railroad trains using resonant coils inductively coupled to a track wire at 3 kHz.In the early 1960s resonant inductive wireless energy transfer was used successfully in implantable medical devices including such devices as pacemakers and artificial hearts. While the early systems used a resonant receiver coil, later systems implemented resonant transmitter coils as well. These medical devices are designed for high efficiency using low power electronics while efficiently accommodating some misalignment and dynamic twisting of the coils. The separation between the coils in implantable applications is commonly less than 20 cm. Today resonant inductive energy transfer is regularly used for providing electric power in many commercially available medical implantable devices.The first passive RFID technologies were invented by Mario Cardullo and Koelle et al. and by the 1990s were being used in proximity cards and contactless smartcards. The proliferation of portable wireless communication devices such as mobile phones, tablet, and laptop computers in recent decades is currently driving the development of mid range wireless powering and charging technology to eliminate the need for these devices to be tethered to wall plugs during charging. The Wireless Power Consortium was established in 2008 to develop interoperable standards across manufacturers. Its Qi inductive power standard published in August 2009 enables high efficiency charging and powering of portable devices of up to 5 watts over distances of 4 cm . The wireless device is placed on a flat charger plate and power is transferred from a flat coil in the charger to a similar one in the device. In 2007, a team led by Marin Solja i at MIT used a dual resonance transmitter with a 25 cm diameter secondary tuned to 10 MHz to transfer 60 W of power to a similar dual resonance receiver over a distance of 2 meters  at around 40 efficiency.In 2008 the team of Greg Leyh and Mike Kennan of Nevada Lightning Lab used a grounded dual resonance transmitter with a 57 cm diameter secondary tuned to 60 kHz and a similar grounded dual resonance receiver to transfer power through coupled electric fields with an earth current return circuit over a distance of 12 meters . In 2011, Dr. Christopher A. Tucker and Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading, recreated Tesla's 1900 patent 0,645,576 in miniature and demonstrated power transmission over 4 meters with a coil diameter of 10 centimetres at a resonant frequency of 27.50 MHz, with an effective efficiency of 60 .  Microwaves and lasers  Before World War II, little progress was made in wireless power transmission. Radio was developed for communication uses, but could not be used for power transmission since the relatively low frequency radio waves spread out in all directions and little energy reached the receiver. In radio communication, at the receiver, an amplifier intensifies a weak signal using energy from another source. For power transmission, efficient transmission required transmitters that could generate higher frequency microwaves, which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.The development of microwave technology during World War II, such as the klystron and magnetron tubes and parabolic antennas, made radiative methods practical for the first time, and the first long distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by William C. Brown. In 1964, Brown invented the rectenna which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground. A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 1980s was to develop a solar power satellite. Conceived in 1968 by Peter Glaser, this would harvest energy from sunlight using solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the electric power grid. In landmark 1975 experiments as technical director of a JPL Raytheon program, Brown demonstrated long range transmission by beaming 475 W of microwave power to a rectenna a mile away, with a microwave to DC conversion efficiency of 54 . At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he and Robert Dickinson transmitted 30 kW DC output power across 1.5 km with 2.38 GHz microwaves from a 26 m dish to a 7.3 x 3.5 m rectenna array. The incident RF to DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna was 80 . In 1983 Japan launched Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction Experiment , a rocket experiment to test transmission of high power microwaves through the ionosphere.In recent years a focus of research has been the development of wireless powered drone aircraft, which began in 1959 with the Dept. of Defense's RAMP project which sponsored Brown's research. In 1987 Canada's Communications Research Center developed a small prototype airplane called Stationary High Altitude Relay Platform to relay telecommunication data between points on earth similar to a communications satellite. Powered by a rectenna, it could fly at 13 miles altitude and stay aloft for months. In 1992 a team at Kyoto University built a more advanced craft called MILAX . In 2003 NASA flew the first laser powered aircraft. The small model plane's motor was powered by electricity generated by photocells from a beam of infrared light from a ground based laser, while a control system kept the laser pointed at the plane.

            "text": "The Edison Machine Works was a manufacturing company set up to produce dynamos, large electric motors, and other components of the electrical illumination system being built in the 1880s by Thomas A. Edison in New York City.  History The need for equipment in the development of a large scale electric illumination utility in New York City, starting around 1880, soon outstripped the capacity of Thomas Edison's machine shop at Menlo Park. To alleviate the problem in 1881 Edison leased the old Etna Iron Works on Goerck Street, Lower Manhattan and set up the Edison Machine Works with Edison providing 90 of the capital and investor partner Charles Batchelor providing 10 . The workforce built up to some 800 men supervised by Edison machinist Charles Dean. This shop supplied jumbo dynamos for the original Pearl Street Station as well as dynamos of various sizes for the different types of electric light installations Edison was offering customers. The Machine Works was incorporated in 1884 with Edison investor Charles Batchelor as general manager, John Kruesi as assistant general manager, and Samuel Insull as secretary. At the end of 1885 the Electric Tube Company and the Edison Shafting Manufacturing Company were merged into the Edison Machine Works. The Machine Works also had a department that designed and tested equipment and trained Edison workers how to wire buildings and install and repair dynamos. New types of dynamos were designed here as well as improved power consumption meters. The demands of the expanding utility soon overtaxed the cramped lower Manhattan shop. Extra lathes needed for production had to be set up on the sidewalks outside the building connected through the factory windows by long drive belts. Strikes, unionizing attempts, and the general expense of labor and land in New York City sent Edison looking for a site for a new factory. In 1886 the Machine Works, along with 200 of its workers, were moved to two unfinished factory buildings on a 10 acre site in Schenectady, NY, intended to have been the McQueen Locomotive Works. The new factory was put under the control of Samuel Insull. Edison Machine Works continued as a separate company until 1889, when all of Edison's electric related companies were merged to form Edison General Electric. The plant expanded rapidly and 1892 saw the merger of Edison General Electric and the Thomson Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts to form General Electric with the Schenectady location used as GE's headquarters for many years thereafter.  Notable employees Justus B. Entz joined Edison Machine Works in 1887 Reginald Fessenden worked at the Edison Machine Works in 1886 Kunihiko Iwadare joined Edison Machine Works in 1887 Emil Kolben joined Edison Machine Works in 1888 John W.

            "text": "The electric power industry covers the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric power to the general public and industry. The commodity sold is actually energy, not power, e.g. consumers pay for kilowatt hours, power multiplied by time, which is energy. The commercial distribution of electricity started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting. In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the industry. What was once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements of developed economies. By the middle of the 20th century, electricity was seen as a natural monopoly , only efficient if a restricted number of organizations participated in the market; in some areas, vertically integrated companies provide all stages from generation to retail, and only governmental supervision regulated the rate of return and cost structure. Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find.  History  Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the United States, Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed direct current electricity. Robert Hammond, in December 1881, demonstrated the new electric light in the Sussex town of Brighton in the UK for a trial period. The ensuing success of this installation enabled Hammond to put this venture on both a commercial and legal footing, as a number of shop owners wanted to use the new electric light. Thus the Hammond Electricity Supply Co. was launched. In early 1882, Edison opened the world's first steam powered electricity generating station at Holborn Viaduct in London, where he had entered into an agreement with the City Corporation for a period of three months to provide street lighting. In time he had supplied a number of local consumers with electric light. The method of supply was direct current . Whilst the Godalming and the 1882 Holborn Viaduct Scheme closed after a few years the Brighton Scheme continued on, and supply was in 1887 made available for 24 hours per day. It was later on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the Pearl Street Power Station in New York City and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the generation was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the danger from direct contact and increases the required insulation thickness. Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.The mid to late 1880s saw the introduction of alternating current systems in Europe and the U.S. AC power had an advantage in that transformers, installed at power stations, could be used to raise the voltage from the generators, and transformers at local substations could reduce voltage to supply loads. Increasing the voltage reduced the current in the transmission and distribution lines and hence the size of conductors and distribution losses. This made it more economical to distribute power over long distances. Generators could be located far from the loads. AC and DC competed for a while, during a period called the war of the currents. The DC system was able to claim slightly greater safety, but this difference was not great enough to overwhelm the enormous technical and economic advantages of alternating current which eventually won out. The AC power system used today developed rapidly, backed by industrialists such as George Westinghouse with Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky, Galileo Ferraris, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs, Carl Wilhelm Siemens, William Stanley Jr., Nikola Tesla, and others contributed to this field. Power electronics is the application of solid state electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. Power electronics started with the development of the mercury arc rectifier in 1902, used to convert AC into DC. From the 1920s on, research continued on applying thyratrons and grid controlled mercury arc valves to power transmission. Grading electrodes made them suitable for high voltage direct current power transmission. In 1933, selenium rectifiers were invented. Transistor technology dates back to 1947, with the invention of the point contact transistor, which was followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. By the 1950s, higher power semiconductor diodes became available and started replacing vacuum tubes. In 1956, the silicon controlled rectifier was introduced, increasing the range of power electronic applications.A breakthrough in power electronics came with the invention of the MOSFET in 1959. Generations of MOSFETs enabled power designers to achieve performance and density levels not possible with bipolar transistors. In 1969, Hitachi introduced the first vertical power MOSFET, which would later be known as the VMOS . The power MOSFET has since become the most common power device in the world, due to its low gate drive power, fast switching speed, easy advanced paralleling capability, wide bandwidth, ruggedness, easy drive, simple biasing, ease of application, and ease of repair.While HVDC is increasingly being used to transmit large quantities of electricity over long distances or to connect adjacent asynchronous power systems, the bulk of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing takes place using alternating current.  Organization  The electric power industry is commonly split up into four processes. These are electricity generation such as a power station, electric power transmission, electricity distribution and electricity retailing. In many countries, electric power companies own the whole infrastructure from generating stations to transmission and distribution infrastructure. For this reason, electric power is viewed as a natural monopoly. The industry is generally heavily regulated, often with price controls and is frequently government owned and operated. However, the modern trend has been growing deregulation in at least the latter two processes.The nature and state of market reform of the electricity market often determines whether electric companies are able to be involved in just some of these processes without having to own the entire infrastructure, or citizens choose which components of infrastructure to patronise. In countries where electricity provision is deregulated, end users of electricity may opt for more costly green electricity.  Generation  All forms of electricity generation have positive and negative aspects. Technology will probably eventually declare the most preferred forms, but in a market economy, the options with less overall costs generally will be chosen above other sources. It is not clear yet which form can best meet the necessary energy demands or which process can best solve the demand for electricity. There are indications that renewable energy is rapidly becoming the most viable in economic terms. A diverse mix of generation sources reduces the risks of electricity price spikes.  Electric power transmission  Electric power transmission is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. The interconnected lines which facilitate this movement are known as a transmission network. This is distinct from the local wiring between high voltage substations and customers, which is typically referred to as electric power distribution. The combined transmission and distribution network is known as the power grid in North America, or just the grid . In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia and New Zealand, the network is known as the National Grid. A wide area synchronous grid, also known as an interconnection in North America, directly connects many generators delivering AC power with the same relative frequency numerous consumers. For example, there are four major interconnections in North America grid . In Europe one large grid connects most of continental Europe. Historically, transmission and distribution lines were owned by the same company, but starting in the 1990s, many countries have liberalized the regulation of the electricity market in ways that have led to the separation of the electricity transmission business from the distribution business.  Electric power distribution  Electric power distribution is the final stage in the delivery of electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. Primary distribution lines carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through secondary distribution lines. Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary distribution lines through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.  Electric retailing  Electricity retailing is the final sale of electricity from generation to the end use consumer.  World electricity industries  The organization of the electrical sector of a country or region varies depending on the economic system of the country. In some places, all electric power generation, transmission and distribution is provided by a government controlled organization. Other regions have private or investor owned utility companies, city or municipally owned companies, cooperative companies owned by their own customers, or combinations. Generation, transmission and distribution may be offered by a single company, or different organizations may provide each of these portions of the system. Not everyone has access to grid electricity. About 840 million people had no access in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.  Market reform The business model behind the electric utility has changed over the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990.  United States  In 1996 1999 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission made a series of decisions which were intended to open the U.S. wholesale power market to new players, with the hope that spurring competition would save consumers 4 to 5 billion per year and encourage technical innovation in the industry. Steps were taken to give all market participants open access to existing interstate transmission lines.  Order No. 888 ordered vertically integrated electric utilities to functionally separate their transmission, power generation and marketing businesses to prevent self dealing. Order No. 889 set up a system to provide all participants with timely access to information about available transmission capacity and prices. The FERC also endorsed the concept of appointing independent system operators to manage the electric power grid a function that was traditionally the responsibility of vertically integrated electric utility companies. The concept of an independent system operator evolved into that of regional transmission organizations . FERC's intention was that all U.S. companies owning interstate electric transmission lines would place those facilities under the control of an RTO. In its Order No. 2000 , issued in 1999, FERC specified the minimum capabilities that an RTO should possess.These decisions, which were intended to create a fully interconnected grid and an integrated national power market, resulted in the restructuring of the U.S. electricity industry. That process was soon dealt two setbacks: the California energy crisis of 2000, and the Enron scandal and collapse. Although industry restructuring proceeded, these events made clear that competitive markets could be manipulated and thus must be properly designed and monitored. Furthermore, the Northeast blackout of 2003 highlighted the need for a dual focus on competitive pricing and strong reliability standards.  Other countries  In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK's National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought several electric utilities in New England for 3.2 billion. Between 1995 and 1997, seven of the 12 Regional Electric Companies in England and Wales were bought by U.S. energy companies. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; solar engineering and photovoltaic systems; off shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.  Outlook Electricity is expected to see growing demand in the future. The Information Revolution is highly reliant on electric power. Other growth areas include emerging new electricity exclusive technologies, developments in space conditioning, industrial processes, and transportation .  See also   References   Further reading P.

            "text": "Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe in Scandinavia. It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge tunnel across the resund. At 450,295 square kilometres , Sweden is the largest Nordic country, the third largest country in the European Union, and the fifth largest country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.5 million, and a low population density of 25.5 inhabitants per square kilometre , with around 87 of Swedes residing in urban areas in the central and southern half of the country. Sweden has a nature dominated by forests and a lot of lakes, including some of the largest in Europe. Plenty of long rivers run from the Scandes range through the landscape, primarily emptying into the northern tributaries of the Baltic Sea. It has an extensive coastline and most of the population lives near a major body of water. With the country ranging from 55 N to 69 N, the climate of Sweden is diverse due to the length of the country. The usual conditions are mild for the latitudes with a maritime south, continental centre and subarctic north. Snow cover is infrequent in the densely populated south, but reliable on higher latitudes. Furthermore, the rain shadow of the Scandes results in quite dry winters and sunny summers in much of the country. Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats and Swedes and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population, the dominance of the Hanseatic League in Northern Europe threatened Scandinavia economically and politically. This led to the forming of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years' War on the Protestant side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the Swedish Empire was formed, this became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present day Finland by Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, breaking even Switzerland's record for peace. Sweden maintained an official policy of neutrality during wartime and non participation in military alliances during peacetime, although Sweden secretly relied on U.S. nuclear submarines during the Cold War. Sweden has since 2008 joined EU battlegroups, provided intelligence to NATO and since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO. In 2022, Sweden applied for NATO membership and was formally invited to join the alliance at the NATO Summit in Madrid.Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy, with legislative power vested in the 349 member unicameral Riksdag. It is a unitary state, currently divided into 21 counties and 290 municipalities. Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens. It has the world's 12th highest per capita income and ranks very highly in quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic competitiveness, income equality, gender equality, prosperity and human development. Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995 but rejected Eurozone membership following a referendum. It is also a member of the United Nations, the Nordic Council, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development .  Etymology  The name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the root s e, meaning one's own , referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period. The native Swedish name, Sverige , translates as realm of the Swedes , which excluded the Geats in G taland. The contemporary English variation was derived in the 17th century from Middle Dutch and Middle Low German. As early as 1287, references are found in Middle Dutch referring to a lande van sweden , with swede as the singular form. In Old English the country was known as Sw oland or Sw or ce, and in Early Modern English as Swedeland. Some Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, use the terms Ruotsi and Rootsi; these variations refer to the Rus' people who inhabited the coastal areas of Roslagen in Uppland and who gave their name to Russia.  History   Prehistory  Sweden's prehistory begins in the Aller d oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late Palaeolithic reindeer hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania. This period was characterised by small clans of hunter gatherers who relied on flint technology.Sweden and its people were first described by Publius Cornelius Tacitus in his written work Germania . In Germania 44 and 45 he mentions the Swedes as a powerful tribe with ships that had a prow at each end . Which kings ruled these Suiones is unknown, but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the second century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic languages.In the sixth century, Jordanes names two tribes living in Scandza, both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the Suetidi and Suehans. Suetidi is considered to be the Latin form of Sv j , the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the Suetidi and Dani as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature. The Suehans were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the Thyringi of Germania .  Vikings  The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad. Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids. The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard. The Swedish Vikings, called Rus are believed to be the founding fathers of Kievan Rus'. The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings saying: I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort. The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden, such as the Greece runestones and the Varangian runestones. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the England runestones. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill fated expedition of Ingvar the Far Travelled to Serkland, the region south east of the Caspian Sea. Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar runestones, none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.  Kingdom of Sweden  It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the list of Swedish monarchs is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both Svealand and G taland as one province, beginning with Eric the Victorious. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem Beowulf describes semi legendary Swedish Geatish wars in the sixth century. G taland in this sense mainly includes the provinces of sterg tland and V sterg tland . The island of Gotland was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time . Sm land was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of Kalmar with its castle was of importance. The south west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces . North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province Bohusl n. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of Norrland. During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, Ystad in the Danish province Scania and Paviken on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 CE have been found in Ystad. In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the ninth and tenth century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined. Saint Ansgar is usually credited with introducing Christianity to Sweden in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace paganism until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. In the years 1150 1293 according to the legend of Eric IX and the Eric Chronicles Swedish kings made a first, second and third crusade to pagan Finland against Finns, Tavastians, and Karelians and started conflicts with the Rus' who no longer had any connection with Sweden. The Swedish colonisation of the coastal areas of Finland also started during the 12th and 13th century. In the 14th century, the colonisation began to be more organised, and by the end of the century, several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes. Except for the provinces of Scania, Blekinge and Halland in the south west of the Scandinavian peninsula, which were parts of the Kingdom of Denmark during this time, feudalism never developed in Sweden as it did in the rest of Europe. As a result the peasantry remained largely a class of free farmers throughout most of Swedish history. Slavery was not common in Sweden, and what slavery there was tended to be driven out of existence by the spread of Christianity, by the difficulty of obtaining slaves from lands east of the Baltic Sea, and by the development of cities before the 16th century. Indeed, both slavery and serfdom were abolished altogether by a decree of King Magnus IV in 1335. Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of Dalsland would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.In the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the Black Death. The population of Sweden and most of Europe was decimated. The population did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died during the period of 1349 1351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the Hanseatic League, active especially at Visby. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen Margaret I of Denmark affected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the Kalmar Union. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility. Many times the Swedish crown was inherited by child kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently, real power was held for long periods by regents chosen by the Swedish parliament. King Christian II of Denmark, who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the Stockholm blood bath and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June in 1523, they made Gustav Vasa their king. This is sometimes considered as the foundation of modern Sweden. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the Protestant Reformation. The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at L beck on the Baltic coast of Northern Germany in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea. In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities. Having their own navy, the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates. The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, L beck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden. Under the Hanseatic trade, two thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of textiles, while the remaining third was salt. The main exports from Sweden were iron and copper.However, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa , and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.The end of the 16th century was marked by a final phase of rivalry between the remaining Catholics and the new Protestant communities. In 1592, Gustav Vasa's Catholic grandson and king of Poland, Sigismund, ascended the Swedish throne. He pursued to strengthen Rome's influence by initiating Counter Reformation and created a dual monarchy, which temporarily became known as the Polish Swedish Union. His despotic rule, strongly characterised by intolerance towards the Protestants, sparked a civil war that plunged Sweden into poverty. In opposition, Sigismund's uncle and successor, Charles Vasa, summoned the Uppsala Synod in 1593 which officially confirmed the modern Church of Sweden as Lutheran. Following his deposition in 1599, Sigismund attempted to reclaim the throne at every expense and hostilities between Poland and Sweden continued for the next one hundred years.  Swedish Empire  During the 17th century, Sweden emerged as a European great power. Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and sparsely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation. Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and Poland Lithuania in multiple conflicts, including the Thirty Years' War.During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor, ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he was killed at the Battle of L tzen in 1632. After the Battle of N rdlingen in 1634, Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro Swedish sentiment among the German states faded. These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: Swedish Pomerania, Bremen Verden and Wismar. From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and Denmark Norway fought the Torstenson War. The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe. In the middle of the 17th century, Sweden was the third largest country in Europe by land area, surpassed by only Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of Charles X after the treaty of Roskilde in 1658, following Charles X's risky but successful crossing of the Danish Belts. The foundation of Sweden's success during this period is credited to Gustav I's major changes to the Swedish economy in the 16th century, and his introduction of Protestantism. In the 17th century, Sweden was engaged in many wars, for example with the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, with both sides competing for territories of today's Baltic states, with Sweden suffering a notable defeat at the Battle of Kircholm. One third of the Finnish population died in the devastating Great Famine of 1695 1697 that struck the country. Famine also hit Sweden, killing roughly 10 of Sweden's population.The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the Deluge. After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles X's son, Charles XI, to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, Charles XII, was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Russia, the most serious threat to Sweden at this time, had a larger army but lagged far behind in both equipment and training.After the Battle of Narva in 1700, one of the first battles of the Great Northern War, the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia. However, Charles XII did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland Lithuania and defeating the Polish king, Augustus II the Strong, and his Saxon allies at the Battle of Klisz w in 1702. This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army. After the success of invading Poland, Charles XII decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava in 1709. After a long march exposed to Cossack raids, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great's scorched earth techniques and the extremely cold winter of 1709, the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition, the plague raging in East Central Europe devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in 1710. Returning to Sweden in 1715, Charles XII launched two campaigns against Norway on 1716 and 1718, respectively. During the second attempt, he was shot to death during the siege of Fredriksten fortress. The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew. Forced to cede large areas of land in the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea. With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present day Sweden and 50,000 from the Finnish part of Sweden.In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous Grand Principality of Finland in Imperial Russia.In interest of re establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the Napoleonic Wars. However, in 1810, a French Marshal, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, was chosen as heir presumptive to the decrepit Charles XIII; in 1818, he established the House of Bernadotte, taking the regnal name of Charles XIV. Sweden's role in the Battle of Leipzig gave it the authority to force Denmark Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for the northern German provinces, at the Treaty of Kiel. The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, Charles XIII. He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the Convention of Moss, which forced Norway into a personal union with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905. The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.  Modern history  The Swedish East India Company, Ostindiska Kompaniet, began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden's west coast, the mouth of G ta lv river is very wide and has the county's largest and best harbour for high seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city. There was a significant population increase during the 18th and 19th centuries, which the writer Esaias Tegn r in 1833 attributed to the peace, the smallpox vaccine, and the potatoes . Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1 of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Denmark and Western European countries began to industrialise. Many looked towards America for a better life during this time. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States. In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg . Most Swedish immigrants moved to the midwestern United States, with a large population in Minnesota, with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada. Despite the slow rate of industrialisation into the 19th century, many important changes were taking place in the agrarian economy due to constant innovations and a rapid population growth. These innovations included government sponsored programmes of enclosure, aggressive exploitation of agricultural lands, and the introduction of new crops such as the potato. Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in Swedish politics, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party . Between 1870 and 1914, Sweden began developing the industrialised economy that exists today.Strong grassroots movements sprang up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century , creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the Industrial Revolution progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re introduction of parliamentarism, and the country was democratised.  World War I and World War II  Sweden was officially neutral during World War I. However, under pressure from the German Empire, they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers. Most notably, mining the resund channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies. Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the White Guards alongside the Germans against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied land in cooperation with the German Empire. As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed. Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. The Swedish government felt that it was in no position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions. Sweden also supplied steel and machined parts to Germany throughout the war. The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the Swedish rescue missions to internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries and the Baltic states. The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews. Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.  Post war era  Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe. Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD. During most of the post war era, the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in co operation with trade unions and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.Sweden was one of the founding states of the European Free Trade Area . During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of the then European Economic Community .Sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973 74 and 1978 79. In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was robotised.Between 1970 and 1990, the overall tax burden rose by over 10 , and the growth was low compared with other countries in Western Europe. Eventually, the government began to spend over half of the country's gross domestic product. Swedish GDP per capita ranking declined during this time.  Recent history  A bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti unemployment policies to anti inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s. Sweden's GDP declined by around 5 . In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500 .The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods. Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership, and a referendum passed with 52.3 in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate voted against the country joining the Euro currency. In 2006 Sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre right Alliance defeated the incumbent Social Democrat government. Following the rapid growth of support for the anti immigration Sweden Democrats, and their entrance to the Riksdag in 2010, the Alliance became a minority cabinet. Until recently Sweden remained non aligned militarily, although it participated in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries, in addition to extensive cooperation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry. However, in 2022 in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden moved to formally join the NATO alliance. Among others, Swedish companies export weapons that were used by the American military in Iraq. Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations, including Afghanistan, where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Cyprus. Sweden also participated in enforcing a UN mandated no fly zone over Libya during the Arab Spring. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009. In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013, it was estimated that 15 of the population was foreign born, and an additional 5 of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges. Violent incidents have periodically occurred including the 2013 Stockholm riots, which broke out following the police shooting of an elderly Portuguese immigrant. In response to these violent events, the anti immigration opposition party, the Sweden Democrats, promoted their anti immigration policies, while the left wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre right government's socioeconomic policies.In 2014, Stefan L fven won the General Election and became the new Swedish Prime Minister to succeed Fredrik Reinfeldt of the liberal conservative Moderate Party. The Sweden Democrats held the balance of power and voted the government's budget down in the Riksdag, but due to agreements between the government and the Alliance, the government was able to hang onto power. Sweden was heavily affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis, eventually forcing the government to tighten regulations of entry to the country, as Sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly from Africa and the Middle East per week in autumn, overwhelming existing structures. Some of the asylum restrictions were relaxed again later.The 2018 general election saw the Red greens lose seats to the right wing Sweden Democrats and to the centre right parties of the former Alliance. Despite holding only 33 of the seats in the Riksdag, the Social Democrats and the Greens managed to form a minority government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, in January 2019, relying on supply and confidence from the Centre Party, Liberals and the Left Party.In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven announced his resignation and finance minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden's ruling Social Democrats in November 2021. On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden's first female prime minister. She formed a minority government made up of only her Social Democrats. Her plan for forming a new coalition government with the Green Party was unsuccessful because her budget proposal failed to pass.  Geography  Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain , a range that separates Sweden from Norway. Finland is located to its north east. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to Denmark by the resund Bridge. Its border with Norway is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe. Sweden lies between latitudes 55 and 70 N, and mostly between longitudes 11 and 25 E . At 449,964 km2 , Sweden is the 55th largest country in the world, the fifth largest country in Europe, and the largest country in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsj n, near Kristianstad, at 2.41 m below sea level. The highest point is Kebnekaise at 2,111 m above sea level. Sweden has 25 provinces or landskap, based on culture, geography and history. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's self identity. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large lands, parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern G taland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60 of the country. Sweden also has the Vindelfj llen Nature Reserve, one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha . About 15 of Sweden lies north of the Arctic Circle. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65 of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the resund Region in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohusl n, and in the valley of lake M laren and Stockholm. Gotland and land are Sweden's largest islands; V nern and V ttern are its largest lakes. V nern is the third largest in Europe, after Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in Russia. Combined with the third and fourth largest lakes M laren and Hj lmaren, these lakes take up a significant part of southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the G ta Canal in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of Norrk ping and Gothenburg by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.Sweden also has plenty of long rivers draining the lakes. Northern and Central Sweden have several wide rivers known as lvar, commonly sourced within the Scandinavian Mountains. The longest river is Klar lven G ta lv, which originates in Tr ndelag in central Norway, running 1,160 kilometres before it enters the sea at Gothenburg. Dal lven and the Torne are the second and third longest rivers in the country. Torne marks a large part of the Finland border. In southern Sweden, narrower rivers known as ar are also common. The vast majority of municipal seats are set either on the sea, a river or a lake and the majority of the country's population live in coastal municipalities.  Climate  Most of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub zero temperatures; autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The northern parts of the country have a subarctic climate while the central parts have a humid continental climate. The coastal south can be defined as having either a humid continental climate using the 0 C isotherm, or an oceanic climate using the 3 C isotherm. Due to the increased maritime moderation in the peninsular south, summer differences between the coastlines of the southernmost and northernmost regions are about 2 C in summer and 10 C in winter. This grows further when comparing areas in the northern interior where the winter difference in the far north is about 15 C throughout the country. The warmest summers usually happen in the M laren Valley around Stockholm due to the vast landmass shielding the middle east coast from Atlantic low pressure systems in July compared to the south and west. Daytime highs in Sweden's municipal seats vary from 19 C to 24 C in July and 9 C to 3 C in January. The colder temperatures are influenced by the higher elevation in the northern interior. At sea level instead, the coldest average highs range from 21 C to 6 C . As a result of the mild summers, the arctic region of Norrbotten has some of the northernmost agriculture in the world.Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the Gulf Stream and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation. Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States. Because of Sweden's high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the Arctic Circle, the sun never sets for part of each summer, and it never rises for part of each winter. In the capital, Stockholm, daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually. The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was 38 C in M lilla in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was 52.6 C in Vuoggatj lme on 2 February 1966. Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That, in turn, renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby British Isles, even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern Spain. In winter, however, the same high pressure systems sometimes put the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Apart from the ice free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The relative strength of low and high pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers. When hot continental air hits the country, the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to 30 C or above even in coastal areas. Nights normally remain cool, especially in inland areas. Coastal areas can see so called tropical nights above 20 C occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers. Summers can be cool, especially in the north of the country. Transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four season climate applies to most of Sweden's territory, except in Scania where some years do not record a meteorological winter or in the high Lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist. On average, most of Sweden receives between 500 and 800 mm of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the global average. The south western part of the country receives more precipitation, between 1,000 and 1,200 mm , and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to 2,000 mm . Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the rain shadow of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north west Sweden. The blocking of cool and wet air in summer, as well as the greater landmass, leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country, with quite warm summers at the Bothnia Bay coast at 65 degrees latitude, which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines. It is predicted that as the Barents Sea gets less frozen in the coming winters, becoming thus Atlantified , additional evaporation will increase future snowfalls in Sweden and much of continental Europe.  Vegetation  Sweden has a considerable south to north distance which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places. Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones. These are: The southern deciduous forest zone The southern coniferous forest zone The northern coniferous forest zone, or the Taiga The alpine birch zone The bare mountain zoneSouthern deciduous forest zone, also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The beech are the most dominant tree, but oak can also form smaller forests. elm at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to Dutch Elm disease. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include hornbeam, elder, hazel, fly honeysuckle, linden , spindle, yew, alder buckthorn, blackthorn, aspen, European rowan, Swedish whitebeam, juniper, European holly, ivy, dogwood, goat willow, larch, bird cherry, wild cherry, maple, ash, alder along creeks, and in sandy soil birch compete with pine. Spruce is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980, large areas were planted with it. They tend to grow too quickly due to being outside of their native range and large distances between the tree rings cause poor board quality. Later some spruce trees began to die before reaching optimal height, and many more of the coniferous trees were uprooted during cyclones. During the last 40 50 years large areas of former spruce plantings have been replanted with deciduous forest.Southern coniferous forest zone, also known as the boreo nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone is delimited by the oak's northern natural limit and the Spruce's southern natural limit, between the southern deciduous zone and the Taiga farther north. In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found, mainly spruce and pine, mixed with various deciduous trees. Birch grows largely everywhere. The beech's northern boundary crosses this zone. This is however not the case with oak and ash. Although in its natural area, also planted Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas. The northern coniferous forest zone or the Taiga begins north of the natural boundary of the oak. Of deciduous species the birch is the only one of significance. Pine and spruce are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.The alpine birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of birch can grow. Where this vegetation zone ends, no trees grow at all: the bare mountain zone.Sweden had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35 10, ranking it 103rd globally out of 172 countries.  Government and politics   Constitutional framework  Sweden has four fundamental laws which together form the Constitution: the Instrument of Government , the Act of Succession , the Freedom of the Press Act , and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression .The public sector in Sweden is divided into two parts: the legal person known as the State and local authorities: the latter include Regional Councils  in 2020 and local Municipalities . The local authorities, rather than the State, make up the larger part of the public sector in Sweden. Regional Councils and Municipalities are independent of one another, the former merely covers a larger geographical area than the latter. The local authorities have self rule, as mandated by the Constitution, and their own tax base. Notwithstanding their self rule, local authorities are nevertheless in practice interdependent upon the State, as the parameters of their responsibilities and the extent of their jurisdiction are specified in the Local Government Act passed by the Riksdag.Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, and King Carl XVI Gustaf is the head of state, but the role of the monarch is limited to ceremonial and representative functions. Under the provisions of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the King lacks any formal political power. The King opens the annual Riksdag session, chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government, holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Government, chairs the meetings of the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs , and receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad. In addition, the King pays State Visits abroad and receives those incoming as host. Apart from strictly official duties, the King and the other members of Royal Family undertake a variety of unofficial and other representative duties within Sweden and abroad.Legislative power is vested in the unicameral Riksdag with 349 members. General elections are held every four years, on the second Sunday of September. Legislation may be initiated by the Government or by members of the Riksdag. Members are elected on the basis of proportional representation to a four year term. The internal workings of the Riksdag are, in addition to the Instrument of Government, regulated by the Riksdag Act . The fundamental laws can be altered by the Riksdag alone; only an absolute majority with two separate votes, separated by a general election in between, is required. The Government operates as a collegial body with collective responsibility and consists of the Prime Minister appointed and dismissed by the Speaker of the Riksdag  and other cabinet ministers , appointed and dismissed at the sole discretion of the Prime Minister. The Government is the supreme executive authority and is responsible for its actions to the Riksdag.Most of the State administrative authorities report to the Government, including the Armed Forces, the Enforcement Authority, the National Library, the Swedish police and the Tax Agency. A unique feature of Swedish State administration is that individual cabinet ministers do not bear any individual ministerial responsibility for the performance of the agencies within their portfolio; as the director generals and other heads of government agencies reports directly to the Government as a whole; and individual ministers are prohibited to interfere; thus the origin of the pejorative in Swedish political parlance term ministerstyre in matters that are to be handled by the individual agencies, unless otherwise specifically provided for in law. The Judiciary is independent from the Riksdag, Government and other State administrative authorities. The role of judicial review of legislation is not practised by the courts; instead, the Council on Legislation gives non binding opinions on legality. There is no stare decisis in that courts are not bound by precedent, although it is influential.  Political parties and elections  The Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading role in Swedish politics since 1917, after the Reformists had confirmed their strength and the left wing revolutionaries formed their own party. After 1932, most governments have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections since World War II 1976, 1979, 1991, 2006 and 2010 have given the assembled bloc of centre right parties enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government. For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag the Social Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Left Party before the Green Party became the sixth party in the 1988 election. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the Christian Democrats and New Democracy. The 1994 election saw the return of the Greens and the demise of New Democracy. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the Sweden Democrats, gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the European Parliament, parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the June List , the Pirate Party , and Feminist Initiative . In the 2006 general election the Moderate Party formed the centre right Alliance for Sweden bloc and won a majority of the Riksdag seats. In the 2010 general election the Alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party. The Alliance won a plurality of 173 seats, but remained two seats short of a 175 seat majority. Nevertheless, neither the Alliance, nor the left block, chose to form a coalition with the Sweden Democrats.The outcome of the 2014 general election resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre left parties in comparison to the centre right Alliance for Sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively. The non aligned Sweden Democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats. On 3 October 2014, Stefan L fven formed a minority government consisting of the Social Democrats and the Greens.In August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan L fven announced his resignation and finance minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden's ruling Social Democrats in November 2021. On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden's first female prime minister. She formed a minority government made up of only her Social Democrats. Her plan for forming a new coalition government with the Green Party was unsuccessful the coalition partner left after her budget proposal failed to pass. In the 2022 election, the remnants of the Alliance were able to secure a narrow majority. This was backed up by the surging Sweden Democrats becoming the second largest party. The election saw Andersson resigning from her post, with the Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson the likely replacement. The election saw the right wing coalition win dozens of small towns always dominated by the left, while suffering major losses in the big cities.Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison. Although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout and 87.18 in 2018. Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours.  Administrative divisions  Sweden is a unitary state divided into 21 regions and 290 municipalities . Every region corresponds to a county with a number of municipalities per county. Regions and municipalities are both local government bur have different roles and separate responsibilities. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by regional councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a region with only one municipality and the functions of region and municipality are performed by the same organisation.Municipal and region government in Sweden is similar to city commission and cabinet style council government. Both levels have legislative assemblies that are elected from party list proportional representation at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections. Municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512 parishes . These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the Church of Sweden and still have some importance as census districts for census taking and elections. The Swedish central government has 21 County Administrative Boards , which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government. Each county administrative board is led by a County Governor appointed for a term of six years. The list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back, in most cases, to 1634 when the counties were created by Lord High Chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to co ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the Riksdag and Government. There are older historical divisions, primarily the twenty five provinces and three lands, which still retain cultural significance.  Political history  The actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown. Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the Svear ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the Svear and the G tar of G taland being united under one ruler. In the first case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of Swedish monarchs from when Svealand and G taland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious and his son Olof Sk tkonung in the tenth century. These events are often described as the consolidation of Sweden, although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later. Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in mythical kings of Sweden and semi legendary kings of Sweden. Many of these kings are only mentioned in various saga and blend with Norse mythology. The title Sveriges och G tes Konung was last used for Gustaf I of Sweden, after which the title became King of Sweden, of the Goths and of the Wends in official documentation. Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends . This title was used up until 1973. The present King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was the first monarch officially proclaimed King of Sweden with no additional peoples mentioned in his title. The term riksdag was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of Arboga. During the Riksdag assemblies of 1527 and 1544, under King Gustav Vasa, representatives of all four estates of the realm were called on to participate for the first time. The monarchy became hereditary in 1544. Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic Privy council until 1680, followed by the King's autocratic rule initiated by the commoner estates of the Riksdag. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, the latter granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.In 1866, Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. In 1971 the parliament became unicameral. Legislative power was shared between the King and the Riksdag until 1975. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag. Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its popular movements , the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents . Sweden is currently leading the EU in statistics measuring equality in the political system and equality in the education system. The Global Gender Gap Report 2006 ranked Sweden as the number one country in terms of gender equality.Some Swedish political figures have become known worldwide, among these are: Raoul Wallenberg, Folke Bernadotte, the former Secretary General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskj ld, the former Prime Minister Olof Palme, the former Prime Minister and later Foreign minister Carl Bildt, the former President of the General Assembly of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, and the former International Atomic Energy Agency Iraq inspector Hans Blix.  Judicial system  The courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities. Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent. There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation. While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts. The Supreme Court of Sweden is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices , appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court. According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above average crime rates compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems. Bribe seeking is rare.A mid November 2013 news report announced that four prisons in Sweden were closed during the year due to a significant drop in the number of inmates. The decrease in the number of Swedish prisoners was considered out of the ordinary by the head of Sweden's prison and probation services, with prison numbers in Sweden falling by around 1 a year since 2004. Prisons were closed in the towns of by, H ja, B tshagen, and Kristianstad.  Foreign relations  Throughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a state of war since the end of the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the allied nor axis powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods, especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine. However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943. During the early Cold War era, Sweden combined its policy of non alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a security policy based on strong national defence. The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack. At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish DC 3 was shot down over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet MiG 15 jet fighter. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO. Another plane, a Catalina search and rescue plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to Cuba during the 1970s, during which he denounced Fulgencio Batista's government and praised contemporary Cuban and Cambodian revolutionaries in a speech. Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the Third World. On 27 October 1981, a Whiskey class submarine from the Soviet Union ran aground close to the naval base at Karlskrona in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the 1986 assassination of Olof Palme and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peacekeeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget. Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co operation. In 2022, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden moved to formally join the NATO alliance.  Military  The law is enforced in Sweden by several government entities. The Swedish police is a Government agency concerned with police matters. The National Task Force is a national SWAT unit within the police force. The Swedish Security Service's responsibilities are counter espionage, anti terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people. The F rsvarsmakten are a government agency reporting to the Swedish Ministry of Defence and responsible for the peacetime operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peacekeeping forces abroad, while maintaining the long term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into Army, Air Force and Navy. The head of the armed forces is the Supreme Commander , the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974, the King was pro forma Commander in Chief, but in reality it was clearly understood through the 20th century that the monarch would have no active role as a military leader. Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely focusing on those otherwise most fit for service. By law, all soldiers serving abroad must be volunteers. In 1975, the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003, it was down to 15,000. On 1 July 2010, Sweden ended routine conscription, switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness. Emphasis was to be placed on only recruiting those later prepared to volunteer for international service. The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 personnel. This in comparison with the 1980s, before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 servicemembers. However, on 11 December 2014, due to tensions in the Baltic area, the Swedish Government reintroduced one part of the Swedish conscription system, refresher training. On 2 March 2017, the government decided to reintroduce the remaining part of the Swedish conscription system, basic military training. The first recruits began their training in 2018. As the law is now gender neutral, both men and women may have to serve. Sweden decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.Swedish units have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Liberia, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Chad.  Economy  Sweden is the sixteenth richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export oriented mixed economy. Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50 of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth largest arms exporter in the world. Agriculture accounts for 2 of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration.Trade unions, employers' associations and collective agreements cover a large share of the employees in Sweden. The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors. Both the prominent role of collective bargaining and the way in which the high rate of coverage is achieved reflect the dominance of self regulation over state regulation in Swedish industrial relations. When the Swedish Ghent system was changed in 2007, resulting in considerably raised fees to unemployment funds, a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds occurred. In 2010, Sweden's income Gini coefficient was the third lowest among developed countries, at 0.25 slightly higher than Japan and Denmark suggesting Sweden had low income inequality. However, Sweden's wealth Gini coefficient at 0.853 was the second highest in developed countries, and above European and North American averages, suggesting high wealth inequality. Even on a disposable income basis, the geographical distribution of Gini coefficient of income inequality varies within different regions and municipalities of Sweden. Danderyd, outside Stockholm, has Sweden's highest Gini coefficient of income inequality, at 0.55, while Hofors near G vle has the lowest at 0.25. In and around Stockholm and Scania, two of the more densely populated regions of Sweden, the income Gini coefficient is between 0.35 and 0.55.In terms of structure, the Swedish economy is characterised by a large, knowledge intensive and export oriented manufacturing sector; an increasing, but comparatively small, business service sector; and by international standards, a large public service sector. Large organisations, both in manufacturing and services, dominate the Swedish economy. High and medium high technology manufacturing accounts for 9.9 of GDP.The 20 largest registered Swedish companies in 2007 were Volvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, Electrolux, Volvo Personvagnar, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, Scania, ICA, Hennes Mauritz, IKEA, Nordea, Preem, Atlas Copco, Securitas, Nordstjernan and SKF. The vast majority of Sweden's industry is privately controlled, unlike many other industrialised Western countries, and, in accordance with a historical standard, publicly owned enterprises are of minor importance. An estimated 4.5 million Swedish residents are employed, and around a third of the workforce completed tertiary education. In terms of GDP per hour worked, Sweden was the world's ninth highest in 2006 at US 31, compared to US 22 in Spain and US 35 in the United States. GDP per hour worked is growing 2.5 per year for the economy as a whole and the trade terms balanced productivity growth is 2 . According to the OECD, deregulation, globalisation, and technology sector growth have been key productivity drivers. Sweden is a world leader in privatised pensions and pension funding problems are relatively small compared to many other Western European countries. A pilot program to test the feasibility of a six hour workday, without loss of pay, will commence in 2014, involving the participation of Gothenburg municipal staff. The Swedish government is seeking to reduce its costs through decreased sick leave hours and increased efficiency. The typical worker receives 40 of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3 in 1990. The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990 1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time. Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most. In 2010 45.8 of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea. Tax income financed employment represents a third of the Swedish workforce, a substantially higher proportion than in most other countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms especially those in manufacturing were enacted in the early 1990s. Sweden is the fourth most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2012 2013. Sweden is the top performing country in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index . Sweden is ranked fourth in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013. According to the book The Flight of the Creative Class by the US economist Professor Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers. The book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most useful to business talent, technology and tolerance.Sweden maintains its own currency, the Swedish krona , a result of the Swedes having rejected the euro in a referendum. The Swedish Riksbank founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2 . According to the Economic Survey of Sweden 2007 by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid 1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.The largest trade flows are with Germany, the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland. Financial deregulation in the 1980s adversely affected the property market, leading to a bubble and eventually a crash in the early 1990s. Commercial property prices fell by up to two thirds, resulting in two Swedish banks having to be taken over by the government. In the following two decades the property sector strengthened. By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were again warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding. Household debt to income rose above 170 as the IMF was calling on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping what was available, pushing prices higher. By August 2014, 40 of home borrowers had interest only loans while those that didn't were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.  Energy  Sweden's energy market is largely privatised. The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh , and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh . At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc. produced 13 TWh of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh . Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh. Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes. Sweden joined the International Energy Agency in 1974, after the 1973 oil crisis strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. To protect against unexpected oil supply shocks and in accordance with international commitments made through the IEA, Sweden maintains a strategic petroleum reserve of at least 90 days of net oil imports. As of February 2022, Sweden's oil reserves totalled 130 days worth of net imports. Sweden has moved to generate electricity mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83 supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.Sweden is considered a global leader in decarbonisation. Politicians have made announcements about oil phase out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multibillion dollar investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, including energy taxes in general and carbon dioxide taxes in particular. Sweden was the first nation to implement carbon pricing, and its carbon prices remain the highest in the world as of 2020. This model has been shown to be particularly effective at decarbonizing the nation's economy. In 2014, Sweden was net exporter of electricity by a margin of 16 TWh; the production from wind power mills had increased to 11.5 TWh.  Transport  Sweden has 162,707 km of paved road and 1,428 km of expressways. Motorways run through Sweden and over the resund Bridge to Denmark. New motorways are still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to G vle was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left hand traffic from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right hand traffic in 1955, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as Dagen H. The Stockholm metro is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations. The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest operators are still owned by the state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include SJ, Veolia Transport, DSB, Green Cargo, T gkompaniet and Inlandsbanan. Most of the railways are owned and operated by Trafikverket. Most tram networks were closed in 1967, as Sweden changed from left side to right side driving. But they survived in Norrk ping, Stockholm and Gothenburg, with Gothenburg tram network being the largest. A new tram line opened in Lund on 13 December 2020. The largest airports include Stockholm Arlanda Airport 40 km north of Stockholm, G teborg Landvetter Airport , and Stockholm Skavsta Airport . Sweden hosts the two largest port companies in Scandinavia, Port of G teborg AB and the transnational company Copenhagen Malm Port AB. The most used airport for a large part of Southern Sweden is Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport which is located only 12 minutes by train from the closest Swedish railway station, Hyllie. Copenhagen Airport also is the largest international airport in Scandinavia and Finland. Sweden also has a number of car ferry connections to several neighbouring countries. This includes a route from Ume across the Gulf of Bothnia to Vaasa in Finland. There are several connections from the Stockholm area across the Sea of land to Mariehamn in land as well as Turku and Helsinki on the Finnish mainland and beyond to Estonia and St Petersburg in Russia. Ferry routes from the Stockholm area also connect with Ventspils and Riga in Latvia as well as Gda sk in Poland across the Baltic Sea. The ferry ports of Karlskrona and Karlshamn in southeastern Sweden serve Gdynia, Poland, and Klaipeda, Lithuania. Ystad and Trelleborg near the southern tip of Sweden have ferry links with the Danish island of Bornholm and the German ports of Sassnitz, Rostock and Travem nde, respectively, and ferries run to winouj cie, Poland, from both of them. Trelleborg is the busiest ferry port in Sweden in terms of weight transported by lorry. Its route to Sassnitz started as a steam operated railway ferry in the 19th century, and today's ferry still carries trains to Berlin during the summer months. Another ferry route to Travem nde originates from Malm . Despite the opening of the fixed link to Denmark, the resund Bridge, the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the resund between Helsingborg and the Danish port of Helsing r, known as the HH Ferry route. There are over seventy departures a day each way; during peak times, a ferry departs every fifteen minutes. Ports higher up the Swedish west coast include Varberg, with a ferry connection across the Kattegat to Grenaa in Denmark, and G teborg, serving Frederikshavn at the northern tip of Denmark and Kiel in Germany. Finally, there are ferries from Str mstad near the Norwegian border to destinations around the Oslofjord in Norway. There used to be ferry services to the United Kingdom from G teborg to destinations such as Immingham, Harwich and Newcastle, but these have been discontinued. Sweden has two domestic ferry lines with large vessels, both connecting Gotland with the mainland. The lines leave from Visby harbour on the island, and the ferries sail to either Oskarshamn or Nyn shamn. A smaller car ferry connects the island of Ven in resund with Landskrona.  Public policy  Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France , and the third highest total social spending at 30.2 of its GDP, after France and Belgium . Sweden spent 6.3 of its GDP, the ninth highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education. On health care, the country spent 10.0 of its total GDP, the 12th highest.Historically, Sweden provided solid support for free trade and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights , though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation. After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes. During this period Sweden's economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development far ahead of some wealthier countries .However, from the 1970s and onwards Sweden's GDP growth fell behind other industrialised countries and the country's per capita ranking fell from fourth to 14th place in a few decades. From the mid 1990s until today Sweden's economic growth has once again accelerated and has been higher than in most other industrialised countries during the last 15 years. A report from the United Nations Development Program predicted that Sweden's rating on the Human Development Index will fall from 0.949 in 2010 to 0.906 in 2030.Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s, and even trimming it back. Sweden has been relatively quick to adopt neoliberal policies, such as privatisation, financialisation and deregulation, compared to countries such as France. The current Swedish government is continuing the trend of moderate rollbacks of previous social reforms. Growth has been higher than in many other EU 15 countries. Also since the mid 1980s, Sweden has had the fastest growth in inequality of any developed nation, according to the OECD. This has largely been attributed to the reduction in state benefits and a shift toward the privatisation of public services. According to Barbro Sorman, an activist of the opposition Left Party, The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer. Sweden is starting to look like the USA. Nevertheless, it remains far more egalitarian than most nations. Partly as a result of these privatisations and widening economic disparity, the Swedes in the 2014 elections put the Social Democrats back in power.Sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Riksdag voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result, food prices fell somewhat. However, the liberalisations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened.Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30 and an additional high income state tax of 20 25 when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. Payroll taxes amount to 32 . In addition, a national VAT of 25 is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food , transportation, and books . Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol diesel and alcoholic beverages. In 2007, total tax revenue was 47.8 of GDP, the second highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1 2006. Sweden's inverted tax wedge the amount going to the service worker's wallet is approximately 15 , compared to 10 in Belgium, 30 in Ireland, and 50 in the United States. Public sector spending amounts to 53 of the GDP. State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries. Only Denmark has a larger public sector . Spending on transfers is also high. In 2015 and 2016, 69 per cent of the employed workers is organised in trade unions. Union density in 2016 was 62 among blue collar workers and 75 among white collar workers . Sweden has state supported union unemployment funds . Trade unions have the right to elect two representatives to the board in all Swedish companies with more than 25 employees. Sweden has a relatively high amount of sick leave per worker in OECD: the average worker loses 24 days due to sickness.The unemployment rate was 7.2 in May 2017 while the employment rate was 67.4 , with the workforce consisting of 4,983,000 people while 387,000 are unemployed. Unemployment among youth in 2012 was 24.2 , making Sweden the OECD country with the highest ratio of youth unemployment versus unemployment in general.  Science and technology  In the 18th century, Sweden's scientific revolution took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe. In 1739, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was founded, with people such as Carl Linnaeus and Anders Celsius as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. Gustaf Dal n founded AGA, and received the Nobel Prize for his sun valve. Alfred Nobel invented dynamite and instituted the Nobel Prizes. Lars Magnus Ericsson started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. Jonas Wenstr m was an early pioneer in alternating current and is along with Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla credited as one of the inventors of the three phase electrical system.The traditional engineering industry is still a major source of Swedish inventions, but pharmaceuticals, electronics and other high tech industries are gaining ground. Tetra Pak was an invention for storing liquid foods, invented by Erik Wallenberg. Losec, an ulcer medicine, was the world's best selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by AstraZeneca. More recently H kan Lans invented the Automatic Identification System, a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation navigation. A large portion of the Swedish economy is to this day based on the export of technical inventions, and many large multinational corporations from Sweden have their origins in the ingenuity of Swedish inventors.Swedish inventors held 47,112 patents in the United States in 2014, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden.Combined, the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate over 3.5 of GDP to research development per year, making Sweden's investment in R D as a percentage of GDP the second highest in the world. For several decades the Swedish government has prioritised scientific and R D activities. As a percentage of GDP, the Swedish government spends the most of any nation on research and development. Sweden tops other European countries in the number of published scientific works per capita.In 2009, the decisions to construct Sweden's two largest scientific installations, the synchrotron radiation facility MAX IV Laboratory and the European Spallation Source , were taken. Both installations will be built in Lund. The European Spallation Source, costing some SEK 14 billion to construct, will begin initial operations in 2019 with construction completion scheduled for 2025. The ESS will give an approximately 30 times stronger neutron beam than any of today's existing neutron source installations. The MAX IV, costing some SEK 3 billion, was inaugurated on 21 June 2016. Both facilities have strong implications on material research. Sweden was ranked second in the Global Innovation Index in 2019, 2020, and 2021.  Taxes  On average, 27 of taxpayers' money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5 goes to the police and military, and 42 to social security.The typical worker receives 40 of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3 in 1990. The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990 1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time. Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most. In 2010, 45.8 of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.  Pensions  Every Swedish resident receives a state pension. Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions. People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension. There are several types of pensions in Sweden: occupational and private pensions, and national retirement. A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.  Demographics  The total resident population of Sweden was 10,377,781 in October 2020. The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday 20 January 2017.The average population density is just over 25 people per km2 , with 1 437 persons per km2 in localities ., 87 of the population live in urban areas, which cover 1.5 of the entire land area. 63 of Swedes are in large urban areas. It is substantially higher in the south than in the north. The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 . The second and third largest cities are Gothenburg and Malm . Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the resund. The resund Region, the Danish Swedish cross border region around the resund that Malm is part of, has a population of 4 million. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of sterg tland, the western coast, the area around Lake M laren and the agricultural area around Uppsala. Norrland, which covers approximately 60 of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density . The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Sm land. An area known as Finnveden, which is located in the south west of Sm land, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people. Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population at the time, emigrated to North America, and most of them to the United States. There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate. In Canada, the community of Swedish ancestry is 330,000 strong.There are no official statistics on ethnicity, but according to Statistics Sweden, 2,752,572 inhabitants of Sweden were of a foreign background in 2021, defined as being born abroad or born in Sweden with both foreign born parents. Of these inhabitants, 2,090,503 persons were born abroad and 662,069 persons were born in Sweden to parents born abroad. In addition, 805,340 persons had one parent born abroad with the other parent born in Sweden.Sweden has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 41.1 years.  Language  The official language of Sweden is Swedish, a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography. Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than Norwegians. The same goes for standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish. The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it. Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5 of Sweden's population, and Finnish is recognised as a minority language. Owing to a 21st century influx of native speakers of Arabic, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish. However, no official statistics are kept on language use.Along with Finnish, four other minority languages are also recognised: Me nkieli, Sami, Romani, and Yiddish. Swedish became Sweden's official language on 1 July 2009, when a new language law was implemented. The issue of whether Swedish should be declared the official language had been raised in the past, and the Riksdag voted on the matter in 2005, but the proposal narrowly failed.In varying degrees, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English, owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo American influence and the tradition of subtitling rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the relative similarity of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2005 survey by Eurobarometer, 89 of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying natural sciences as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s. Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between first grade and ninth grade, with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. Some Danish and Norwegian is also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers. Because of the extensive mutual intelligibility between the three continental Scandinavian languages, Swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in Norway or Denmark.  Religion  Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping sir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s, a change led by Martin Luther's Swedish associate Olaus Petri, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished and Lutheranism became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non Lutherans, especially Calvinist Dutchmen, the Moravian Church and French Huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile. The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including Judaism and Roman Catholicism, were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various evangelical free churches, and, towards the end of the century, secularism, leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so called Dissenter Act of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another Christian denomination. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the law on freedom of religion in 1951. In 2000, the Church of Sweden was disestablished. Sweden was the second Nordic country to disestablish its state church .At the end of 2018, 57.7 of Swedes belonged to the Church of Sweden; this number had been decreasing by about 1.5 percentage points a year for the previous seven years and one percentage point a year on average for the previous two decades. Approximately 2 of the church's members regularly attend Sunday services. The reason for the large number of inactive members is partly that, until 1996, children automatically became members at birth if at least one of the parents was a member. Since 1996, only children and adults who are christened become members. Some 275,000 Swedes are today members of various Evangelical Protestant free churches , and due to recent immigration, there are now some 100,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians and 92,000 Roman Catholics living in Sweden.The first Muslim congregation was established in 1949, when a small contingent of Tatars migrated from Finland. Islam's presence in Sweden remained marginal until the 1960s, when Sweden started to receive migrants from the Balkans and Turkey. Further immigration from North Africa and the Middle East have brought the estimated Muslim population to 600,000. However, only about 110,000 were members of a congregation around 2010.According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 18 of Swedish citizens responded that they believe there is a god . 45 answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force . 34 answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force .According to a Demoskop study in 2015, the beliefs of the Swedish showed that 21 believed in a god . 16 believed in ghosts. 14 believed in creationism or intelligent design.Sociology professor Phil Zuckerman claims that Swedes, despite a lack of belief in God, commonly question the term atheist, preferring to call themselves Christians while being content with remaining in the Church of Sweden. Religion continues to play a role in Swedish cultural identity. This is evidenced by the fact that the majority of Swedish adults continue to remain members of the Lutheran Church despite having to pay a church tax; moreover, rates of baptism remain high and church weddings are increasing in Sweden.  Health  Healthcare in Sweden is mainly tax funded, universal for all citizens, and decentralised, although private health care also exists. The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by regional councils and municipalities. A total of 21 councils are in charge of primary and hospital care within the country. Private healthcare is a rarity in Sweden, and even those private institutions work under the mandated city councils. The city councils regulates the rules and the establishment of potential private practices. While care for the elderly or those who need psychiatric help is conducted privately in many other countries, in Sweden, publicly funded local authorities are in charge of this type of care.Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low infant mortality. It also ranks high in life expectancy and in safe drinking water. In 2018, health and medical care represented around 11 of GDP.  Education  Children aged 1 5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public kindergarten . Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the Programme for International Student Assessment , Swedish 15 year old pupils score close to the OECD average. After completing the ninth grade, about 90 of the students continue with a three year upper secondary school , which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes. The Swedish government treats public and independent schools equally by introducing education vouchers in 1992 as one of the first countries in the world after the Netherlands. Anyone can establish a for profit school and the municipality must pay new schools the same amount as municipal schools get. School lunch is free for all students in Sweden, and providing breakfast is also encouraged.There are a number of different universities and colleges in Sweden, the oldest and largest of which are situated in Uppsala, Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm. In 2000, 32 of Swedish people held a tertiary degree, making the country fifth in the OECD in that category. Along with several other European countries, the government also subsidises tuition of international students pursuing a degree at Swedish institutions, although a recent bill passed in the Riksdag will limit this subsidy to students from EEA countries and Switzerland.The large influx of immigrants to Swedish schools has been cited as a significant part of the reason why Sweden has dropped more than any other European country in the international PISA rankings.  Immigration  In recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration, ending after World War I, to a nation of net immigration, from World War II onwards. In recent years the country has received a massive influx of refugees and immigrants mainly due to the Syrian war which broke out in 2015. Sweden received more refugees per capita than anywhere else in Europe. In 2015 alone a record breaking 163,000 people applied for asylum to a country of barely 10 million people. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non immigrants, settlement patterns, effects on upward social mobility, crime, and voting behaviour. There are no exact numbers on the ethnic background of migrants and their descendants in Sweden because the Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity. This is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' national backgrounds, which are recorded. Immigrants in Sweden are mostly concentrated in the urban areas of Svealand and G taland. Since the early 1970s, immigration to Sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in Asia and Latin America. In 2019, Sweden granted 21,958 people asylum, up from 21,502 in 2018.In 2021 one in five people in Sweden were born abroad. The ten largest groups of foreign born persons in the Swedish civil registry in 2021 were from: Syria Iraq Finland Poland Iran Somalia Afghanistan Former Yugoslavia Bosnia and Herzegovina Turkey According to an official investigation by The Swedish Pensions Agency on order from the government, the immigration to Sweden will double the state's expenses for pensions to the population. The total immigration to Sweden for 2017 will be roughly 180,000 people, and after that 110,000 individuals every year.  Culture  Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including August Strindberg, Astrid Lindgren, and Nobel Prize winners Selma Lagerl f and Harry Martinson. In total seven Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded to Swedes. The nation's most well known artists are painters such as Carl Larsson and Anders Zorn, and the sculptors Tobias Sergel and Carl Milles. Swedish 20th century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sj str m. In the 1920s 1980s, the filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and actors Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman became internationally noted people within cinema. More recently, the films of Lukas Moodysson, Lasse Hallstr m, and Ruben stlund have received international recognition. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the sexual revolution , with gender equality having particularly been promoted. The early Swedish film I Am Curious  reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the Swedish sin that had been introduced earlier in the US with Ingmar Bergman's Summer with Monika. The image of hot love and cold people emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of modernisation process that by breaking down traditional borders would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love, which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of m l. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its registered partnership laws and fully replaced them with gender neutral marriage, Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same sex and opposite sex couples. Cohabitation by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as elderly couples, is widespread. As of 2009, Sweden is experiencing a baby boom.  Music  Historical re creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the lur , simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. Sweden has a significant folk music scene. The joik, a type of Sami music, is a chant that is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality. Notable composers include Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald. Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition. Out of a population of 9.5 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs.In 2007, with over 800 million dollars in revenue, Sweden was the third largest music exporter in the world and surpassed only by the US and the UK. According to one source 2013, Sweden produces the most chart hits per capita in the world, followed by the UK and the USA. Sweden has a rather lively jazz scene. During the last sixty years or so it has attained a remarkably high artistic standard, stimulated by domestic as well as external influences and experiences. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research has published an overview of jazz in Sweden by Lars Westin.  Architecture  Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the countryside. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm and Helsingborg. Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The Skara Cathedral is of bricks from the 14th century, and the Uppsala Cathedral in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the Link ping Cathedral were made, the material was there limestone, but the building took some 250 years to finish. Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at Borgholm Castle, Halltorps Manor and Eketorp fortress on the island land, the Nyk ping fortress and the Visby city wall. Around 1520 Sweden was out of the Middle Ages and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include Kalmar Castle, Gripsholm Castle and the one at Vadstena. In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by Baroque architecture and later the rococo. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the Drottningholm Palace. 1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of Functionalism, or funkis as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the Million Programme, offering affordable living in large apartment complexes. The Ericsson Globe, located in Stockholm, is the largest hemispherical building on Earth. Its dome has a diameter of 110 metres and took two and a half years to build.  Media  Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are Dagens Nyheter , G teborgs Posten , Svenska Dagbladet and Sydsvenska Dagbladet . The two largest evening tabloids are Aftonbladet and Expressen . The ad financed, free international morning paper, Metro International, was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, The Local .The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954, and a third opened 1962, in response to pirate radio stations. Non profit community radio was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started. The licence funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, TV2, was launched in 1969. These two channels held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was TV3 which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by Kanal 5 in 1989 and TV4 in 1990. In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the terrestrial network. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country. Around half the population are connected to cable television. Digital terrestrial television in Sweden started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.  Literature  The first literary text from Sweden is the R k runestone, carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the Middle Ages, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the Old Swedish from that period. Swedish literature only began to flourish when the language was standardised during the 16th century. This standardisation was largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so called Gustav Vasa Bible. With improved education and the freedom brought by secularisation, the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include Georg Stiernhielm , who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; Johan Henric Kellgren , the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman , the first writer of burlesque ballads; and August Strindberg , a socio realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerl f, , Verner von Heidenstam and P r Lagerkvist . In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist Henning Mankell and the writer of spy fiction Jan Guillou. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about Pippi Longstocking, Emil, and others. In 2008, the second best selling fiction author in the world was Stieg Larsson, whose Millennium series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim. Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.  Holidays  Apart from traditional Protestant Christian holidays, Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre Christian tradition. They include Midsummer celebrating the summer solstice; Walpurgis Night on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or May Day on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver of light Saint Lucia, 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month long Christmas season. 6 June is the National Day of Sweden and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are official flag flying day observances and a Namesdays in Sweden calendar. In August many Swedes have kr ftskivor . Martin of Tours Eve is celebrated in Scania in November with M rten G s parties, where roast goose and svartsoppa are served. The Sami, one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.  Cuisine  Swedish cuisine, like that of the other Nordic countries , was traditionally simple. Fish , meat, potatoes and dairy products played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam; pancakes; pyttipanna, a spiced fried hash of meat and potatoes originally meant to use up any leftovers of meat; lutfisk; and the sm rg sbord, or lavish buffet. Akvavit is a popular alcoholic distilled beverage, and the drinking of snaps is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry crisp bread has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the surstr mming in northern Sweden and eel in southern Sweden. Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, are still an important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes. In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, kr ftskiva, Swedes eat large amounts of crayfish boiled with dill.  Cinema  Swedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and Max von Sydow. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallstr m.  Fashion  Interest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country headquarters famous brands like Hennes Mauritz , J. Lindeberg , Acne, Lindex, Odd Molly, Cheap Monday, Gant, WESC, Filippa K, and Nakkna within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.  Sports  Sport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities. The two main spectator sports are football and ice hockey. Second to football, horse sports have the highest number of practitioners. Thereafter, golf, orienteering, gymnastics, track and field, and the team sports of ice hockey, handball, floorball, basketball and bandy are the most popular in terms of practitioners.The Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as Tre Kronor , is regarded as one of the best in the world. The team has won the World Championships nine times, placing them third in the all time medal count. Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in 1994 and 2006. In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The Swedish national men's football team has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994. Sweden hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics, Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics and the FIFA World Cup in 1958. Other big sports events include the UEFA Euro 1992, 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, 1995 World Championships in Athletics, UEFA Women's Euro 2013, and several championships of ice hockey, curling, athletics, skiing, bandy, figure skating and swimming. In 2016, the Swedish Poker Federation joined The International Federation of Poker .

            "text": "The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is the cathedral of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. It is at 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, between West 110th Street and West 113th Street. The cathedral is an unfinished building, with only two thirds of the proposed building completed, due to several major stylistic changes and work interruptions. The original design, in the Byzantine Revival and Romanesque Revival styles, began construction in 1892. After the opening of the crossing in 1909, the overall plan was changed to a Gothic Revival design. The completion of the nave was delayed until 1941 due to various funding shortfalls, and little progress has occurred since then, except for an addition to the tower at the nave's southwest corner. After a large fire damaged part of the cathedral in 2001, it was renovated and rededicated in 2008. The towers above the western elevation of the facade, as well as the southern transept and a proposed steeple above the crossing, have not been completed. Despite being incomplete, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine is the world's sixth largest church by area and either the largest or second largest Anglican cathedral. The floor area of St. John's is 121,000 sq ft , spanning a length of 601 feet , while the roof height of the nave is 177 feet . Since the cathedral's interior is so large, it has been used for hundreds of events and art exhibitions. In addition, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has been involved in various advocacy initiatives throughout its history. The cathedral close includes numerous buildings: the Leake Watts Orphan Asylum Building, the cathedral proper, the St. Faith's House, the Choir School, the Deanery, and the Bishop's House. The buildings are designed in several different styles and were built over prolonged periods of construction, with the Leake Watts Orphan Asylum predating the cathedral itself. The cathedral close was collectively designated an official city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2017.  History   Context   Site  The neighborhood of Morningside Heights was thinly settled in the 17th century by the Dutch, then by the British. It remained rural through the mid 19th century, with two exceptions. The first was the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, no longer extant, which opened on the site of the Columbia University campus near 116th Street in 1821. The other was Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum, bounded by 110th Street to the south and 113th Street to the north, which later became the current cathedral site. The Leake and Watts asylum was incorporated in 1831 under act of the New York State Legislature, and three years later, 25 acres land at the corner of Bloomingdale Road and 110th Street was purchased from the Bloomingdale Asylum. The initial plans for the asylum were drawn up by Ithiel Town, but were revised several times to keep the costs within the asylum's budget. The cornerstone of the asylum was laid in 1838, and it was completed in 1843.  Need for a cathedral  Meanwhile, the Episcopal Diocese of New York started to grow in the early 19th century: there were 26 Episcopal parishes in the city by 1800, and a decade later, that number had nearly doubled to 50. In 1828, the first proposal for a grand cathedral for the diocese was made by Bishop John Henry Hobart, who proposed a site near Washington Square Park. The church would be called the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, or St. John's Cathedral for short, after the Revelation by John of Patmos . The plans were canceled because of objections over erecting such a large building for the diocese, a derivative of the Church of England, even as many New Yorkers still harbored resentment over the American Revolutionary War.In 1873, a cathedral board of trustees was established under Bishop Horatio Potter. The board decided on property just south of Central Park, bounded by 59th Street to the north and 57th Street to the south. However, the purchase was canceled after the would be donors lost their savings in the Panic of 1873. Yet another plot of land, at Eighth Avenue and 74th Street, was offered to the church in 1882, but rejected due to the high cost of acquisition. By 1890, there were 40,000 Episcopalians in Manhattan, and Episcopalians made up the largest bloc of Protestants in the borough. Furthermore, many imposing institutions were being built in New York City, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall, Metropolitan Opera House, and the American Museum of Natural History.  Planning   Site selection  When Henry C. Potter, Horatio Potter's nephew, became the Diocese of New York's assistant bishop in 1883, he convened the trustees to look for an alternate site. On June 1, 1887, Henry Potter publicly announced his intention to build St. John's, though the exact location was still to be determined. Potter described the planned cathedral as an American Westminster Abbey that would rival the Catholic St. Patrick's Cathedral in Midtown Manhattan. In his announcement, Potter called on New Yorkers to give funds toward the new cathedral, which was expected to cost 10 million. The plans for the cathedral were well received by both Protestants and non Protestants, as well as the media and other denominational leaders. The donors included the wealthy Astor, Vanderbilt, and Belmont families. Additionally, the Barberini family's tapestries were gifted to the cathedral in 1891.Numerous sites in Manhattan were examined for the new cathedral's location, and by 1889, the Leake and Watts Asylum between 110th and 113th Streets had been chosen as the site for the future site of St. John's. News media such as The New York Times and Uptown Visitor praised the decision, as the site was located on a high point overlooking Central and Morningside Parks. The committee had wanted to build slightly further north, on a more elevated plot between 116th Street to the south and 119th Street to the north. However, that plot would be too difficult to acquire, as ownership of that tract was divided among several entities; by contrast, the Leake and Watts Asylum had full control over their entire city block. The 11.5 acre asylum site was deeded to the cathedral in October 1891, and the asylum moved to Westchester County, New York. The asylum site was then acquired for 850,000. At the time, Morningside Heights was quickly being developed as a residential neighborhood surrounded by numerous higher education institutions. The proposed cathedral's elevated location would have been visible from New Jersey, across the Hudson River to the west, as well as from the New York Bay to the south.  Architecture competition  Simultaneously, there was also debate over the new cathedral's style; because of the larger plot and more remote location from Midtown Manhattan it was expected to be more elaborate than St. Patrick's. The trustees had formed a Committee on Architecture in conjunction with William Robert Ware, a Columbia architecture professor, which held a design competition for St. John that involved several prominent architectural firms. Though everyone was free to enter the competition, fourteen firms and architects were paid 500 each to create designs for the cathedral. The deadline for each plan was January 1889.That May, the board of trustees formed a committee to review the more than 60 designs that had been submitted. Many of the competitors were American, though only four were experienced in cathedral construction. The board members then discussed the designs privately; some architects expressed concerns about the secret consultations, since the trustees generally did not have knowledge of architectural design. The competition was narrowed down to four finalists. Namely, these were Gerona by William A. Potter and R. H. Robertson; Three Arabesque Scrolls within a Circle by George L. Heins and Christopher Grant LaFarge with William Winthrop Kent; AMDG by George M. Huss and J. H. Buck; and Jerusalem the Golden by William Halsey Wood. Gerona used the Gothic style based on Spanish cathedrals; AMDG and Jerusalem the Golden were in a regular Gothic style, and Three Arabesque Scrolls was mainly Byzantine.Potter and Robertson were the only one of the four finalists who had significant experience at the time, and the trustees had agreed not to release any designs without the consent of all competitors, although some contestants broke the agreement anyway by revealing their designs to the media. The finalists were given more than a year to refine the details of their plans: the original deadline was set for February 1890, but was later extended to November after a failed proposal to host the World's Columbian Exposition in Morningside Park. The submissions were placed in public view in April 1891. By then, the public was losing interest in the competition, and the finalist designs mainly received negative criticism.  Plan selected  In July 1891, the plan selection committee chose Heins LaFarge's plan as the winning proposal. The design had been the trustees' second choice; although the trustees liked Potter and Robertson's plan more, W. A. Potter was the bishop's half brother and the trustees did not want to be accused of nepotism. To Kent's consternation, he was initially not recognized as a co collaborator, and would not be acknowledged as such until the following year. The group's blueprints called for chapels and end sections with apses; a crossing containing four round arches as well as a dome topped by a massive tower; and transepts with round edges. The interior was based upon Boston's Trinity Church, and the crossing was based upon Istanbul's Hagia Sophia, Venice's St. Mark's Basilica, and the P rigueux Cathedral. The exotic design was seen as an example of the unusual architecture that was prevalent at that time. It was also Heins LaFarge's first major commission: the firm later designed structures such as the Astor Court buildings at the Bronx Zoo, as well as the early stations of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, the first operator of the present day New York City Subway.That October, the trustees directed the firm to revise their design further. The following month, it was announced that work would begin in early 1892, provided that Heins LaFarge submitted their revised plans that April. The original plans were then substantially revised because the board of trustees wanted a Gothic style appearance. The western towers were modified to remove the spires and enlarge the windows, and various Gothic details were placed on the facade. The nave was realigned from north south to east west so that the apse would face east, in the direction of the sunrise, to represent the resurrection of Jesus as per Episcopal tradition. Heins LaFarge objected to the realignment because it would result in the cathedral being hidden behind other buildings. In the final plan, Three Arabesque Scrolls incorporated both Byzantine and Romanesque influences, with Gothic detailing on the exterior. Outwardly, the design resembled the AMDG plan from Huss Buck. By April 1892, the trustees had raised much of the 850,000 required for land acquisition, though there still remained a deficit of 175,000.  Construction and early years  Construction on the Cathedral of St. John the Divine was begun with the cornerstone laying ceremony on December 27, 1892, St. John's Day. One thousand tickets for seats at the ceremony were distributed, though the actual attendance was 1,100. The cornerstone contained various objects such as a Bible and church papers. Potter hit the stone three times with a mallet and said Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid which is Jesus Christ. The following month, the remaining 175,000 for land acquisition had been secured, and the trustees moved to take title to the land, including the cathedral close around the cathedral's main building, in April. Unlike the main building, the cathedral close was not designed under a single master plan, and during the 1890s and 1900s, several proposals would be made for the site.  Initial construction  Actual work on St. John's began in early 1893. The trustees initially expected that work would proceed quickly because much of the Morningside Heights plateau was made of shallow bedrock. However, in September 1893, builders unexpectedly hit pockets of soft shale and an underground spring at several locations about 40 feet below ground. One of these pockets was located directly below the site for one of the four piers that were to support the cathedral's massive 445 foot stone tower. The trustees briefly considered moving the entire cathedral slightly southward. They ultimately decided against moving the cathedral, believing it to be inauspicious if the cornerstone were to be moved. Instead, builders drilled several deep shafts until they hit the bedrock, then poured concrete pits within each shaft. The pits would then accommodate the construction of the tower's piers. The pits were completed in late 1895 at a significantly higher cost than originally estimated.By 1898, St. John's had cost an estimated 750,000, and as per an 1896 estimate, the cathedral was projected to cost at least 5 million when complete. As a temporary measure, the Tiffany Chapel was purchased in mid 1898 so that services could be held there. The chapel was placed in the crypt, within the basement. The first services were held in January 1899 within the Tiffany Chapel. The crossing arches, located in the cathedral plot's eastern portion, were completed the following year, though three of the arches were temporarily sealed off until the transepts and nave could be completed. By then, some 2 million had already been spent, even though little appeared to have been completed. Despite large donations from prominent figures such as financiers John Jacob Astor IV and William Waldorf Astor, governor Levi P. Morton, banker J. P. Morgan, and businessman Cornelius Vanderbilt, the trustees continued to raise funds.In March 1903, the trustees announced that the next stage of St. John's construction would require 500,000 for building the choir and 200,000 for completing the loft, and that eight massive granite columns would need to be procured to support the roof over the choir. Furthermore, the trustees would build three arches to support the rest of the roof. The choir columns, sourced from Vinalhaven, Maine, were each 54 feet tall with a 6 foot diameter. At the time, they were the world's second largest stone columns, but because of their size, three of the columns were cracked while being turned. The columns were then transported using a specially constructed barge towed by the large steam tug Clara Clarita. When the columns arrived at Manhattan in July and August 1903, they were rolled onto flatbed trucks and brought to the cathedral's site. Since the builders did not have a derrick that was strong enough to lift the column pieces, they placed another order for wood to build a strong enough derrick. The columns were finally lifted in July 1904, more than a year after the initial announcement. The walls could not be placed until after the columns had been installed. Work also began in 1903 on the crossing ceiling, which was to contain Guastavino tiles designed by Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino.The board of trustees implemented a new charter in early 1904, which provided for greater representation of laypeople on the board. By 1905, with 800,000 available for construction, the trustees anticipated that the cathedral would be completed within a decade. The church's great organ was ordered the following year at a cost of 50,000, following a gift by the Morton family. Work also continued on the exterior walls of the choir and the seven surrounding chapels in the apse, which required 100,000 short tons of granite. Builders estimated that 300,000 short tons of stone would have been used for the walls once work was completed. Gutzon Borglum was commissioned for some of the initial sculptural elements on St. John's, though his relation with the trustees was strained: he destroyed two angels after criticism of his work and threatened to quit in 1906. Because of the delays in construction, members of the public began to question the necessity of constructing such a large cathedral. With little progress to show for, public sentiment began to turn against the cathedral. Even the trustees started to have doubts about certain aspects of the plan, criticizing Heins LaFarge's small staff, their simultaneous involvement in many other projects, slow construction, and cost overruns.  Crossing opening and change in design  Although Heins died in 1907, LaFarge continued to design the crossing, choir, and apse of St. John's. By then, the architectural preferences of the public were shifting away from the original design. Additionally, communication between LaFarge and the trustees were deteriorating, with several trustees calling for LaFarge's removal. The choir was covered in 1908, and the crossing was installed the next year. The choir was nearly complete by October 1909, but there were insufficient funds to complete its construction, delaying its opening by at least six months. At that time, St. John's was earning about 24,000 per year and had a 500,000 endowment, while at least 1 million was needed to complete construction. In March 1911, trustees finally confirmed an opening date of April 19, 1911. The first service in the choir and crossing, the consecration of the choir, occurred as scheduled on that day. The completed portions of the cathedral were widely praised, though few newspapers devoted extensive coverage to the event, except the New York Herald.A month after the choir's consecration, the trustees suddenly fired LaFarge, commissioning Ralph Adams Cram to take LaFarge's place as lead architect of St. John's. The trustees had exercised a clause in their contract with Heins LaFarge, enabling them to hire another architect if either partner were to die. LaFarge was not made aware of the matter beforehand, and was only notified via a cable sent by his partner Benjamin Wistar Morris. The original Byzantine Romanesque design was changed to a Gothic design, and Cram was asked to convert many existing features to Gothic style. The move was criticized in the local media, who claimed that the trustees and Cram had been conspiring to eject LaFarge from the lead architect position. However, The New York Sun reported that Cram had only reluctantly accepted the commission because the trustees had threatened to hire a foreign architect otherwise.Cram presented a master plan for the cathedral close's buildings in October 1911, and his revised designs for the main structure were completed in 1913. Regardless, there was still not enough money to complete the cathedral's construction, as the New York Episcopal Diocese Cathedral League had mentioned in 1912 that 5.5 million was still needed. The diocese was able to construct several structures to the south of the main building , as part of a plan that had been approved by the trustees in late 1911. These structures included the St. Faith's House , Synod House , Cathedral School , and Cathedral House .  Nave and north transept  By January 1916, Bishop David H. Greer announced that the diocese would construct St. John's nave and narthex, along with a pair of towers on the western elevation of the facade above the narthex. The project would cost 1.5 million, even though St, John's only had about 200,000 on hand as of June 1915. A groundbreaking ceremony for the nave was held on May 8, 1916. That November, construction stopped due to material and funding shortages during World War I, and the trustees had decided against raising funds until after the war. Cram edited his plans in the interim. In February 1919, the trustees approved Cram's revised plan to incorporate a memorial for soldiers. The new plans required 5 6 million, but would make St. John's the third or fourth largest worldwide. The cathedral did not yet have the money to build the nave, and furthermore, in 1920 the trustees decided not to hold fundraising drives for said purpose. Because of an unstable economy, work did not resume for another four years, though both Greer and Bishop Charles Sumner Burch supported the project.In 1923, Burch's successor William T. Manning announced a 15 million capital campaign to raise money for this project. The New York campaign committee, headed by then governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, campaigned from 1923 to 1925 to raise 6 million . By May 1924, Manning announced that 2.5 million had been donated within the previous three months, and that work on the nave would soon begin if that rate of donation were to continue. St. John's was seeking price estimates for the nave's construction by that November, and the baptistery was donated the same year. Some 7.7 million had been raised by February 1925, and the laying of the nave's cornerstone occurred on November 9, 1925. Manning wanted the cathedral to be an interdenominational place of worship, but was still reluctant to add other denominations' members to the board of trustees. Notably, Manning rejected a request from John D. Rockefeller Jr., a Baptist, despite the latter's 500,000 donation toward the cathedral's building fund.In January 1927, Manning announced that the trustees had approved Cram's proposal for a square tower above the crossing; the tower would replace the dome, which did not conform to the Gothic style. With sides of 60 feet , the tower would be half as wide as the arches below it. Cram's blueprint revisions, published in 1929, entailed building the 300 foot tall square tower over the crossing, and adding two portals to the western elevation. Additionally, St. John's northern transept began construction in December 1927. Since the funds for that transept were donated solely by women, it was called the Women's Transept. Work on the Women's Transept was halted in October 1930 due to a lack of funds. Construction at St. John's was otherwise unaffected by the Great Depression. During this duration, work was concentrated mainly on the western elevation.When construction of the Women's Transept resumed in 1934, the nave and the western elevation were nearly complete except for the two towers above the western facade, but work on the crossing tower and south transept had yet to commence. By 1938, the nave was completed, but the temporary construction wall between the nave and crossing was still in place because the Byzantine Romanesque crossing's design had yet to be harmonized with the Gothic nave. As such, Cram subsequently replaced the portions of the ceiling above the choir and the apse's eastern section. Additionally, the nave started to be used for services, even though it had not yet been dedicated. The 1939 WPA Guide to New York City stated that 20 million had been spent on the cathedral by then.  Full length opening and expansion  The full 601 foot length of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine was opened for the first time on November 30, 1941. At that time, St. John's was only three fifths completed, yet it was the second largest Christian church in the world by area, behind only St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The event was commemorated with a week long celebration. The last day of the celebrations, Sunday December 7, 1941, coincided with the Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. With the consequent entry of the United States into World War II, work on the cathedral stopped. The southern transept and tower had yet to start, while the northern transept remained one third complete. The western towers, planned to be 266 feet , reached only to the roof of the nave. Cram revised his plans yet again just before his 1942 death, this time with shorter western towers and a slim spire in place of the square tower over the crossing.  Halt in construction  Following the end of World War II, St. John's did not experience any more new construction for three decades. In 1945, Manning had attempted to start a fundraising drive for 10 million so that the remaining funds could be raised for the cathedral's completion. However, during the late 1940s, his successor Bishop Charles Kendall Gilbert turned efforts toward alleviating social issues in the vicinity of the cathedral. Rather than being focused on expansion, the cathedral became more involved in the surrounding community. By that time, a total of 19 million had been spent on construction . By the 1950s, there was debate over whether to complete St. John's in the Gothic fashion of the nave; a more contemporary style; or the original Byzantine Romanesque style. Several plans were proposed through the early 1960s, but none were examined in depth.In 1966, it was announced that work at St. John's would resume. The trustees had approved a smaller version of the western towers and the crossing, with a modern multicolored dome to be built atop the crossing. The project did not proceed, as Bishop Horace W. B. Donegan said that such work would not occur during his administration; rather, he wanted the construction money to instead go toward helping the poor. In the 1970s, the cathedral's activities turned toward improving quality of life in Morningside Heights; helping the elderly, young, and the environment; and participating in the civil rights movement and the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. However, when the Very Reverend James Parks Morton was installed as St. John's dean in 1973, he said that construction at St. John's would start again. Morton said he wanted St. John's to become a holy place for the whole city . St. John's had become overcrowded because of its increasing focus on community activities, and even though the cathedral was losing 500,000 each year, Morton believed that an expansion would help make space for these extra activities.  Resumption of work  Morton announced in December 1978 that construction would soon begin on constructing the two western towers, extending their height by 150 feet and bringing their total height to 291 feet . The job was expected to cost 20 million and take five years. However, by then, there was a shortage of qualified stone carvers in the area. James R. Bambridge, who was hired as the stonemason, planned to employ unskilled younger workers from the surrounding community. Bambridge hired Nicholas G. Fairplay, an English stonemason, as master carver. The architect was Hoyle, Doran and Berry, the successor to Cram's architecture firm. The expansions would be based primarily on Cram's revised designs, published before his death. The north transept would be completed, but would remain separate from the main building.Work on the western facade's towers was restarted with the opening of St. John's stone yard, the Cathedral Stoneworks, which received its first several Indiana limestone blocks in June 1979. Construction started first on the south tower, named for Saint Paul, which began to rise in 1982. However, the project continued to be delayed due to a shortage of funds, and due to slow development of the towers' designs. Work also progressed slowly because the stonemasons were carving a myriad of minute details on the south tower. By 1984, St. John's was projected to be complete in 2000. Under the leadership of master stone carvers Nicholas Fairplay, Simon Verity, and Jean Claude Marchionni, work on the statuary of the central portal of the cathedral's western elevation was started in 1988 and completed in 1997. During this era, the cathedral expanded its cultural programming, hosting some 140 shows and performances in the 1987 1988 season, some of which drew up to 3,000 observers.By 1992, the construction budget had been depleted; work was halted, and the stone yard was closed. By then, another 50 feet of height had been added to the south tower. While some of the scaffolding was removed, other portions remained, rusting away for fifteen years. The Very Reverend Harry H. Pritchett Jr., who succeeded Morton in 1997, decided against further expansion of St. John's, especially since the existing facilities needed 20 40 million in repairs.  21st century  On December 18, 2001, a fire swept through the unfinished north transept, destroying the gift shop and damaging tapestries. Despite the damage sustained, St. John's reopened two weeks later. Though the pipe organ was not damaged, all its pipes and other component parts were removed and restored. Valuable tapestries and other items in the cathedral were damaged by the smoke. In January 2005, the cathedral began a major restoration to not only remove smoke damage resulting from the 2001 fire, but also clean the 80 years of dirt accumulation in the nave. The renovations temporarily depleted St. John's funds: the unaffected portions of the cathedral started to deteriorate, staff salary raises were deferred, and several staff positions were eliminated. The scaffolding around the south tower was removed in 2007, and the cathedral was rededicated on November 30, 2008.The cathedral's main building was made a city landmark in June 2003, but the designation was overturned that October, since it did not cover the entire cathedral close. At the same time, St. John's officials wanted to lease out the lots at the northern and southern borders of the cathedral close for further development, a move that preservationists unsuccessfully attempted to prevent. Ultimately, two residential buildings were erected on these lots: Avalon Morningside Park on the southern lot and the Enclave on the northern lot. In 2017, the cathedral close was re designated a city landmark, except for the two new residential buildings. The next year, the first phase of the north transept's renovation was finally completed, and work began on a renovation of the crypt.On April 14, 2019, a small fire occurred in the crypt; except for smoke damage, the cathedral building was mostly unaffected. Many artworks stored in the crypt were reportedly damaged or destroyed in the fire. An initial cleaning removed smoke damage from the bottom 10 feet of the interior of the cathedral. A cleaning of the rest of the interior was also ongoing. Also in 2019, Ennead Architects proposed erecting a copper dome above the crossing so that the crossing's tiles could be rehabilitated. On December 13, 2020, following the end of a choir performance outside the cathedral, a man fired guns at the crowd and was fatally shot by police; nobody else was injured.  Main structure  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is located at 1047 Amsterdam Avenue in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, between West 110th Street to the south and 113th Street to the north. The cathedral's main entrance on the west is along the same axis as 112th Street. Adjacent sites include Mount Sinai Morningside to the north, Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus to the north and west, and Morningside Park to the east. One of the key reasons for St. John's location is that the land under it was described as the highest point in Manhattan . One author wrote that the view from outside tells much about St. John's inner spirit , saying that the southeastern elevation of the facade gives an impression of incompleteness, while the great western elevation was vitalized by its incipience .St. John's is oriented west east relative to the street grid and was originally supposed to have a cruciform plan, with transepts extending to the north and south of the crossing near the eastern end of the cathedral. The entire structure measures 601 feet long. From west to east, the cathedral contains a narthex measuring 50 feet long by 207 feet wide; a nave of 248 by 146 feet ; a crossing of 100 by 100 feet ; a choir of 145 by 56 feet ; and the Chapel of St. Savior in the apse, measuring 58 feet with an ambulatory 14 feet wide. The cathedral's western elevation is 207 feet wide; if the transepts had been completed, they would have measured 330 feet from end to end. The cathedral has an interior floor area of 121,000 square feet and can host 8,600 people. As of 2017, these dimensions make St. John's the sixth largest Christian cathedral in the world, and puts it in competition with Liverpool Cathedral as being the world's largest Anglican cathedral.The original design for the cathedral was created by Heins LaFarge. Despite being primarily Byzantine and Romanesque in influence, the last version of Heins LaFarge's design contained a significantly Gothic style appearance. The original plan at St. John's called for tiled arch domes and barrel vaults. The crossing was to be held up by four round arches under a dome, with a tower on top. The completed cathedral was supposed to have been 520 feet long and 290 feet wide between transepts, while the tower would have been 450 feet tall.The modern plan for the building, as it appeared upon its official opening in 1941, conforms primarily to the second design campaign from the prolific Gothic Revival architect Ralph Adams Cram. The plans are based on the French Gothic style, with English Gothic accents. Cram had initially wanted to use English Gothic models, which typically placed less emphasis on vertical elements and height, and which contrasted with the extant parts of the cathedral. Cram's plan originally called for three main entrances; two 500 foot spires set back from the western facade; two smaller spires on the western facade. Inside were ten full height aisles, with a triforium and clerestory rising to the ceiling, as well as large chapels along each side of the nave. The design provides a transition between the nave and the crossing, because the nave was to be 50 feet wide, about half the width of the crossing. Cram, described as a brilliant perfectionist , frequently revised his proposal and later spoke of Heins LaFarge's plans as better than his own. One major change, published in 1926, called for a 300 foot tall , square tower above the crossing and five portals on the western elevation. Another revision was published just before he died in 1942, and called for a spire above the crossing. Cram's designs were not fully built, either. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine remains only two thirds complete and is often nicknamed St. John the Unfinished.  Narthex and western facade   Narthex  The narthex, in the westernmost portion of the cathedral facing Amsterdam Avenue, was designed by Cram. His original plans did not include a narthex, instead showing the nave continuing as far as the western facade. Inside the narthex is a large vestibule, which serves as an entrance to the nave on the east. The vestibule measures 180 feet along the north south axis and 85 feet along the west east axis. The southern part of the narthex contains the cathedral's gift shop.Above the narthex are two towers: one named for Saint Peter to the north and the other named for Saint Paul to the south. The north tower reaches to the roof of the nave, which is 177 feet above ground level; the south tower is about 50 feet taller, with the additional height having been built between 1982 and 1992. If the towers had been completed, they would have been about 266 feet tall. The towers protrude slightly from the northern and southern elevations of the facade but are flush with the western elevation. On the northern and southern facades of the narthex, at the base of the towers, are stained glass windows, one on each side.  Western facade  The narthex abuts the unfinished western elevation of the facade facing Amsterdam Avenue; this facade is 207 feet wide and consists of five architectural bays. The bays are separated by large arched buttresses with finials at their tops, and they contain niches for the possible future installation of statues. The western elevation is divided into four vertical tiers. From bottom to top, they are the ground level portals, on the first tier; the gallery level, on the second tier; the large rose window and several smaller grisaille and lancet windows, on the third tier; and the top of the south tower and the gable above the center bay, on the fourth tier.At ground level, there are five portals under arched openings. The largest of those is the center portal, called the Portal of Paradise, which contains carvings of the transfiguration of Jesus as well as St. John and 32 biblical characters; these were carved in 1988 under Simon Verity's leadership. St. John is depicted on the trumeau, or vertical pier, between the two pairs of doors within the center portal. The center portal also contains depictions of New York City skyscrapers being destroyed in an apocalypse. The center, northernmost, and southernmost portals are set within large, gabled structures with several archivolts, or arched moldings, surrounding each portal under the gables; porches overhang the portals above the gables. The other two portals are located under simple rectangular canopy structures, located underneath grisaille windows looking into the nave. Lights salvaged from the former Pennsylvania Station illuminate the steps in front of the portals.Above the center portal, between the towers, is a rose window installed by stained glass artist Charles Connick and constructed out of 10,000 pieces of glass. With a diameter of 40 feet , the rose window is the largest rose window in the U.S. Flanking the rose window on either side are two grisaille windows, each with two lancet windows under a smaller rose. The seven archangels are depicted in the north grisaille, while the seven churches of Asia are depicted in the south grisaille. Connick had designed the grisailles as well. On the gable above the large rose window, there are lancets as well as a medallion in the middle. The two pairs of great west doors on the western elevation, set beneath the elaborate center portal, were designed between 1927 and 1931 by the designer Henry Wilson. The bronze doors include a sequence of 60 relief panels, which presents scenes from the Old and New Testaments and the Apocalypse. The doors open three times per year: Easter; St. Francis's feast day in October; and the blessing of the bicycles in the spring. They comprise one of four bronze door commissions designed by Wilson before his death. St. John's great west doors were the last of the four commissions, each pair measuring some 18 by 12 feet . The remaining doors on the western elevation are composed of Burmese teak with wrought iron decoration.  Nave  The nave was designed by Cram, though the final plan is slightly modified from the original. It is oriented from west to east, measuring 248 feet long by 146 feet wide. The ceiling is 124 feet above ground level, but the ridge of the roof is 174 feet high. These dimensions are about the same as in the original plans, which called for floor dimensions of 260 by 150 feet . a 175 foot roof, and a 125 foot ceiling.On the northern and southern elevations, there are four vertical double bays , each with two columns of windows. Large arched buttresses, with two piers each, separate the different double bays; smaller buttresses, containing a single pier, divide each double bay into smaller sub bays . This alternation of large and small buttresses gives the appearance of four double bays with two sub bays each, rather than eight singular rectangular bays. At the arcade level, each of the sub bays contains an arrangement of stained glass with two lancet windows under a rose window. The sub bays also contain another stained glass arrangement at clerestory level, each with two lancet windows and one rose window. The clerestory arrangements each measure 45 feet long by 12 feet wide. Carved parapets, as well as gables with dormers, run along the copper roof.Inside, there are six north south rows of piers, three to either side of the nave. These piers divide the nave into five aisles running west to east, with the center aisle located on the same axis as 112th Street. There are four smaller aisles, two to either side of the center aisle. Additionally, the interior contains several flying buttresses, concealed by bridges that carry them over the outermost aisles.There are sixteen sub bays in the nave, eight on each side; the easternmost sub bays on either side contain doorways. Each of the bays are named after some aspect of humanity. From west to east, the sub bays along the northern side of the nave are named the Sports, Arts, Crusaders, Education, Lawyers, Ecclesiastical Origins , and Historical and Patriotic Societies' , and Fatherhood bays. The sub bays on the southern side are named the All Souls', Missionary, Labor, Press , Medical, Religious Life , Armed Forces , and Motherhood bays. Each of the sub bays contain carved parapets atop their mono pitched roofs. The sub bays are used for various exhibits. The iconography of the stained glass windows in the arcade and clerestory is related to the theme of each respective sub bay. In each sub bay, between the lower windows and the clerestory windows, is the triforium level, which contains two west east corridors with numerous windowless rooms and office spaces.  Apse  The apse, located at St. John's eastern end, is made up of numerous components. The center of the apse contains the choir, located below the great organ. Two ambulatory passages run adjacent to the choir, one to the north and the other to the south. Seven chapels, a baptistery, and a columbarium are also located in the northwestern part of the apse. The apse contains two sets of clerestory windows: the large ambulatory clerestories with multiple panels, as well as a smaller sanctuary clerestory window above each of the ambulatory clerestories. The apse's walls are supported by gabled buttresses, which are taller than the height of the walls, and contain niches with statues.  Choir  The choir was consecrated in 1911. It consists of two sets of wooden stalls facing each other, with three rows in each stall. The stalls were made by the Philadelphia based John Barber Company. The westernmost unit in the southern row of choir stalls is called the Dean's Stall . The roof above the choir is supported by eight columns, each 54 feet tall with a 6 foot diameter and a weight of 130 short tons . The columns' foundations descend as much as 130 feet into the bedrock below them.The parapets behind the two sections of the choir were originally installed in 1922 with twenty niches for statues of the spiritual heroes of the twenty centuries since the birth of Christ. For example, the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries are respectively represented by statues of William Shakespeare, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. The niche for the 20th century was left blank through the end of that century. In 2001 the choir parapet was completed with carvings of Martin Luther King Jr., Albert Einstein, Susan B. Anthony. and Mohandas Gandhi. In addition, the finials on both rows of stalls were carved by Otto Jahnsen and depict church music composers and performers.On the floor are tiles designed by the Grueby Faience Company, with geometric patterns and imagery reminiscent of the iconography in other cathedrals. A compass rose, the official icon of the Anglican Communion , is located on the floor between the two stalls, in the center of the choir.  Great Organ  The Great Organ was built by Ernest M. Skinner in 1906 1910. It is located above the choir on the north and south sides, and consists of four manual keyboards with several pedals. In 1954, it was enlarged by the Aeolian Skinner Organ Company, Opus 150 A, under the tonal direction of G. Donald Harrison. The organ contains 8,514 pipes, though it previously included 8,035. While most of the pipes are located above the choir stalls, the Great Organ also controls the State Trumpet, located beneath the rose window about 500 feet to the west.The 2001 fire in the north transept resulted in heavy smoke damage to the organ, and it was subsequently restored by Quimby Pipe Organs, Inc., of Warrensburg, Missouri. After two years of extensive and detailed refurbishment work, including a reorganization of many pipes and a rebuilding of the console, the organ finally returned to service in 2008 as part of an overall 41 million cleaning and repair to the cathedral. The Great Organ was damaged again in the April 2019 crypt fire, and was indefinitely placed out of service pending a thorough cleaning. While the Great Organ was being restored, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine used an electric organ.The organists have included: Walter Henry Hall Miles Farrow Norman Coke Jephcott John Upham  Alec Wyton David Pizzaro Paul Halley Dorothy Papadakos Timothy Brumfield Bruce Neswick Kent Tritle   Sanctuary  Behind the choir, to its east, is the sanctuary , a raised platform. The chancel includes the high altar, which is made of white Vermont marble. The Magna Carta Pedestal named as such because it is located atop three stones from the Bury St Edmunds Abbey in England is located to the right, while the sedilia for the bishop and other clergy is to the left. The sanctuary also contains the cathedra , donated by Olivia Egleston Phelps Stokes in memory of her sister Caroline Phelps Stokes. The bishop's pulpit is made of Tennessee marble, with five niches, each of which contain reliefs that depict scenes from the life of Christ. A presbytery, which houses the officiating clergy of St. John's, is located between the chancel and the choir. The reredos behind the sanctuary depicts four scenes from the Old Testament on the left , and four from the New Testament on the right .Behind the altar is a wrought iron enclosure. The space contains the English Gothic style tomb of the man who originally conceived and founded the cathedral, the Right Reverend Horatio Potter, which was dedicated in 1921.  Ambulatory and chapels  An ambulatory, measuring 250 feet long and 14 feet wide, surrounds the choir to the north, east, and south, making a rough U shape with the two ends of the U facing west. The floor is covered with red clay colored tiles that contain green serpentine borders. There are 30 foot tall wrought steel gates at either end of the ambulatory. Numerous plaques are present in the ambulatory, paying homage to large donors and other notable individuals in St. John's history. A poetry wall and several Madonna paintings are also located in the ambulatory, particularly in the southern part of the ambulatory.Extending outward from the ambulatory are seven chapels. These chapels are known as the Chapels of the Tongues , and all were donated by prominent individuals and families. The chapels were designed by four different architects and firms: Heins LaFarge designed two of the chapels, while Cram designed a third. The Chapels of the Tongues were devoted to seven of the city's largest immigrant groups when the apse was completed: the southernmost three chapels represent Latin races and the northernmost three chapels represent Germanic races . All of the chapels, except for St. Ansgar's, were donated by individuals or families. Clockwise from north, they are devoted to: St. Ansgar, patron of Denmark; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1918. St. Ansgar Chapel has its own organ. St. Boniface, apostle of the Germans; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1916. St. Columba, patron of Ireland and Scotland; designed by Heins LaFarge, dedicated 1911. St. Savior , devoted to immigrants from Africa and Asia; designed by Heins LaFarge, dedicated 1911. St. Savior was the first chapel to be complete, hosting its first services in 1904. It contains a bronze three paneled altar with gold leaf decoration, designed by Keith Haring just before his death. St. Martin of Tours, patron of the French; designed by Cram Ferguson, dedicated 1918. St. Ambrose, patron of Milan; designed by Carr re and Hastings, dedicated 1914. St. James, patron of Spain; designed by Henry Vaughan, dedicated 1916. St. James Chapel is the largest apsidal chapel, with a seating capacity of 25 people, and is frequently utilized for small funerals, weddings, or worship services. The chapel has its own choir and 857 pipe organ.The northwest corner of the apse, adjacent to the St. Ansgar Chapel, includes the octagonal baptistery. The baptistery was donated by three Stuyvesant family siblings in 1924. The space measures 31 feet in diameter with a ceiling 43 feet tall. The baptistery's iconography depicts the Stuyvesant family history; icons of New Amsterdam, New York, and Dutch history; and the 12 apostles.The columbarium, established in the 1970s, is in a room directly west of the baptistery. It contains marble vaults, which store the remains of people from all religions.  Crossing  Between the nave to the west and the apse to the east is the crossing, designed by Rafael Guastavino. The interior of the crossing includes four massive granite arches, which in the original Heins LaFarge design were originally intended to support the massive 445 foot tower above it. When completed in 1900, the arches were described as the crowning glory of Morningside Heights. During the time that the nave remained incomplete, temporary walls were placed within the arches so that services could be held in the crossing.Above the crossing is a domed roof, which was meant as a temporary covering until the tower above the crossing was built. It was completed within fifteen weeks between May and August 1909. The dome is shaped like a saucer, and consists of several overlapping layers of Guastavino tile, which support themselves around the dome's center upon their own weight. The pendentives, or triangular areas between the circular dome and the corners of the arches, are 1 inch thick; the thickness of the dome itself ranges from 4 inches on top to 7.5 inches at the bottom. Compared to conventional ceilings, the tiles saved money because they did not require temporary supports when they were installed. For added strength, metal rods were included in the dome's shell.The dome was originally intended to be temporary. Cram had proposed three plans for the structure above the crossing: a steeple, a square tower rising 500 feet above the crossing floor, and then a slim spire. None of these plans were realized. In 2019, Ennead Architects proposed to build a copper dome over the crossing so that the ceiling tiles could be renovated.  Basement  Directly below the crossing is the basement, which contains the crypt, now used as a storage area. The items stored in the crypt include artifacts such as pieces of the destroyed Pennsylvania Station and World Trade Center, as well as wooden angels, plaster gargoyles, leadlights, antique furniture, and a single file line of saints. The crypt also includes objects such as a large fossil and a massive crystal of quartz, both of which were relocated to the crypt after the 2001 fire. Along either side the basement are rooms, each named after the chapels that they are located under. In the 1980s, the crypt was also home to the Cathedral Works Company, which sold textiles.The crypt also formerly contained the Tiffany Chapel, created by jewelry designer Louis Comfort Tiffany. Originally exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, it was then acquired by Celia Whipple Wallace and moved to the cathedral in 1898. Services at the cathedral were hosted at the Tiffany Chapel from 1899 to 1911, and the chapel was reacquired by Tiffany in 1916. The chapel has been in the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida, since 1999.  Cathedral close  The cathedral close, surrounding the main cathedral, consists of several buildings on a 11.5 acre site, including the former Leake Watts asylum building, which predates the land's acquisition by the Episcopal Diocese of New York. The other structures were built later.The former asylum is located immediately south of the crossing. The Cathedral School of St. John the Divine is located on the eastern boundary of the site, just south of the apse. A Biblical garden is located between the school and the asylum building. To the southwest is a pulpit green, situated between the nave to the north and the Synod Hall and Diocesan House to the south. The Cathedral House is located south of the Biblical garden and east of the pulpit green. The Synod Hall and Diocesan House are located on the southern boundary. Various paths, gardens, play areas, and furniture are located on the cathedral close, as are numerous artworks and several commemorative or religious objects.The initial plans for the cathedral close, put forth in the 1890s, varied widely. The included a 1892 plan for buildings on Morningside Drive and Cathedral Parkway; various proposals for an Episcopal residence somewhere along the close; and an 1898 1899 plan for a deaconesses' training school. Two other plans were proposed in 1902 and 1903, but after objections to the 1903 plan from St. Luke's Hospital, a new plan was presented in 1906. The Training School for Deaconesses was completed in 1909, independently of the plan. Cram presented to the trustees an extensive plan for all the structures on the grounds in October 1911, and the trustees approved the choir school the same month. The following month, the trustees certified plans for the Synod Hall, bishop's house, and deanery, as well as the never built diocesan offices and canons' residences. A heating plant at the southwestern corner of the cathedral close , and two structures planned for the western boundary and approved in 1920, were not built.  Ithiel Town Building  The former Leake and Watts Asylum building, designed by Ithiel Town and completed in 1843, is located south of the crossing, where the south transept would have been located. The building, designed in the Greek Revival style, was originally composed of five parts. There was a central pavilion with Ionic style porticos to the south and north. The front entrance, located within the south portico, was approached by a wide granite staircase. The only decorative element was at the south portico's pediment, which was supported by six stucco covered brick columns, topped by capitals made of wood. Brick wings flanked the central pavilion to each side, and originally contained wooden porches along their facades, replaced with iron balconies in 1888. Originally, there were common areas and staff rooms within the central pavilion, and dormitories for 300 children in the wings. When the Episcopal Diocese of New York acquired the site, the former asylum building served several functions for the cathedral. Between 1892 and 1899, it was used as an employee dormitory and construction offices, while the parlor hosted worship services. Afterward, the former asylum's west wing was used by the day school for the cathedral's choirboys between 1901 and 1913. Cathedral leaders had proposed demolishing parts of the asylum building, since it was in the way of the proposed southern transept, though these demolitions did not happen. Subsequently, the west wing was used by the Diocese offices, and the east wing by Cathedral offices until 1949. The building then became the Exhibit Hall and the top stories were removed sometime afterward. The structure was renovated in 2004 2012, becoming the Ithiel Town Building .The Ithiel Town Building houses a textile laboratory that conserves the cathedral's textiles, including the Barberini tapestries to cartoons by Raphael. The laboratory also conserves tapestries, needlepoint, upholstery, costumes, and other textiles for its clients. The building has also housed the Museum of Religious Art, as well as offices, shops, choir rehearsal quarters, sacristies, and the Cathedral Community Cares program.  Diocesan House  The Diocesan House, also known as St. Faith's House, is the only building on the cathedral close to be designed by Heins LaFarge before they were fired. The structure, designed in the Tudor Gothic style, is located on the southern side of the cathedral close, close to Cathedral Parkway . It is a 3 1 2 story H shaped building with a brick facade, a base of Indiana limestone, and gable roofs above the pavilions on the western end. The southern elevation also contains an additional basement story. Its main entrance, on the eastern portion of the northern elevation, is a recessed arched portal with an oriel window on the third story. As of 2017, the Diocesan House is used by the diocese's offices and archives; the cathedral's library; and apartments.The Diocesan House was originally built for the New York Training School for Deaconesses, which was established in 1890 and had been searching for new locations since 1898 or 1899. Funds to build the structure were finally received in 1907 after Archdeacon Charles Comfort Tiffany included 125,000 for the deaconesses' school in his will. The building was originally supposed to be on the northern side of the cathedral close, but was moved due to objections from St. Luke's Hospital. Construction started in May 1910 and the school opened by that October. All work was finished in February 1911, and the building was used as a deaconesses' school until May 1948, and it was converted to office use the following year.  Synod Hall  The Synod Hall houses the cathedral's synod or council, but is also used for various events and other functions. It was completed in 1913 and was the first of four structures on the cathedral close to be designed by Cram, and was designed to be the most beautiful thing in New York . It is located at the southwestern corner of the cathedral close. The main entrance, an arched portal facing Amsterdam Avenue, contains carvings of Christian figures, which flank oak double doors. A carving of George Washington is located between the doors, and six smaller figures are located on the tympanum above the doors. The exterior is made of pink Kingwood sandstone. Inside is a hall that can seat over a thousand people, with gallery seating above the main level. There are grisaille windows to the north and south, and wooden trusses on the ceiling, supporting the gable roof. The Synod Hall also contains a three manual Skinner pipe organ.Plans for a diocesan building were considered as early as 1903. The current Synod Hall was announced in 1911, in preparation for the 1913 General Convention of the Episcopal Church. Cram's firm submitted plans for Synod Hall in March 1912, and it opened in October 1913 with the start of the convention. However, the hall was not completed until early 1914. After Bayard Cutting and J. P. Morgan made large donations toward the Synod Hall, the cathedral had to return some of the previous donations, as the two men had given more than enough funds to pay for the building.  School  The choir school building, now the Cathedral School of St. John the Divine, is located on the cathedral close's eastern border. The building is in the Collegiate Gothic style and is 4 1 2 stories tall. The exterior contains gray schist cladding and limestone trim, with architectural features such as a gabled roof, dormers protruding from the roof, and Tudor style arched openings. Inside, the building contained classrooms; gathering space for reception, dining; music rooms; a library; a gymnasium; a dormitory; and masters' and service rooms.The choir school was created in 1901 within the Town Building. A separate structure was first proposed in Walter Cook Winthrop A. Welch's 1906 plan for the campus. In January 1910, Mary Eliza Blodgett donated 25,000 toward the new school building's projected 150,000 cost, as a gift to honor her father John H. Sherwood. Blodgett later covered the rest of the choir school building's cost after no one else donated, while former choirboy Frederick G. Bourne provided a 500,000 endowment in 1914. Cram approved Cook Welch's plan in January 1912 and filed construction plans that July, with work beginning that October. The school building was finished in September 1913. The choir school consisted of day school for 20 adult men and a boarding school for 40 choirboys who paid no tuition. It was turned into a boys' day school in 1964 and a coeducational day school for grades K 8 in 1972.  Bishop's house and deanery  The Episcopal Residence, consisting of the bishop's house and deanery , were the final buildings that Cram designed within the cathedral close. The structures were intentionally built close together to evoke a feeling of coziness. According to Cram, the Chateauesque style buildings were inspired by later domestic buildings in the French Gothic style. The bishop's house is west of the deanery, on slightly higher ground; the deanery is thus hidden behind the bishop's house. A small garden is located at the northeast corner of the buildings.As built, the two structures contained a myriad of living space inside. The bishop's house contained eight rooms with seven bathrooms, while the deanery contained 20 rooms with five bathrooms. The deanery is three stories tall; like the choir school, it has gray schist cladding and limestone trim. It contains several pavilions with dormers and gabled roofs, as well as a loggia and an oriel window on the southern elevation. The bishop's house is four stories tall and is largely in the same design, but part of the northern elevation is made of exposed brick, marking the location where it would have connected to the unbuilt southern transept. The ornamentation of the bishop's house contains symbols of the diocesan offices, such as bishops; by contrast, the deanery has simpler decorations, such as depictions of flowers and cats. A private chapel between the two buildings was not built.An episcopal residence had been announced in 1897 and Heins LaFarge drew up plans for such a structure in 1902. The Deanery was donated by Helen Slade Ogilvie in 1911 in memory of her late husband Clinton, while the bishop's house was funded partly by the sale of a previous bishop's house at Gramercy Park. Initially, the site of the two structures was contested because the buildings would have blocked views of the main cathedral from the south. Before the structures' construction started in 1912, the sites for the bishop's house and deanery were relocated eastward. The two buildings' sites were given preliminary approval in May 1912 and were officially approved that October. The bishop's house started in November 1912 and was finished in April 1914. while the deanery was started in February 1913 and completed by that November. Both structures were erected by Leonard Jacob and Frederick T. Youngs. After the 1947 Diocesan Convention, the bishop moved into the upper two floors of the deanery, and the old bishop's house was turned into administration offices.  Residential buildings  In 2008, the cathedral leased the southeast corner of its property, which contained the cathedral's playground and Rose Garden, to the AvalonBay Communities, which built a luxury apartment building called the Avalon Morningside Park. The project includes 295 apartments, of which 20 are affordable housing units, as well as replacement rose garden. The cathedral leased the northeastern edge of its property, formerly a parking lot, in 2012. The lessee was the Brodsky Organization, which built a residential building called the Enclave between 2014 and 2015. The Enclave consists of 428 rental apartments in two 15 story buildings, separated by the passageway leading to the northern transept; an underground gallery connects the two buildings.Both developments leased the land from the cathedral for 99 year terms. The lease on the land under the Enclave pays the Cathedral about 3 million a year; the lease on the Avalon, about 2.5 million.  Art, activities, and exhibitions   Concerts and special events  The cathedral's interior is frequently used for concerts, performances, and other special events.  Recurring events  The cathedral has an annual New Year's Eve Concert for Peace. The Postlude to Act I of Leonard Bernstein's opera Quiet Place received its New York premiere at the 1985 concert. The 1990 concert was a tribute to Bernstein himself, who helped found the event and had died two months earlier on October 14.Paul Winter has given many concerts at the cathedral, and the Paul Winter Consort are the artists in residence. Among the major musical events that takes place every year is a celebration of the feast day of St. Francis, when the Paul Winter Consort participates in a liturgical performance of Winter's Missa Gaia . The musical group also performs at the annual Winter Solstice program.  One time events  The cathedral has also been used for several individual events: Duke Ellington's Second Sacred Concert, of his original sacred music compositions, premiered at the cathedral on January 19, 1968. When construction on the south tower restarted in 1982, French high wire artist Philippe Petit walked on a tightrope stretched across Amsterdam Avenue. Petit was also the artist in residence at St. John's starting in 1982. In 1990, the avant garde musician Diamanda Galas performed Plague Mass, a culmination of her work dedicated to the victims of the AIDS epidemic. Galas's performance consisted of covering her body in cattle blood and reinterpreting biblical texts and classic literature. She said it was a protest against what she saw as the ignorance and condemnation toward people with AIDS from religious and political groups. On December 8, 1994, Mariah Carey hosted a benefit concert for The Fresh Air Fund. The concert helped raise 700,000 to support the Fresh Air Fund and Carey's own Camp Mariah, and an additional 1 million from Carey herself. In November 2017, Aretha Franklin held her last large public concert, a 25th anniversary event for the Elton John AIDS Foundation being hosted at the cathedral.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine has also hosted events with spiritual leaders. Among them are Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, who first visited the cathedral in 1979. In addition, Bishop Desmond Tutu led a service in the cathedral in 1986.  Temporary art exhibitions  The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is also used as an art exhibition space: In 1977, a sculpture dedicated to the 12 firemen who died in the 23rd Street Fire of 1966 was unveiled at St. John's. Edwina Sandys's Christa, a sculpture exhibited during Holy Week in 1984, was based upon the feminine divine. Though the sculpture generally received positive acclaim, several pieces of hate mail were addressed to the cathedral, accusing the cathedral of blasphemy with its depiction of Christ on the cross. The statue was displayed again at The Christa Project: Manifesting Divine Bodies exhibition in 2016. The Value of Water, curated by artist activist Fredericka Foster, was exhibited at the cathedral in 2011. Featuring over forty artists, it was the largest ever art exhibition to appear at the cathedral. In 2014, the cathedral housed Phoenix, a sculptural group by Chinese artist Xu Bing. The two sculptures that comprised Phoenix was one of the largest pieces of sculpture ever displayed in the United States, weighing 12 short tons with lengths of 90 and 100 feet .  Poets' Corner  The Poets' Corner, inspired by a similar corner at Westminster Abbey, is located in the Arts Bay, on the nave's northern side. It was dedicated in 1985, with Emily Dickinson, Washington Irving, and Walt Whitman being the first poets to be inducted as part of the tradition. The Poets' Corner consists of a poet in residence, hired for a five year term, who in turn appoints electors on staggered terms. The poets in residence and electors have included 17 United States Poet Laureates. The electors then vote on choices for honorees, whose names are carved into blocks in the Poets' Corner; subsequent honorees have included Edgar Allan Poe, T. S. Eliot, William Faulkner, and William Carlos Williams. The electors' choices can be overturned, as occurred in 1999, when the Very Reverend Harry Pritchett vetoed Ezra Pound's inclusion because of Pound's anti Semitic statements during World War II.  Permanent works  The pulpit green contains the Peace Fountain, a large bronze work of public art by the cathedral's sculptor in residence, Greg Wyatt. It was commissioned in 1985 and depicts the struggle of good and evil; a battle between the Archangel Michael and Satan; and images of the Sun, the Moon, and several animals.  Advocacy Throughout the years, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine has been involved in various initiatives and projects. These programs included youth initiatives, a soup kitchen, a homeless shelter, and AIDS outreach. During the Vietnam War, the cathedral was also part of the opposition to United States involvement in the war. The Temple of Understanding, an interfaith organization, was housed at the cathedral for several decades in the late 20th century, moving to Midtown Manhattan in the 1990s.Several programs have been directed toward helping members of the surrounding community. In 1971, the cathedral founded ACT , a program that provided after school activities and summer camp to children in the neighborhood. The program still runs as of 2018 under the name Advancing the Community of Tomorrow . In 1974, in response to a need for housing in New York City, St. John's created a program that became the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board ; by 1987, the program had helped residential tenants in over 500 buildings to renovate and take ownership of their houses. Additionally, a homeless shelter, crisis center, clothes closet, and kitchen are run by in house volunteers.

These tours require paid tickets; there are discounts for seniors and students, as well as for those in tour groups. Admission is also included within several New York City tourist passes. The cathedral is open for tourism between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays, and between 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. on Sundays; it is open for worship between 7:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on all days of the week. Additionally, St. John's offers three types of daily tours , specific tours of different aspects of the cathedral, which cost more than the regular tickets.  Landmark status The Cathedral of St. John the Divine complex had been considered for designation as an official landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966. At the time, St. John's trustees had opposed the move because the structure was incomplete, and a landmark designation would have required the commission to review every proposed major expansion thereafter. The church's trustees were able to prevent designation by claiming the church was not completed, using a stipulation in the landmark's law that stated that potential landmarks had to have been completed for at least 30 years. A subsequent landmark designation was precluded in 1979 for a similar reason.In 2003, the exterior of the cathedral was again considered for landmark status; the interior was ineligible because the commission was legally unable to recognize religious buildings' interiors as landmarks. However, shortly after the commission conferred landmark status on the structure, the designation was unanimously overturned by the New York City Council, some of whose members favored landmark status for the entire cathedral close instead of just the main building. Councilman Bill Perkins proposed that the protective status should also be extended to the cathedral's grounds in order to control development there. The lack of an official city landmark designation meant that the cathedral site could potentially be redeveloped, and as such, two residential buildings were built on the same block as the cathedral. In 2017, the cathedral and six other buildings on the grounds were re designated a New York City Landmark; the designation excludes the two new structures.

            "text": "The Prestige is a 2006 science fantasy psychological thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan from a screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Christopher Priest. It follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in a competitive rivalry, with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden. It also stars Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, Rebecca Hall, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, and editor Lee Smith. The Prestige was released on October 20, 2006, to positive reviews and grossed 109 million worldwide against a production budget of 40 million. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography.  Plot In 1890s London, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden work as shills for a magician under the mentorship of John Cutter, an engineer who designs stage magic. During a water tank trick, Angier's wife Julia fails to escape and drowns. Angier, devastated, blames Borden for using a riskier knot, causing her death. When Angier asks Borden which knot he used, Borden claims not to know. The two become bitter enemies and rivals. Angier and Borden launch their own magic careers, with Angier working with Cutter, and Borden with the mysterious Fallon. Angier sabotages one of Borden's performances when he slips a real bullet into Borden's pistol during a bullet catch trick, resulting in Borden losing two of his fingers. Borden reciprocates by sabotaging Angier's disappearing bird act, killing the bird on stage and injuring a volunteer from the audience. Borden develops a trick he calls the Transported Man, in which he appears to travel instantly between two wardrobes on opposite ends of the stage. Unable to discern Borden's method, Angier hires a double, Gerald Root, to perform his own version of the trick. The imitation is a greater success, but Angier is dissatisfied, as he ends the trick hidden under the stage while Root basks in the applause. Root threatens to blackmail Angier and Cutter after being approached by Borden. Obsessed with figuring out Borden's trick, Angier has his assistant, Olivia, spy on Borden to learn how he performs the Transported Man. However, Olivia falls in love with Borden and becomes his assistant. With her help, Borden sabotages Angier's act, crippling his leg in the process. Confronted by Angier, Olivia gives him a copy of Borden's encoded diary. Angier acquires the keyword to decode it, TESLA , by threatening to kill Fallon. The diary takes Angier to America to meet scientist Nikola Tesla, who Angier believes built a teleportation machine for Borden. Tesla warns Angier about the dangers of obsession, but agrees to create the machine for him. Angier finishes reading the diary, where Borden reveals that he has no connection to Tesla, and that he faked his diary in order to send Angier on a wild goose chase. Tesla builds a machine for Angier, but instead of teleporting objects, Tesla's machine duplicates anything placed inside it a short distance away. Tesla is driven from Colorado Springs by agents of his rival, Thomas Edison, but has the machine delivered to Angier. He advises Angier to destroy it, saying it will bring him only misery. Borden's wife, Sarah, is driven to suicide by his contradictory personality, alternately loving and cold. Borden tells Olivia that he never loved Sarah, and that he loves her more. Tired of Borden and Angier's feud, Olivia leaves the relationship. In London, Angier debuts the Real Transported Man using Tesla's machine, appearing to have teleported across the theater. Borden sneaks backstage and witnesses Angier fall through a trapdoor and drown in a tank. He is discovered by Cutter and turned over to the police. Unable to prove his innocence, Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Tesla's machine is sold off to the wealthy Lord Caldlow, a purported magic enthusiast. Cutter visits Caldlow to advise him to destroy the machine and is shocked to discover that Caldlow is Angier, alive and well. Angier visits Borden in prison, accompanied by Borden's daughter Jess. Borden offers the secret to his Transported Man in exchange for his daughter's safety, but Angier rebuffs him, saying that his own trick is better. Cutter is disgusted that Angier allowed Borden to be sentenced to death, but agrees to help dispose of Tesla's machine. Borden is hanged for Angier's murder. Angier goes back to the theatre. A stranger enters and shoots Angier, revealing himself as Alfred Borden. Angier discovers Borden was an identity shared by a pair of identical twins. The brothers performed the original Transported Man together; when one was Borden , the other was disguised as Fallon . Alfred loved Sarah while his dead brother had loved Olivia. A dying Angier reveals that every performance a duplicate would fall into the tank and drown and that every time he used the machine he was unsure if he would end up dead or not. The theater catches fire and burns, while Borden reunites with his daughter, who has been rescued by Cutter.  Cast Hugh Jackman as Robert The Great Danton Angier Lord Caldlow, an aristocratic magician. Christopher Nolan hired Jackman, saying Angier had a wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience , a quality he believed Jackman had. Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man. Christian Bale as Alfred The Professor Borden Bernard Fallon, a working class magician. Although Nolan had previously cast Bale as Batman in Batman Begins, he did not consider Bale for the part of Borden until Bale contacted him about the script. Nolan said that Bale was exactly right for the part of Borden and that it was unthinkable for anyone else to play the part. Nolan suggested that the actors should not read the original novel, but Bale ignored his advice. Michael Caine as John Cutter, the stage engineer who works with Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan noted that the character was written before I'd ever met Caine. Caine describes Cutter as a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier . Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe, Angier and Borden's assistant. Nolan said that he was very keen for Johansson to play the role, and when he met with her to discuss it, she just loved the character . Piper Perabo as Julia McCullough, Milton the Magician's assistant and Angier's wife. Rebecca Hall as Sarah Borden, Borden's wife. Hall had to relocate from North London to Los Angeles in order to shoot the film, although the film itself takes place in London. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, the real life inventor who creates a teleportation device for Angier. For the role of Nikola Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was extraordinarily charismatic . Nolan said that David Bowie was really the only guy I had in mind to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role . Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him no one else could possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes. Andy Serkis as Mr. Alley, Tesla's assistant. Serkis said that he played his character with the belief that he was once a corporation man who got excited by this maverick, Tesla, so jumped ship and went with the maverick . Serkis described his character as a gatekeeper , a conman , and a mirror image of Michael Caine's character. Serkis, a big fan of Bowie, said that he was enjoyable to work with, describing him as very unassuming, very down to earth... very at ease with himself and funny. Ricky Jay as Milton the Magician, an older magician who employs Angier and Borden at the beginning of their careers. Jay and Michael Weber trained Jackman and Bale for their roles with brief instruction in various stage illusions. The magicians gave the actors limited information, allowing them to know enough to pull off a scene. Roger Rees as Owens, a solicitor working for Lord Caldlow. W. Morgan Sheppard as Merrit, the owner of a theater where Angier initially performs. Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden, the daughter of Sarah and Alfred. Daniel Davis as the judge presiding over Borden's trial. Russ Fega as Man in Hotel.  Production Julian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes's producer approached Christopher Priest for an adaptation of his novel The Prestige. Priest was impressed with Nolan's films Following and Memento, and subsequently, producer Valerie Dean brought the book to Nolan's attention. In October 2000, Nolan traveled to the United Kingdom to publicize Memento, as Newmarket Films was having difficulty finding a United States distributor. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother while walking around in Highgate . The development process for The Prestige began as a reversal of their earlier collaboration: Jonathan Nolan had pitched his initial story for Memento to his brother during a road trip.A year later, the option on the book became available and was purchased by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films. In late 2001, Nolan became busy with the post production of Insomnia, and asked his brother Jonathan to help work on the script. The writing process was a long collaboration between the Nolan brothers, occurring intermittently over a period of five years. In the script, the Nolans emphasized the magic of the story through the dramatic narrative, playing down the visual depiction of stage magic. The three act screenplay was deliberately structured around the three elements of the film's illusion: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. It took a long time to figure out how to achieve cinematic versions of the very literary devices that drive the intrigue of the story, Christopher Nolan told Variety: The shifting points of view, the idea of journals within journals and stories within stories. Finding the cinematic equivalents of those literary devices was very complex. Although the film is thematically faithful to the novel, two major changes were made to the plot structure during the adaptation process: the novel's spiritualism subplot was removed, and the modern day frame story was replaced with Borden's wait for the gallows. Priest approved of the adaptation, describing it as an extraordinary and brilliant script, a fascinating adaptation of my novel. In early 2003, Nolan planned to direct the film before the production of Batman Begins accelerated. Following the release of Batman Begins, Nolan started up the project again, negotiating with Jackman and Bale in October 2005. While the screenplay was still being written, production designer Nathan Crowley began the set design process in Nolan's garage, employing a visual script consisting of scale models, images, drawings, and notes. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan finished the final shooting draft on January 13, 2006, and began production three days later on January 16. Filming ended on April 9.Crowley and his crew searched Los Angeles for almost seventy locations that resembled fin de si cle London. Jonathan Nolan visited Colorado Springs to research Nikola Tesla and based the electric bulb scene on actual experiments conducted by Tesla. Nathan Crowley helped design the scene for Tesla's invention; It was shot in the parking lot of the Mount Wilson Observatory. Influenced by a Victorian modernist aesthetic, Crowley chose four locations in the Broadway theater district in downtown Los Angeles for the film's stage magic performances: the Los Angeles Theatre, the Palace Theatre, the Los Angeles Belasco, and the Tower Theatre. Crowley also turned a portion of the Universal back lot into Victorian London. Osgood Castle in Colorado was also used as a location.Nolan built only one set for the film, an under the stage section that houses the machinery that makes the larger illusions work, preferring to simply dress various Los Angeles locations and sound stages to stand in for Colorado and Victorian England. In contrast to most period pieces, Nolan kept up the quick pace of production by shooting with handheld cameras, and refrained from using artificial lighting in some scenes, relying instead on natural light on location. Costume designer Joan Bergin chose attractive, modern Victorian fashions for Scarlett Johansson; cinematographer Wally Pfister captured the mood with soft earth tones as white and black colors provided background contrasts, bringing actors' faces to the foreground. Editing, scoring, and mixing finished on September 22, 2006.  Themes The rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him Cutter's friendship, while providing him with a collection of his own dead clones; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through class warfare: Borden as The Professor, a working class magician who gets his hands dirty, versus Angier as The Great Danton, a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American. Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician as good or evil.Angier's theft of Borden's teleportation illusion in the film echoes many real world examples of stolen tricks among magicians. Outside the film, similar rivalries include magicians John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Kellar's dispute over a levitation illusion. Gary Westfahl of Locus Online also notes a new proclivity for mayhem in the film over the novel, citing the murder suicide disposition of Angier's duplicates and intensified violent acts of revenge and counter revenge. This relates to a more general alteration in the events and tone of the film rather than significantly changing the underlying themes.Nor is this theme of cutthroat competition limited to sleight of hand: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were directly engaged in the war of the currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical supremacy. In the novel, Tesla and Edison serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.Den Shewman of Creative Screenwriting says the film asks how far one would go to devote oneself to an art. The character of Chung Ling Soo, according to Shewman, is a metaphor for this theme. Film critic Alex Manugian refers to this theme as the meaning of commitment. Nicolas Rapold of Film Comment addresses the points raised by Shewman and Manugian in terms of the film's refracted take on Romanticism : Angier's technological solution which suggests art as sacrifice, a phoenix like death of the self and Borden's more meat and potatoes form of stagecraft embody the divide between the artist and the social being. For Manugian the central theme is obsession, but he also notes the supporting themes of the nature of deceit and science as magic. Manugian criticizes the Nolans for trying to ram too many themes into the story. The meta theme is the screenwriters Nolans as the magicians, creating a trick to fool movie audiences, with the audience doing their part as willing participants in suspending some disbelief to get there.  Release Touchstone Pictures opted to move the release date forward a week, from the original October 27, to October 20, 2006. The film earned 14.8 million on opening weekend in the United States, debuting at 1. It grossed 109 million, including 53 million from the United States. The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography , as well as a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007.  Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76 based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1 10. The website's critics consensus reads, Full of twists and turns, The Prestige is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale.Claudia Puig of USA Today described the film as one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade. Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying it demands repeat viewing, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing. Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a two thumbs up rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades. CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it among his best films of 2006. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.On the other hand, Dennis Harvey of Variety criticized the film as gimmicky, though he felt the cast did well in underwritten roles. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter felt that characters ...are little more than sketches. Remove their obsessions, and the two magicians have little personality. Nonetheless, the two reviewers praised David Bowie as Tesla, as well as the production values and cinematography. On a simpler note, Emanuel Levy has said: Whether viewers perceive The Prestige as intricately complex or just unnecessarily complicated would depend to a large degree on their willingness to suspend disbelief for two hours. He gave the film a B grade.Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing the revelation at the end as a fundamental flaw and a cheat. He wrote, The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two. R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, I love a good science fiction story; just tell me in advance. He gave the film a B . Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was 'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.' The film has grown in stature since its release. In 2009, The A.V. Club named The Prestige as one of the best films of the 2000s. The film was included in American Cinematographer's Best Shot Film of 1998 2008 list, ranking at 36. More than 17,000 people around the world participated in the final vote. In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it among The 100 Greatest Movies Of The 21st Century .  Music  The film score was written by English musician and composer David Julyan. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia. Following the film's narrative, the soundtrack had three sections: the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige.  Track listing  Some critics were disappointed with the score, acknowledging that while it worked within the context of the film, it was not enjoyable by itself. Jonathan Jarry of SoundtrackNet described the score as merely functional, establishing the atmosphere of dread but never taking over. Although the reviewer was interested with the score's notion, Jarry found the execution was extremely disappointing. Christopher Coleman of Tracksounds felt that though it was ...a perfectly fitting score, it was completely overwhelmed by the film, and totally unnoticed at times. Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks recommended the soundtrack for those who enjoyed Julyan's work on the film, and noted that it was not for those who expected any semblance of intellect or enchantment in the score to match the story of the film. Clemmensen called the score lifeless, constructed on a bed of simplistic string chords and dull electronic soundscapes. The song Analyse by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke is played over the credits.  Home media  The Region 1 disc is by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was released on February 20, 2007, and is available on DVD and Blu ray formats. The Warner Bros.

Special features are minimal, with the documentary Director's Notebook: The Prestige Five Making of Featurettes, running roughly twenty minutes combined, an art gallery and the trailer.

            "text": "Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin , also known as Michael Pupin, was a Serbian physicist, physical chemist and philanthropist based in the United States. Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long distance telephone communication by placing loading coils at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire . Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics on 3 March 1915, which later became NASA, and he participated in the founding of American Mathematical Society and American Physical Society. In 1924, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his autobiography. Pupin was elected president or vice president of the highest scientific and technical institutions, such as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Radio Institute of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an honorary consul of Serbia in the United States from 1912 to 1920 and played a role in determining the borders of newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  Early life and education  Mihajlo Pupin was an ethnic Serb, born on 4 October in the village of Idvor in the region of Banat, in the Military Frontier of the Austrian Empire, 1858. He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor : My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory. Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pan evo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship. Because of his activity in the Serbian Youth movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pan evo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen year old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States. When I landed at Castle Garden, forty eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.  Studies in America and Ph.D.  For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time. After Pupin completed his studies, with emphasis in the fields of physics and mathematics, he returned to Europe, initially the United Kingdom , where he continued his schooling supervised by John Tyndall at the University of Cambridge. He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis. He was an early investigator into X ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of R ntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on 2 January 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X rays generated secondary X rays. With his work in the field of X rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well known lawyer, was too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour which is the time it took to get an X ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if drawn with pen and ink. Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.  Pupin coils Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called Pupin coils , followed closely on the pioneering work of the English polymath Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone Telegraph , making him wealthy. Although AT T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.  Research during the First World War When the United States joined the First World War in 1917, Pupin was working at Columbia University, organizing a research group for submarine detection techniques. Together with his colleagues, professors Wils and Morcroft, he performed numerous researches with the aim of discovering submarines at Key West and New London. He also conducted research in the field of establishing telecommunications between places. During the war Pupin was a member of the state council for research and state advisory board for aeronautics. For his work he received a laudative from president Warren G. Harding, which was published on page 386 of his autobiography.  Contributions to determining borders of Yugoslavia  By World War I, Pupin was as well known for Serbian nationalism as science. He wrote that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in June 1914 was being prepared in Vienna during the last thirty six years , when Austro Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina began. Pan Serb ideology was, Pupin said, a natural heritage of every true Serb . As a politically influential figure in America, Pupin participated in the final decisions of the Paris peace conference after the war, when the borders of the future kingdom were drawn. Pupin stayed in Paris for two months during the peace talk on the insistence of the government. My home town is Idvor, but this fact says little because Idvor can't be found on the map. That is a small village which is found near the main road in Banat, which belonged to Austro Hungary, and now is an important part of Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians Kingdom. This province on the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, was requested by the Romanians, but their request was invalid. They could not negate the fact that the majority of the inhabitants were Serbs, especially in the Idvor area. President Wilson and Mr. Lancing knew me personally and when found out that I was originally from Banat, Romanian reasons lost its weight. According to the London agreement from 1915. it was planned that Italy should get Dalmatia. After the secret London agreement France, England and Russia asked from Serbia some territorial concessions to Romania and Bulgaria. Romania should have gotten Banat and Bulgaria should have gotten a part of Macedonia all the way to Skoplje.In a difficult situation during the negotiations on the borders of Yugoslavia, Pupin personally wrote a memorandum on 19 March 1919 to American president Woodrow Wilson, who, based on the data received from Pupin about the historical and ethnic characteristics of the border areas of Dalmatia, Slovenia, Istria, Banat, Me imurje, Baranja and Macedonia, stated that he did not recognize the London agreement signed between the allies and Italy.  Mihajlo Pupin foundation  In 1914, Pupin formed Fund Pijade Aleksi Pupin within the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts to commemorate his mother Olimpijada for all the support she gave him through life. Fund assets were used for helping schools in old Serbia and Macedonia, and scholarships were awarded every year on the Saint Sava day. One street in Ohrid was named after Mihajlo Pupin in 1930 to honour his efforts. He also established a separate Mihajlo Pupin fund which he funded from his own property in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which he later gave to Privrednik for schooling of young people and for prizes in exceptional achievements in agriculture , as well as for Idvor for giving prizes to pupils and to help the church district.Thanks to Pupin's donations, the library in Idvor got a reading room, schooling of young people for agriculture sciences was founded, as well as the electrification and waterplant in Idvor. Pupin established a foundation in the museum of Natural History and Arts in Belgrade. The funds of the foundation were used to purchase artistic works of Serbian artists for the museum and for the printing of certain publications. Pupin invested a million dollars in the funds of the foundation.In 1909, he established one of the oldest Serbian emigrant organizations in the United States called Union of Serbs Sloga. The organization had a mission to gather Serbs in immigration and offer help, as well as keeping ethnic and cultural values. This organization later merged with three other immigrant societies.Other emigrant organizations in to one large Serbian national foundation, and Pupin was one of its founders and a longtime president . He also organized Kolo srpskih sestara who gathered help for the Serbian Red Cross, and he also helped the gathering of volunteers to travel to Serbia during the First World War with the help of the Serbian patriotic organization called the Serbian National Defense Council which he founded and led. Later, at the start of the Second World War this organization was rehabilitated by Jovan Du i and worked with the same goal. Pupin guaranteed the delivery of food supplies to Serbia with his own resources, and he also was the head of the committee that provided help to the victims of war. He also founded the Serbian society for helping children which provided medicine, clothes and shelter for war orphans.  Literary work  Besides his patents he published several dozen scientific disputes, articles, reviews and a 396 page autobiography under the name Michael Pupin, From Immigrant to Inventor . He won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. It was published in Serbian in 1929 under the title From pastures to scientist . Beside this he also published: Pupin Michael: Der Osmotische Druck und Seine Beziehung zur Freien Energie, Inaugural Dissertation zur Erlangung der Doctorwurde, Buchdruckerei von Gustav Shade, Berlin, June 1889.

During Pupin's tenure, Harold C. Urey, in his work with the hydrogen isotope deuterium demonstrated the existence of heavy water, the first major scientific breakthrough in the newly founded laboratories . In 1934 Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the work he performed in Pupin Hall related to his discovery of heavy hydrogen .  Patents  Pupin released about 70 technical articles and reviews and 34 patents.  Honors and tributes   Private life After going to America, he changed his name to Michael Idvorsky Pupin, stressing his origin. His father was named Constantine and mother Olimpijada and Pupin had four brothers and five sisters. In 1888 he married American Sarah Catharine Jackson from New York, with whom he had a daughter named Barbara Ivanka Pupin who was born in 1899 in Yonkers, New York and died on August 2, 1962 in New York. They were married only for eight years, because she died from pneumonia. Pupin had a reputation not only as a great scientist but also a fine person. He was known for his manners, great knowledge, love of his homeland and availability to everyone. Pupin was a great philanthropist and patron of the arts. He was a devoted Orthodox Christian and a prominent Freemason.Mihajlo Pupin died in New York City in 1935 at age 76 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx.  Legacy He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

            "text": "John Pierpont Morgan Sr. was an American financier and investment banker who dominated corporate finance on Wall Street throughout the Gilded Age. As the head of the banking firm that ultimately became known as J.P. Morgan and Co., he was the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the United States spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over the course of his career on Wall Street, J.P. Morgan spearheaded the formation of several prominent multinational corporations including U.S. Steel, International Harvester and General Electric which subsequently fell under his supervision. He and his partners also held controlling interests in numerous other American businesses including Aetna, Western Union, Pullman Car Company and 21 railroads. Due to the extent of his dominance over U.S. finance, Morgan exercised enormous influence over the nation's policies and the market forces underlying its economy. During the Panic of 1907, he organized a coalition of financiers that saved the American monetary system from collapse. As the Progressive Era's leading financier, J.P. Morgan's dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform the shape of the American economy. Adrian Wooldridge characterized Morgan as America's greatest banker . Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan Jr. Biographer Ron Chernow estimated his fortune at 80 million .  Childhood and education Morgan was born and raised in Hartford, Connecticut, to Junius Spencer Morgan and Juliet Pierpont of the influential Morgan family. Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to his father's plans. In the fall of 1848, he transferred to the Hartford Public School, then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut , where he boarded with the principal. In September 1851, he passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, which specialized in mathematics for careers in commerce. In April 1852, an illness struck Morgan which became more common as his life progressed: Rheumatic fever left him in such pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to Boston to resume his studies. After graduation, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school in the Swiss village of La Tour de Peilz, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of G ttingen to improve his German. He attained passable fluency within six months, and a degree in art history; then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, his formal education complete.  Career   Early years and life  Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at 3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for 22 each. Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute 300 to take his place. From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed J.S. Morgan Co. upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864 to 1872, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, Anthony J. Drexel founded the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan Company with his apprentice Pierpont.  J.P. Morgan Company  After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened J. P. Morgan Company in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan Company of London. By 1900 it was one of the world's most powerful banking houses, focused primarily on reorganizations and consolidations.Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge. He often took over troubled business and reorganized their structures and management to return them to profitability, a process that became known as Morganization . His reputation as a banker and financier drew interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.  Railroads  In his ascent to power, Morgan focused on railroads, America's largest business enterprises. He wrested control of the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad from Jay Gould and Jim Fisk in 1869; led the syndicate that broke the government financing privileges of Jay Cooke; and developed and financed a railroad empire by reorganization and consolidation in all parts of the United States. He raised large sums in Europe; but rather than participating solely as a financier, he helped the railroads reorganize and achieve greater efficiency. He fought speculators interested only in profit and built a vision of an integrated transportation system. He successfully marketed a large part of William H. Vanderbilt's New York Central holdings in 1883. In 1885 he reorganized the New York, West Shore Buffalo Railroad, leasing it to the New York Central. In 1886 he reorganized the Philadelphia Reading, and in 1888 the Chesapeake Ohio. After Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, Morgan set up conferences in 1889 and 1890 that brought together railroad presidents to help the industry follow the new laws and write agreements for the maintenance of public, reasonable, uniform and stable rates . The first of their kind, the conferences created a community of interest among competing lines, paving the way for the great consolidations of the early 20th century. In addition, J P Morgan Co, and the banking houses which it succeeded, reorganized a large number of railroads between 1869 and 1899. Morgan also financed street railways, especially in New York City.A major political debacle came in 1904. The Northern Pacific Railway went bankrupt in the great depression of 1893. The bankruptcy wiped out the railroad's bondholders, leaving it free of debt, and a complex financial battle for its control ensued. In 1901, a compromise was reached between Morgan, New York financier E. H. Harriman and St. Paul, MN railroad builder James J. Hill. To reduce expensive competition in the Midwest, they created the Northern Securities Company to consolidate the operations of three of the region's most important railways: the Northern Pacific Railway, the Great Northern Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The consolidators ran into unexpected opposition, however, from President Theodore Roosevelt. An energetic trustbuster, Roosevelt considered the giant merger bad for consumers and a violation of the seldom enforced Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1902, Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue to break it up. In 1904 the Supreme Court dissolved the Northern Security company and the railroads had to go their separate, competitive ways. Morgan did not lose money on the project, but his all powerful political reputation suffered.  Treasury gold  The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he claimed the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30 year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re elected in 1900.  Steel  After his father's death in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan Co. . He began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900, with the goal of buying Carnegie's steel business and merging it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses , forming the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901, U.S. Steel was the world's first billion dollar company, with an authorized capitalization of 1.4 billion, much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads. U.S. Steel's goals were to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed the company's size would enable it to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets . U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as it sought to dominate not only steel but the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and many other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan captured two thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 market share. However, after 1901, its market share dropped; and in 1903, Schwab resigned to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer. Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, used aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro union troublemakers . The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger including Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary were more concerned with long range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a paternalistic labor policy.   Panic of 1907  The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis. Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked 35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks. Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over 6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel, owning valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel; he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid 30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.Vowing never to let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  Banking's critics  While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected. Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of 22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty two states west of the Mississippi River.  Unsuccessful ventures Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.  Nikola Tesla  In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans Atlantic wireless communication system that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla 150,000 to build the system in return for a 51 control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system. Morgan considered Tesla's changes a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, and never became operational.  London Underground  Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to build and operate a line on the London Underground. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with tube lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of .  International Mercantile Marine  In 1902, J.P. Morgan Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company , an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.  Morgan corporations From 1890 to 1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.  Manufacturing and construction industry   Railroads   Later years  Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York. He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of 125,000, and commanded Stanford White to ...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense... He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.  Personal life   Marriages and children  In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi . He married Frances Louisa Fanny Tracy , on May 31, 1865. They had four children: Louisa Pierpont Morgan , who married Herbert L. Satterlee J. P. Morgan Jr. , who married Jane Norton Grew Juliet Pierpont Morgan , who married William Pierson Hamilton Anne Tracy Morgan , philanthropist  Appearance  Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling as if a gale had blown through the house. He was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose. He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed without his permission; as a result of his self consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched. His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue. Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child he suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son in law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.His social and professional self confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.  Religion  Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders. He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan. In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their faith and order. Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed 100,000 to finance the commission's work.  Homes  His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882. It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878. It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned the Cragston estate, located in Highland Falls, New York. His son, of the same name, was the owner of East Island in Glen Cove, New York.J.P. Morgan spent three months of every year in London and owned two houses there. His 'town' house, 13 Prince's Gate was inherited from his father and was later expanded by the acquisition of the neighbouring Number 14 to house his growing art collection. After his death the merged houses were offered to the US government for use as the residence of the US Ambassador, from 1929 to 1955. His other property was Dover House, Putney, which was later demolished and developed into the Dover House Estate.  Yachting  An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts, the first being the Corsair, built by William Cramp Sons for Charles J. Osborn and launched on May 26, 1880. Charles J. Osborn was Jay Gould's private banker. Morgan bought the yacht in 1882. The well known quote, If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed. A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix les Bains, France. The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said: Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death.  Collector  Morgan was a collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. For a number of years the British artist and art critic Roger Fry worked for the museum, and in effect for Morgan, as a collector.His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.  Benefactor  Morgan was a benefactor of the Morgan Library and Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, Groton School, Harvard University , Trinity College, the Lying in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.  Gem collector  By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones . Tiffany Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where they were known as the Morgan Tiffany and the Morgan Bement collections. In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer morganite.  Photography  Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis 75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians. Curtis eventually published a 20 volume work entitled The North American Indian. Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters , which was restored in 1974 and re released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.  Other  Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.  Death  Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome, Italy. His body was brought back to America aboard the SS France, a French Line passenger ship. Flags on Wall Street flew at half staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City. His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont Jack Morgan Jr., inherited the banking business. He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library Museum in New York. His estate was worth 68.3 million , of which about 30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at 50 million.  Legacy His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass Steagall Act, the House of Morgan became three entities: J.P. Morgan Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house. The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  Popular culture A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy. Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist, in E. L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime, in Steven S. Drachman's novel The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh, in Graham Moore's novel The Last Days of Night, and in Marie Bendedict and Victoria Christopher Murray's novel, The Personal Librarian.Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher , guardian of the young Citizen Kane with whom he has a tense relationship Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood. According to Phil Orbanes, former vice president of Parker Brothers, the Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.The family of the illustrator Daniel Fox, who in 1936 created the mascot for the game, have accredited J. P. Morgan as being the inspiration for the character. Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America. My Name Is Morgan  1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Originally released as a coon song but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.

            "text": "The death ray or death beam was a theoretical particle beam or electromagnetic weapon first theorized around the 1920s and 1930s. Around that time, notable inventors such as Guglielmo Marconi, Nikola Tesla, Harry Grindell Matthews, Edwin R. Scott, Erich Graichen and others claimed to have invented it independently. In 1957, the National Inventors Council was still issuing lists of needed military inventions that included a death ray.While based in fiction, research into energy based weapons inspired by past speculation has contributed to real life weapons in use by modern militaries sometimes called a sort of death ray , such as the United States Navy and its Laser Weapon System deployed in mid 2014. Such armaments are technically known as directed energy weapons.  History In 1923, Edwin R. Scott, an inventor from San Francisco, claimed he was the first to develop a death ray that would destroy human life and bring down planes at a distance. He was born in Detroit, and he claimed he worked for nine years as a student and prot g of Charles P. Steinmetz. Harry Grindell Matthews tried to sell what he reported to be a death ray to the British Air Ministry in 1924. He was never able to show a functioning model or demonstrate it to the military.Nikola Tesla claimed to have invented a death beam which he called teleforce in the 1930s and continued the claims up until his death. Tesla explained that this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so called 'death rays'. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. Tesla proposed that a nation could destroy anything approaching within 200 miles... and will provide a wall of power in order to make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack . He claimed to have worked on the project since about 1900, and said that it drew power from the ionosphere, which he called an invisible ball of energy surrounding Earth . He said that he had done this with the help of a 50 foot tesla coil. Antonio Longoria in 1934 claimed to have a death ray that could kill pigeons from four miles away and could kill a mouse enclosed in a thick walled metal chamber .During World War II, the Germans had at least two projects, and the Japanese one, to create so called death rays. One German project led by Ernst Schiebold concerned a particle accelerator with a steerable bundle of beryllium rods running through the vertical axis. The other was developed by Dr. Rolf Wider e and is referred to in his biography. The machine developed by Wider e was in the Dresden Plasma Physics laboratory in February 1945 when the city was bombed. Wider e led a team in March 1945 to remove the device from the ruined laboratory and deliver it to General Patton's 3rd Army at Burggrub where it was taken into US custody on 14 April 1945. The Japanese weapon was called Death ray Ku Go which aimed to employ microwaves created in a large magnetron.  In science fiction The concept of a death ray has fueled science fiction stories at least as early as Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy's 1927 novel The Garin Death Ray. Later science fiction introduced the concept of the handheld raygun used by fictional characters such as Flash Gordon. In Alfred Noyes' 1940 novel The Last Man , a death ray developed by a German scientist named Mardok is unleashed in a global war and almost wipes out the human race. Similar weapons are found in spy fi films such as Murderers' Row and George Lucas's science fiction saga Star Wars.

            "text": "Maribor , German: ma ibo  ; also known by other historical names is the second largest city in Slovenia and the largest city of the traditional region of Lower Styria. It is also the seat of the City Municipality of Maribor, the seat of the Drava statistical region and the Eastern Slovenia region. Maribor is also the economic, administrative, educational, and cultural centre of eastern Slovenia. Maribor was first mentioned as a castle in 1164, as a settlement in 1209, and as a city in 1254. Like most Slovene ethnic territory, Maribor was under Habsburg rule until 1918, when Rudolf Maister and his men secured the city for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which then joined the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1991 Maribor became part of independent Slovenia. Maribor, along with the Portuguese city of Guimar es, was selected the European Capital of Culture for 2012.  Name Maribor was attested in historical sources as Marpurch circa 1145 , and is a compound of Middle High German march 'march ' burc 'fortress'. In modern times, the town's German name was Marburg an der Drau .The Slovene name Maribor is an artificial Slovenized creation, coined by Stanko Vraz in 1836. Vraz created the name in the spirit of Illyrianism by analogy with the name Brandenburg . Locally, the town was known in Slovene as Marprk or Marprog. The name Maribor was accepted among Slovenes only 25 years later, when Lovro Toman published a song named Mar i bor, giving the name a Slovene compound Mar 'to care' i 'and' bor 'to fight for'. In addition to its Slovene and German names, the city is also known as Marburgum in Latin and Marburgo in Italian.  History   Prehistory  The oldest known remnants of settlement in the Maribor area date back to the 5th millennium BC, at the time of the Chalcolithic. With the construction of Maribor's western bypass, larger settlements were discovered dating from the 44th to 42nd century BC. Another settlement from around the same period was also discovered in Spodnje Ho e, a town right next to Maribor and another below Melje Hill near Male nik. Another settlement below Melje Hill was also found dating to the 4th millennium BC.A more intense period of settlement of the Maribor area occurred in the 3rd millennium BC with the advent of the Bronze Age. In the 13th to 12th century BC, in the age of the Urnfield culture, new settlements were found in Pekel. Around 1000 BC, new settlers moved to the Maribor area. An urnfield cemetery was found from that period in today's Mladinska ulica and another necropolis was also found in Pobre je.  Antiquity  With the Iron Age and the Hallstatt Culture, new settlements began to appear on hills. One of them was Po tela in the Pohorje Mountains. Po tela was an old town that was abandoned in the 6th century BC and inhabited again in the 2nd century BC.During Roman times, the area where Maribor later developed was part of the province of Noricum, right on the border with Pannonia. During that period, Roman agricultural estates known as villae rusticae filled the area around Radvanje, Betnava, Bohova, and Ho e. The best known of them was in today's Borova Vas neighborhood of Maribor. An important trade route was also established in the area, connecting Celeia and Flavia Solva in one direction with Poetovio and central Noricum on the other.  Medieval history  After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Maribor area was settled by the Slavs. A Slavic cemetery was found in Radvanje dating to the 10th century AD. The area of what later became Maribor was first part of Samo's Empire and later the area stood on the border between Carantania and Lower Pannonia. In 843 the area was absorbed into the Frankish Empire.In the Frankish Empire, the area again stood on the border, this time between the Frankish Empire and the Principality of Hungary. To protect the Frankish Empire from Hungarian raids, a castle was built on Pyramid Hill. The castle was mentioned for the first time on 20 October 1164 as Castrum Marchburch. A settlement soon began to grow below the castle. Maribor was first mentioned as a market near the castle in 1204, and it received town privileges in 1254. It is likely that the castle stood before 1164 because Bernard of Trixien, the count of the region, already used the title Bernhard von Marchpurg 'Bernard of Maribor' in 1124. The town began to grow rapidly after the victory of Rudolf I of the Habsburg dynasty over King Otakar II of Bohemia in 1278. The town built fortifications, and trade, viticulture, and crafts started to grow. The town had a monopoly over the entire region and also controlled the viticulture trade with Carinthia. The first churches were built, and also around this time the first Jews arrived. The Jews built their own ghetto in the southeastern part of town, where they also built the Maribor Synagogue. Most Slovenians lived in the northwestern part of town on what is now Slovenian Street . During the Middle Ages the castle belonged to the important Lordship Marburg with the old castle Obermarburg. In 1478, a second castle was built on the northeastern side of the town, today known as Maribor Castle. In 1480 and in 1481, Matthias Corvinus besieged the town but failed to conquer it on both occasions. In 1496, Maximilian I issued a decree to expel all Jews from Maribor and Styria. In 1515, the Maribor Town Hall was built and a few years later, in 1532, Maribor again came under siege, this time by the Ottoman Empire. In the battle that became known as the Siege of Maribor, a 100,000 strong Ottoman army under the leadership of Suleiman the Magnificent attacked the town, which was defended only by the local garrison and its citizens. Despite all the odds, Maribor was defended and the legend of the Maribor shoemaker who raised the sluice gates and flooded the Ottoman army is still popular today.  Modern period  In the 17th century, numerous fires razed the town. The biggest ones occurred in 1601, 1645, 1648, and 1700. As a consequence the town was rebuilt numerous times. In addition to fires, the plague decimated the town's population. The largest plague epidemics occurred in 1646, 1664, and 1680. Due to the plague, the town lost 35 percent of its population. In gratitude for the end of the plague, a plague column was built in 1681, with the original being replaced in 1743. In 1846, the Southern Railway was built through the town, which resulted in great economic growth and territorial expansion. In 1859, Anton Martin Slom ek, a bishop of the Diocese of Lavant, transferred the seat of the diocese to Maribor, and he further encouraged the use of Slovene. With the transfer, Maribor also received its first higher school. Four years later, Maribor was connected with Carinthia with the construction of the railway from Maribor to Prevalje. The first daily Slovenian newspaper, called Slovenski narod, was established in 1868 on today's Slom ek Square . On 4 April 1883, the first electric light in Slovene ethnic territory was installed on Castle Square . The renowned electrical engineer Nikola Tesla lived in Maribor from 1878 to 1879, where he received his first job. Maribor National Hall was built in 1899, and it became a political, cultural, and economic centre for all Styrian Slovenes. In 1900, the city itself had a population that was 82.3 Austrian German and 17.3 Slovene ;: 4 most of the city's capital and public life was in Austrian German hands. However, the county excluding the city had only 10,199 Austrian Germans and 78,888 Slovene inhabitants, meaning the city was completely surrounded by majority Slovene ethnic territory.: 210, 300 Some former independent settlements that later became part of the city had more ethnic Slovenes than Austrian Germans , whereas others had more Austrian Germans than ethnic Slovenes .: 202 206 In 1913, a new bridge was opened over the Drava River, today known as the Old Bridge. In World War I, the 47th Infantry Regiment of the Austro Hungarian Army was based in the city and also fought on the Isonzo front. During the First World War many Slovenes in Carinthia and Styria were detained on suspicion of being enemies of the Austrian Empire. This led to distrust between Austrian Germans and Slovenes. After the collapse of the Austrian Hungarian Empire in 1918, Maribor was claimed by both the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and German Austria. On 1 November 1918, a meeting was held by Colonel Anton Holik in the Melje barracks, where it was decided that the city would be part of German Austria. Ethnic Slovene Major Rudolf Maister, who was present at the meeting, denounced the decision and organised Slovenian military units that were able to seize control of the city. All Austrian officers and soldiers were disarmed and demobilised to the new state of German Austria. The German city council then held a secret meeting, where it was decided to do whatever possible to regain Maribor for German Austria. They organised a military unit called the Green Guard , and approximately 400 well armed soldiers of this unit opposed the pro Slovenian and pro Yugoslav Major Maister. Slovenian troops surprised and disarmed the Green Guard early on the morning of 23 November. Thereafter, the city remained in Slovenian hands. On 27 January 1919, Austrian Germans gathered to await the United States peace delegation at the city's marketplace were fired upon by Slovenian troops. Nine citizens were killed and some eighteen were seriously wounded;: 142 who had actually ordered the shooting has never been unequivocally established. German sources accused Maister's troops of shooting without cause. In turn Slovene witnesses such as Maks Pohar claimed that the Austrian Germans attacked the Slovenian soldiers guarding the town hall, one even discharging a revolver and hitting one Slovenian soldier in the bayonet.: 141 The German language media called the incident Marburg's Bloody Sunday. As Maribor was now firmly in the hands of the Slovenian forces and surrounded completely by Slovenian territory; the city had been recognised as part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes without a plebiscite in the Treaty of Saint Germain of 10 September 1919 between the victors and German Austria. For his actions in Maribor and later in the Austro Slovene conflict in Carinthia, Rudolf Maister is today considered a Slovenian national hero.After 1918, most of Maribor's Austrian Germans left the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for Austria. A policy of cultural assimilation was pursued in Yugoslavia against the Austrian German minority similar to the Germanization policy followed by Austria against its Slovene minority in Carinthia. From 1922 to 1929, Maribor was the seat of the Maribor Oblast, a subdivision within Yugoslavia and was later part of the Drava Banovina. Up until World War II, Maribor was considered the fastest developing city in the country.  World War II and aftermath  In 1941 Lower Styria, the predominantly Slovene part of Styria, was annexed by Nazi Germany. German troops marched into the town at 9 pm on 8 April 1941. On 26 April Adolf Hitler, who encouraged his followers to make this land German again , visited Maribor and a grand reception was organised in the city castle by the local Germans. Immediately after the occupation, Nazi Germany began mass expulsions of Slovenes to the Independent State of Croatia, Serbia, and later to the concentration and work camps in Germany. The Nazi goal was to Germanize the population of Lower Styria after the war. Slovene patriots were taken hostage and many were later shot in the prisons of Maribor and Graz. This led to organised resistance by Slovene partisans. The first act of resistance in Maribor and occupied Slovenia occurred only three days after Hitler's visit, when Slovene communists and SKOJ members burned two German cars.Maribor was the site of a German prisoner of war camp from 1941 to 1945 for many British, Australian, and New Zealand troops who had been captured in Crete in 1941. In 1944, the largest mass rescue of POWs of the war in Europe took place when 105 Allied prisoners from the camp were freed by Slovene partisans in the Raid at O balt. The city, a major industrial centre with an extensive armament industry, was systematically bombed by the Allies in the closing years of World War II. A total of 29 bombing raids devastated some 47 of the city area, killing 483 civilians and leaving over 4,200 people homeless. Over 2,600 people died in Maribor during the war. By the end of the war, Maribor was the most war damaged major town of Yugoslavia. The remaining German speaking population, except those who had actively supported the resistance during the war, was summarily expelled at the end of the war in May 1945. At the same time Croatian Home Guard members and their relatives who tried to escape from Yugoslavia were executed by the Yugoslav Army. The existence of nine mass graves in and near Maribor was revealed after Slovenia's independence.  Contemporary history  After the Second World War, Maribor became part of SR Slovenia, within SFR Yugoslavia. A major process of renewal and reconstruction began in the city. Maribor soon after became the industrial centre of Slovenia and the whole of Yugoslavia, hosting many known companies such as the Maribor Automobile Factory among others. The first clash between the Yugoslav People's Army and the Slovenian Territorial Defence in Slovenia's war of independence happened in nearby Pekre and on the streets of Maribor resulting in the conflicts first casualty. After Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991, the loss of the Yugoslav market severely strained the city's economy, which was based on heavy industry. The city saw a record unemployment rate of nearly 25 .The economic situation of Maribor after the mid 1990s crisis worsened again with the onset of global economic crisis combined with the European sovereign debt crisis, which was one of the causes for the beginning of 2012 13 Maribor protests which spread into 2012 2013 Slovenian protests. During the year 2012 Maribor was also one of two European Capitals of Culture and the following year Maribor was the European Youth Capital.  Geography   Topography  On the Drava River lies Maribor Island . The oldest public bath, still important and often visited place in Maribor, is located on the island. There are two hills in Maribor: Calvary Hill and Pyramid Hill, both surrounded by vineyards. The latter dominates the northern border of the city. Ruins of the first Maribor castle from the 11th century and a chapel from the 19th century also stand there. The hill offers an easily accessible scenic overlook of Maribor and the countryside to the south over the Drava River.  City districts   Climate  Maribor has a humid continental climate , bordering on oceanic climate . Average temperatures hover around zero degrees Celsius during the winter. Summers are generally warm. Average temperatures during the city's warmest month exceed 20 degrees Celsius, which is one of the main reasons for the Maribor wine tradition. The city sees on average roughly 900 mm of precipitation annually and it's one of the sunniest Slovene cities, with an average of 266 sunny days throughout the course of the year. The most recent temperature heatwave record for August is 40.6 C, measured at the Maribor Tabor weather station by the Slovenian Environment Agency on 8 August 2013.  Architecture  Many historical structures stand in Maribor. Of the remains of city walls surrounding the old downtown, the most prominent are the Judgement Tower, the Water Tower, and the Jewish Tower. Maribor Cathedral was built in the Gothic style in the 13th century. Maribor Synagogue was built in the 14th century, and is the second oldest synagogue of Europe. Today it serves as a centre for cultural activities. Other prominent Medieval buildings are Maribor Castle, Betnava Castle, and the ruins of Upper Maribor Castle on Pyramid Hill. Town Hall was constructed in the Renaissance style, and the Plague Column in the Baroque style. At the start of the 21st century, plans were made for a new modern business, residential and entertainment district, called the Drava Gate and nicknamed the Maribor Manhattan. The project includes many new exclusive residential apartments, offices and conference halls, a green and recreational space, and other structures. It also includes a 111 m tall skyscraper that would be the tallest building in Slovenia. Due to lack of finances, the project has been postponed. In 2008, the Studenci Footbridge was renovated according to the design of the Ponting company. The design was awarded that year at the 3rd International Footbridge Conference in Porto.In 2010, Maribor organised an international architectural competition ECC Maribor 2012 Drava 2012 to gather proposals for the design and reconstruction of the Drava banks, the construction of a new art gallery, and for a new footbridge. Its jury received about 400 proposals for the three different projects. The footbridge and the river embankments will be built in the near future, but the art gallery was replaced with a cultural center MAKS, which is currently under construction. The construction of a new modern Faculty of Medicine started in 2011 near the Drava River. It was designed by architect Boris Podrecca and was completed in 2013. There are plans to renovate the Maribor Public Library and Town Hall Square . In addition, the renovation of Maribor Island in the Drava River has been planned.     Parks and other green spaces  The main park of the city is Maribor City Park, with the City Aquarium and Terrarium, and a wide promenade leading to the Three Ponds , containing over 100 local and foreign species of deciduous and coniferous trees.  Demographics and religion   Catholic Church  Maribor, previously in the Catholic Diocese of Graz Seckau, became part of the Diocese of Lavant on 1 June 1859, and the seat of its Prince Bishop. The name of the diocese was later changed to the Diocese of Maribor on 5 March 1962. It was elevated to an archdiocese by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 April 2006.  Jewish community  Jewish people living in Maribor were first mentioned in 1277. It is suggested that at that time there was already a Jewish quarter in the city. The Jewish ghetto was located in the southeastern part of the city and it comprised, at its peak, several main streets in the city centre including part of the main city square. The ghetto had a synagogue, a Jewish cemetery and also a Talmud school. The Jewish community of Maribor was numerically at its apex around 1410. After 1450 the circumstances changed dramatically: increasing competition that coincided with an economic crisis dealt a severe blow to the economic activities that were crucial to their economic success. According to a decree issued by Emperor Maximilian I in 1496, Jews were forced to leave the city of Maribor. Restrictions on settlement and business for Jews remained in place until 1861. From late spring 1941, after Lower Styria was annexed by the Third Reich, the Jews of Maribor were deported to concentration camps.  Culture  The city is the location of the University of Maribor, established in 1975, Alma Mater Europaea, and several other higher education institutions. High schools include Maribor High School No. 1 and Maribor High School No. 2 .Every June, the two week Lent Festival is held, with hundreds of musical, theatrical and other events. Every year the festival attracts theatre, opera, ballet performers, classical, modern, and jazz musicians and dancers from all over the world. Maribor is known for wine and culinary specialities of international and Slovene cuisine . There are also many popular restaurants with Serbian cuisine. The Vinag Wine Cellar , with the area of 20.000 m2 and the length of 2 km , keeps 5,5 millions litres of wine. The house of the oldest grapevine in the world at Lent grows the world's oldest grapevine, which was in 2004 recorded in Guinness World Records. The grapevine of ametovka is over 400 years old.The most listened radio station transmitting from Maribor is the commercial radio station Radio City. Other radio stations broadcasting from Maribor include Radio NET FM, Radio Maribor, Rock Maribor, Radio Brezje, and Maribor tudent Radio . The alternative scene of Maribor is situated in the Pekarna Cultural Centre, located in a former military bakery area in the Magdalena District.  Sports   Team sports  Maribor is the hometown of the association football club NK Maribor, playing in the Slovenian top division. NK Maribor has won the domestic title a record 16 times and has participated in the UEFA Champions League group stage on three occasions, in 1999, 2014, and 2017. The club's home ground is Ljudski vrt, located in the Koro ka Vrata district. Maribor's handball club is RK Maribor Branik. The team competes in the Slovenian First League of Handball and plays home games at Tabor Hall.  Winter sports  Since 1964, the Maribor Pohorje Ski Resort, situated on the outskirts of the city on the slopes of the Pohorje mountain range, hosts the women's slalom and giant slalom races for the Alpine Skiing World Cup. The competition is known as the Golden Fox .  Event hosting  In November 2012, Maribor hosted the World Youth Chess Championship with Garry Kasparov as the guest of honour. It was presumed that Maribor would also host the 2013 Winter Universiade, but the Government of Slovenia refused any financial support for the project. As a result, in March 2012, the International University Sports Federation decided that it would organise the Universiade elsewhere. In the same year, Maribor also withdrew as one of the host cities of the EuroBasket 2013 due to lack of finances.Maribor's Ljudski vrt stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 UEFA European Under 17 Championship and the 2021 UEFA European Under 21 Championship.

            "text": "The Century Magazine was an illustrated monthly magazine first published in the United States in 1881 by The Century Company of New York City, which had been bought in that year by Roswell Smith and renamed by him after the Century Association. It was the successor of Scribner's Monthly Magazine. It was merged into The Forum in 1930.  History The initial editor was to have been Scribner's editor and co owner Josiah G. Holland, but he died prior to the appearance of the first issue. He was succeeded by Richard Watson Gilder, the managing editor of Scribner's, who would go on to helm The Century for 28 years. Gilder largely continued the mixture of literature, history, current events, and high quality illustrations that Holland had used at Scribner's. The magazine was very successful during the 19th century, most notably for a series of articles about the American Civil War which ran for three years during the 1880s. It included reminiscences of 230 participants from all ranks of the service on both sides of the conflict. According to an author writing in The New York Times, the publication of The Century made New York, instead of London, the centre of the illustrated periodicals published in the English language The magazine was also a notable publisher of fiction, presenting excerpts of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884 and 1885 and Henry James' The Bostonians.Upon Gilder s death in 1909, Robert Underwood Johnson replaced him as editor. According to Arthur John, the magazine s later history was marked by sudden shifts in content, format, and editorial direction. Glenn Frank was editor from 1921 to 1925, a period during which The Century was known for its editorials on current events and began to cut back on illustrations, which were completely eliminated after Frank left the magazine. In 1929, due to competition from cheaper magazines and newspapers, The Century became a quarterly, and in 1930 it was merged with The Forum. At the time it folded, The Century had 20,000 subscribers, less than a tenth of its peak circulation of the late nineteenth century. Scribner s Monthly Magazine, the periodical that became The Century in 1881, should not be confused with the Scribner s Magazine that began publication in 1887.The noted critic and editor Frank Crowninshield briefly served as the magazine's art editor.  Philosophy and political positions The tone and content of The Century changed over its long history. It began as an Evangelical Christian publication, but over time began to speak to a more general educated audience as it developed into the largest periodical in the country.  Religion  Novelist and poet Josiah G. Holland was one of the three original founders of Scribner s Monthly and wrote regular editorials for the periodical, setting the tone for the magazine's content. As Holland was deeply religious, Scribner's to a great extent reflected the views and concerns of the Evangelical Christian community. While hostile towards sectarianism within Protestantism, Scribner's initially took a strong stand against both Catholicism and those who doubted the divinity of Christ. In the first issue, under the heading Papa and the Dogma, Holland claimed that it was freedom that made the Protestant nations of Europe strong while their Catholic neighbors were, as a result of their religion, in a state of decay. Less than one year later, the magazine attacked the skepticism of Henry David Thoreau. Mormon polygamy was also a frequent target. One contributor traveled to Utah to observe the Mormon settlement there and argued that the new sect would have to end its practice of plural marriage if it were to survive and American control could be exercised over the western territories.At the same time, Scribner s Monthly, being non dogmatic in its Protestantism, expressed little hostility towards modern science. For example, a three part series discussed how believing Christians should meet the intellectual challenges of religious skepticism, and in 1874 two writers engaged one another in a debate over whether Christians should attempt to prove the divinity of Christ through science.By the end of the 1870s, however, Scribner s had departed from its original Evangelical orientation. An April 1879 editorial declared all seekers of truth, whether believing Christians or not, to be allies, regarding this new view as simply an application of the Golden Rule. Catholics were said to have just as much to teach Protestants as Protestants had to teach Catholics. After the magazine became The Century in 1881, it continued to hold onto this secular outlook under Gilder. The break with the past was reflected in the magazine s changing treatment of the question of evolution. In 1875, Scribner s argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Darwinism was true and attributed its wide acceptance to a contemporary bias towards novel ideas, even though the author did not on principle reject the idea that proof could be forthcoming. Upon the death of Charles Darwin in 1883, however, The Century published a laudatory tribute to the scientist written by Alfred Wallace. The magazine remained secular into its later days, in 1923 criticizing the poisonous dogmatism of the thought of William Jennings Bryan and what the magazine saw as his religious fundamentalism. Over the years, The Century published works by a large number of writers who were agnostics or atheists, including famous skeptic Bertrand Russell.  American nationalism  From the very beginning of his tenure as editor in 1881 to his death in 1909, The Century reflected the ideals of Gilder. He sought to create and help shape a refined American high culture, often contributing his own poetry to that end. Everything from its historical memoirs to political commentary reflected the influence of nineteenth century romanticism. An unsigned May 1885 editorial expressed pride over the belief of the staff that the periodical had achieved wide circulation while remaining a quality product. This reflected the view that as a general matter there was usually a tradeoff between quality and quantity. The Century was generally seen as a conservative magazine and hoped to promote reconciliation between the North and South after the trauma of the Civil War. According to J. Arthur Bond, the magazine was instrumental in creating and shaping post war American nationalism. In the words of one contemporary, Gilder s spirited and tireless endeavor  was to give the organic life of the American people purity of character and nobility of expression. During his tenure as editor, he promoted patriotism and the glorification of American historical figures. Seeing itself as having an elevating mission, its mixture of nationalism and cultural advocacy informed even the most ordinary of the magazine's articles. Often touching on many of these themes, Theodore Roosevelt wrote as a regular contributor to the magazine over three decades, a span which included one article he published while serving as President. Gilder developed relationships with several contemporary prominent figures, including a close friendship with Grover Cleveland which he wrote about upon the death of the former president. It has been argued that the decline in the popularity of the magazine from the 1890s on was connected to the general triumph of more egalitarian ideologies and the collapse of nineteenth century romanticism and idealism. Concerns over national unity and the preservation of traditional American culture were reflected in the magazine s writings on immigration. An 1884 article discussed the composition and geographical distribution of immigrant populations, and expressed optimism over the prospect of the newer Americans assimilating into the larger population. At the same time, the article warned that measures should be taken against potential threats to national unity through fractionalization. As immigration increased over the next few decades, however, The Century became more alarmed over its effects on the future of the country, citing concerns over, among other matters, crime, illiteracy, and the overpopulation of cities. In 1904, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge took to the pages of the magazine to argue for the importance of keeping out undesirable immigrants. Twenty years later, editor Glenn Frank attacked the Ku Klux Klan and other nativists, but nonetheless wrote that t he hour for very severe restrictions on immigration has come The same author returned to some of the same themes when he again attacked the KKK several months later for both its religious and racial doctrines.  Reconstruction and civil rights  In the immediate post Reconstruction era, contributors to The Century debated what should be done about the postwar South and the newly free slaves, generally advocating for amicable relations between the regions and national unity. In 1873 and 1874, Scribner s ran a number of articles under the title The Great South, a series which lasted fourteen issues. Based on Edward King s travels, the author s accounts generally portrayed the region in a sympathetic light and the series was warmly received by Southerners. In 1876, Scribner s published a eulogy to Robert E. Lee, along with an editorial postscript praising the spirit of sectional friendliness of the piece.On the question of the freedmen, a wide variety of contemporary views were represented. Writing for Scribner s in 1874, one author argued that blacks were unfit to be schooled with white children. On the other hand, an 1885 article by George W. Cable despaired over what he saw as the failure to protect the rights of southern blacks after the Civil War and argued that this was the result of the former confederate states evading federal law. Henry W. Grady, responding a few months later, disputed the earlier author s characterization of the situation, claiming that while legal rights had been granted, southern whites would never accept social integration between the races. Cable s criticisms of the ex Confederacy also drew a rebuke by Robert Lewis Dabney.Even when sympathetic to the cause of the newly freed slaves, writers who argued for helping them usually did so on paternalistic grounds. Bishop T. U. Dudley, for example, expressed doubt that much could be done to elevate the status of American blacks, but argued that Christian principles required helping them to the greatest extent possible.The question of how much government policy could do to improve the circumstances of the former slaves continued to be debated over the decades. By the turn of the century, the debates were conducted in the language of science. Robert Bennett Bean, a medical doctor, published a 1906 article arguing that social policy should be based on realistic assessments of the relative mental capacities of blacks and whites. He claimed that blacks had, on average, smaller brains than Asians or Caucasians, a finding he attributed to heredity. Similarly, Charles Francis Adams spent two years in Egypt and the Sudan and referenced his experiences to argue in 1906 that the unfortunate circumstances of American blacks were mainly due to inherently low capabilities rather than history. In the same issue, however, the editors felt it necessary to mention the dissenting view of Franz Boas, who had painted a more optimistic picture of the potential of Africans in a different periodical two years earlier.Booker T. Washington contributed four articles to the magazine in the first decade of the twentieth century, including one on Heroes in Black Skins. and another that discussed efforts of blacks to become homeowners. A 1903 editorial sang the praises of Washington, calling him the Moses of his people and contrasting him favorably with W.E.B. Du Bois.Reflecting the magazine s later shift leftward, Du Bois himself contributed an article to The Century in 1923. Several editorials around that time criticized the revived Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s. Frank Tannenbaum, for example, wrote that the Klan of the Reconstruction era was a reflex of the vindictiveness of Northern politicians and of the unscrupulous carpet baggers who swooped down upon the South as a vulture upon a wounded and stricken victim. But the contemporary Klan, according to Tannenbaum, had no such justification and simply reflected fears of change and other pathologies of segments of the white population.  Progressive causes  The magazine championed several Progressive causes popular in its time. Among these were several civil service reforms including competitive examinations for public offices, which its writers saw as a way to promote good governance and reduce class privilege. Similarly, in 1894 Henry Cabot Lodge attacked the un American practice of patronage. The Century also took up some of the environmental causes of its day, expressing satisfaction over the first attempts by the federal government to preserve the nation's forests, and in its later days supported women's suffrage. Finally, the magazine occasionally published articles in favor of eugenics. Frank, for example, while disparaging the racism of the KKK, encouraged what he called the better individuals of every race to use the tools of modern science to focus on improving the genetic quality of all populations.  Socialism and the labor movement  Scribner s generally defended the principles of classical economics and opposed socialism. William Graham Sumner wrote an article for the magazine in this vein praising traditional capitalist virtues such as self reliance and individualism and attributing poverty to laziness and vice. On the other hand, Holland occasionally directed his ire towards soulless corporations that he accused of exploiting workers. In the view of the magazine, both capitalists and workers had moral obligations. In its early days, The Century tended to adopt the same views as its predecessor. It defended capitalism, but refrained from unreflectively denouncing all forms of regulation. For example, an 1886 article opposed socialism but argued that in the future there would be more need for government activism than there had been in the past. Over the next few decades, The Century published several forceful denunciations of socialist theories and practice. In the 1890s Gilder and his editors took the position that labor unions were a foreign imposition, one of the many negative consequences of a relatively open immigration policy. Similarly, socialism was said to punish success, a concept that was anathema to the philosophy of his magazine. Despite its conservative leanings, the magazine was open to dissenting views on economic issues in a way that it was not on deeper philosophical matters. The March 1904 issue allowed workers to publish contributions making the case for labor unions as appropriate checks on big business. Two years later, an editorial praised some of the accomplishments of the labor movement, while still maintaining that it needed to be reformed.In its later years, after the Russian Revolution had brought the issue to the attention of the public, The Century opposed the spread of Communism. Employing Nietzschean terminology, Lothrop Stoddard in 1919 called Bolshevism the heresy of the Underman, in contrast to Prussianism, the heresy of the Overman, which had been defeated in the First World War. He went on to argue that the Bolshevik Revolution had only been the local manifestation of a phenomenon that would have to be defeated worldwide and that Vladimir Lenin was a modern Jenghiz Khan plotting the plunder of a world.  Turn of the 20th century decline  While remaining extremely influential and well regarded among the American elite, the popularity of The Century began to decline in the 1890s and never regained the prominence it had enjoyed as the leading American periodical of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, it had about 125,000 subscribers, half of the circulation it had in the 1880s. The Century suffered due to competition from other cheaper magazines, many of which Gilder and his staff considered vulgar.Although Gilder had been a zealous reformer, as a conservative in politics and values he never embraced the Progressive movement. As its circulation declined, the magazine took a more pessimistic tone and began to write less and less about current events. An 1898 editorial criticized the profusion in the literary and pictorial output which has a tendency to befog the intellect and lower the standards of taste. A few months later the magazine lamented that the age of reflection had given way to the age of agitation spread by f ast trains and cheap print Similarly, a 1902 editorial argued that divorce was a threat to civilization, and nothing would be more likely to cure this ill than literature celebrating the sanctive and ever lasting virtues of self control, forbearance, devotion, and honor. Gilder characteristically saw a connection between a decline in morals and contemporary social problems and believed, conversely, that ennobling art could be a solution. Even in an artistic sense, The Century of the late nineteenth century was slow to adapt to the times. In 1889, after much resistance it became the last major periodical to include photographic illustrations. The editors remained attached to painted drawings, which The Century had become renowned for. In the pages of the magazine Gilder explained this preference by complaining of the trend toward the minute and literal representation of the visible world seen in photography, as opposed to painting, which preserved only that which deserved to be recorded for posterity. He went on to argue that the spread of printing and writing would have a similar vulgarizing and cheapening effect on the written word.Thus, the magazine maintained a great deal of self awareness about the causes of its declining influence. According to one modern author, in the first decade of the twentieth century, Gilder and the other editors continued to bear aloft the flame of the ideal in a changing era and gave no thought of cheapening the magazine to slow the steady drifting away of subscribers. After Gilder s death in 1909, The Century survived another two decades, but never regained its position as the leading American periodical.  Later years, 1909 1930  Robert Underwood Johnson was editor of The Century from Gilder s death in 1909 until his resignation in 1913. The 1910s were marked by financial difficulties and a further decline, as the magazine competed with other periodicals of both similar and lesser quality. The Century still attracted some of the best fiction authors of the day, however. H.G. Wells prophetic trilogy The World Set Free was serialized in the magazine in the first three issues of 1914.Glenn Frank became editor of The Century in 1921, until he left this position in 1925 to become president of the University of Wisconsin Madison. He wrote a series of editorials in which he laid out his thoughts on the future of Western civilization. The editorials used colorful language and usually stressed the idea that contemporary social problems had created a need for social engineering and government activism in both domestic and international affairs. For example, in 1923, Frank wrote that Senator Lodge and his isolationist supporters were the amoeba of politics, strange survivals from a prehistoric era of the lowest form of political intelligence. He later argued for what he called an intelligently flexible conservatism. While warning of what he referred to as the dangers of reactionaries on the right and radicals on the left, Frank was also known for expressing a great deal of optimism over the prospect of using the social sciences to improve human affairs. This kind of enthusiasm for reform through science rather than moral progress was a noticeable break from the philosophy of the magazine during the eras of Holland and Gilder. Other writers stressed similar themes throughout the Frank era. Reflecting the magazine s tilt to the left, a 1924 article called for industrial democracy to be adopted in American factories. Even the magazine's opposition to socialism was tempered, with Benjamin Stolberg arguing that the Red Scare had been an overreaction and that the Bolshevik threat to the United States had failed to materialize. The leftward shift during this time was not total, however, and, despite the tone that Frank's editorials gave to the magazine, The Century remained open to a wide variety of views. Noted conservative G.K. Chesterton, for example, contributed an essay that was highly critical of contemporary art.Frank was succeeded in 1925 by Hewitt H. Howland, who remained as editor until the magazine merged with The Forum in 1930.  Historical memoirs and major reporting   Civil War series  In 1877, Scribner's published a series of short accounts from those who took part in the Battle of Mobile Bay. The Century continued this kind of historical reporting with a first person account of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry it published in 1883, followed in the same issue by a rejoinder from Frank B. Sanborn, a self described radical abolitionist who had helped finance the mission.Gilder, himself a Union veteran, soon began regularly running the reflections of major Civil War figures. Originally planned to run for twelve months, the series drew so much interest that it lasted for three years and eventually led to a four volume book. Among the contributors to the series were Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George B. McClellan. As The Century tried to avoid bias and promote American unity, it also sought out and accepted accounts from those on the Confederate side, including the generals James Longstreet and P. G. T. Beauregard. The contributions led readers who had served in the war to submit unsolicited recollections and previously unpublished documents to the magazine, in addition to criticisms and rebuttals of published pieces. These submissions were so numerous that in 1885 The Century began to include them in a section titled Memoranda on the Civil War. The magazine had in effect become a forum for those who had fought each other in battle two decades earlier. In the pages of The Century, they could discuss their battles and mutually celebrate the bravery and heroism of both sides. The idea for soliciting recollections of the Civil War originally came from assistant editor Clarence Buel, who later wrote of the difficulties he had in going about convincing former military leaders to share their experiences. In fact, Grant would not agree to contribute to the series until the former general and president had run into financial difficulties. The editors became engrossed in the Civil War project, and sometimes took tours of the famous battle sites, bringing along commanders to explain their exploits and artists to draw sketches of the scenes for the magazine. The Century office became a regular meeting place for former comrades and adversaries, as reflected in a letter an excited Gilder sent to his wife exclaiming Grant one day and Beauregard the next! Before the publication of the series, Sherman was the only major figure of the war who had written a first person account. Afterwards, the works that Grant, Sheridan, and McClellan contributed to The Century led to books by each of those generals. As a result of the Civil War recollections, the number of subscribers to the magazine jumped to 250,000, a then unprecedented number for a magazine of its kind. Edward Weeks wrote that even by 1950 no quality magazine had ever had as many subscribers as The Century did in the 1880s, even though by that time the reading public had tripled in size. As of 1892, it was also the most widely circulated periodical of its price in England, with 20,000 subscribers.  Lincoln biography  The Century also acquired the rights to publish excerpts from the manuscript of a biography of President Abraham Lincoln written by his former secretaries John Hay and John G. Nicolay. The result was a series titled Abraham Lincoln: A History, which ran over three years. Decades later, The Century returned to Abraham Lincoln as a symbol of the republic's lost virtue. The February 1909 issue had a drawing of Lincoln on its cover and included twenty two portraits of the former president within its pages along with pictures of his life mask and a cast of his hands. Gilder's contribution to the issue, Lincoln the Leader , held the subject up as an ideal for modern statesmen to emulate.  Russian dissidents  In the late 1880s, George Kennan traveled to Russia and wrote a series of reports on the revolutionaries who had opposed Tsar Alexander II and been sent to prisons in Siberia. Seeing him as a writer sympathetic to the autocratic regime and hostile towards its opponents, the Russian government granted Kennan relative freedom to travel around the country. During his travels, however, the author changed his mind and wrote accounts that were highly critical of the regime. His reports included detailed illustrations of the suffering of those who suffered on account of their opposition to the government. In one article, Kennan told the story of how when the decision to assassinate the Tsar was made, 47 individuals volunteered to carry out the mission. Arguing that individuals fighting for civil liberties were rarely as fanatical as the Russian revolutionaries, Kennan wrote that he believed that it was the treatment of prisoners that led to such stringent opposition to the government. He noted that playing upon the deepest and most intense of human emotions as a means of extorting information from unwilling witnesses was routine in prisons holding political offenders. For example, a young woman was led to incriminate her loved ones by being told that they had already confessed. Sometimes, a revolutionary would be told that he was going to meet his mother, taken to her, and then stopped and later informed that he would only see her if he answered questions about his past activities. A twenty two year old mother was falsely led to believe that if she did not cooperate with the authorities her infant could be taken from her. The author also reported that it was common practice for prisoners to be left in solitary confinement for years while government officials searched the empire for evidence with which the offenders could be charged. Kennan came to see himself as a voice for the Russian liberals and was subsequently banned from the country. His writings on Russia were eventually published in a two volume book. A representative of the Russian government replied to Kennan's arguments in The Century in 1893 and the magazine subsequently published a rebuttal by the author.Kennan s writings on Russia and his subsequent activism were perhaps the main causes behind the rise of anti Tsar sentiment and sympathy for the revolutionary cause among late nineteenth century American elites. In addition to publishing magazine articles and books, the author also began to give popular lectures on the subject, including dozens of speeches in Chicago, New York City, and Boston. In order to make an impression on the crowd, Kennan would often appear in front of them in the ragged clothes and shackles of a Russian prisoner. This advocacy inspired the formation of a number of American organizations that took up the cause of the exiles, the most prominent of them being the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom.  Other histories and recollections  In the early 1900s, The Century continued to publish the writings of some of the most famous historians of the era along with first person accounts of those who had worked in the highest levels of government. Justin Harvey Smith published four articles on the American Revolution in The Century in 1902 and 1903. The next year, S. Weir Mitchell contributed a series on the life of George Washington as a young man. In addition to Theodore Roosevelt, The Century claimed a handful of other presidents as contributors. Grover Cleveland provided an account of perhaps the tensest moment of his two presidential administrations, the 1895 Venezuela border controversy with Britain. Andrew D. White contributed a series titled Chapters from My Diplomatic Life on his experiences serving in Germany and Russia. In September 1901, Woodrow Wilson wrote Edmund Burke and the French Revolution while still a professor at Princeton. In 1907 future President William Howard Taft wrote about the Panama Canal while serving as Secretary of War. Over the years, The Century also published first person accounts of individuals who had worked for various presidents. Col. William H. Cook, a bodyguard who served for over 50 years in the White House, shared his memories of the administrations of Andrew Johnson and Rutherford B. Hayes. Historian James Ford Rhodes also contributed an article on the Hayes Administration, which the editors called a kind of postscript to the last published volume of his history of the United States.  Science In its early years, Scribner's Monthly published a regular feature titled Nature and Science. Remaining consistent with its broad mission to educate the public, The Century published articles by some of the most prominent scientists and inventors of the day. Thomas Edison contributed to a symposium on roentgen rays and also once sat for an interview with the magazine. In the June 1900 issue, Nikola Tesla contributed a long article on the problem of increasing human energy. In a piece that combined the magazine's interests in political and scientific issues, geneticist and Marxist J.B.S. Haldane published a 1923 article on the societal implications of technological progress.  Literature and the arts Gilder has been called the literary arbiter of his time. Support for artistic excellence reflected his belief in the importance of self improvement and the celebration of high standards. The works that appeared in his time also reflected the magazine s moralism, as they banned references to sex, vulgarity, and insults to Christianity.The Century published the works of a number of major literary figures. In addition to the aforementioned works of Mark Twain and Henry James, pulp magazine author Ellis Parker Butler contributed 30 stories, articles and poems to the magazine between 1896 and 1913, including My Cyclone proof House , which appeared in the November 1896 issue. This short story was Butler's first piece published in a major magazine. His works were illustrated by such famous artists as Jay Hambidge, May Wilson Preston, Florence Scovel Shinn, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Frederic R. Gruger. The Century published a full color portrait of Butler in the December 1909 issue. The portrait was drawn by family friend Ernest L. Blumenschein. The magazine also published the work of Jack London and the first person account and ink drawings from Tierra del Fuego of American painter Rockwell Kent.Noted engraver Alexander Wilson Drake was a long time contributor to both The Century Magazine and its earlier incarnation as Scribner's Monthly. The Century Company produced a memorial edition of Alexander Wilson Drake's fiction and art titled Three Midnight Stories in 1916. The Century also employed many notable editorial cartoonists, including Oscar Cesare. Bohemian composer Anton n Dvo k was another noted contributor to The Century Magazine, writing during his stay at the National Conservatory in New York in the 1890s. In 1894, The Century Magazine published his fine tribute to fellow composer Franz Schubert.During the 1900s and 1910s the Anglo Canadian poet, story writer and essayist Marjorie Pickthall was a regular contributor to The Century Magazine.

            "text": "The Tesla World Light is an 8 minute 2017 black and white avant garde film by Montreal director Matthew Rankin imagining the latter days of inventor Nikola Tesla in 1905 in New York City. Rankin has stated that he was interested in exploring Tesla's optimistic utopian vision. The film is a fanciful amalgamation of elements from Tesla's life including his 1905 pleadings for J.P. Morgan to continue funding his World Wireless System and his love for a pigeon. Rankin has stated that everything in the film is drawn from something Tesla wrote or said. The film uses excerpts of Tesla's actual letters to Morgan, which the filmmaker found in the Library of Congress; even a reference to Tesla falling in love with an electric pigeon was based on an interview with Tesla, according to Rankin. The film is produced by Julie Roy for the National Film Board of Canada.  Technique To make the film, Rankin combines pixilation with a technique called light animation, which involves moving a light source in the frame to produce light rays a technique that he felt suited Tesla and his own experiments with electrical currents. Rankin estimates he used as many as 15,000 sparklers to produce such effects, along with fluorescent lamps, flashlights and LEDs. A shot of Tesla reading in front of his Tesla coil was made with an illuminated windmill, which was spun to create vivid rings of light.Rankin's avant garde approach was influenced by what he read in Tesla's autobiography, where the inventor reported seeing abstract shapes of light when feeling strong emotions. This led to Rankin to believe Tesla may have been prone to synesthesia and inspired the filmmaker to adopt a visual music approach, drawing on visual references from such artists as Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling, Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger.He worked with sound artist Sacha A. Ratcliffe, who recreated a device of Tesla's known as a Tesla Spirit Radio. It is a very strange device that can receive and transmit the sound of light waves. The effect is totally fascinating. The intensities and textures of the sound vary according to the light vibrations, and Sacha created much of the background sound in the film with this bizarre machine. So it s a film that s completely composed of light, from the images to the soundtrack, Rankin said.  Release The Tesla World Light had its world premiere in official competition on May 23 at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, as part of the International Critics' Week. The film has also been selected to the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.At the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, the film received an honourable mention in the Best Canadian Short Film category. In December, TIFF named the film to its annual Canada's Top Ten list of the ten best Canadian short films.The film won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards. It was submitted to the 2018 Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, but was not selected as a finalist.  References   External links Official website",

            "text": "Serbian Americans or American Serbs , are Americans of Serb ethnic ancestry. As of 2013, there were about 190,000 American citizens who identified as having Serb ancestry. However, the number may be significantly higher, as there were some 290,000 additional people who identified as Yugoslavs living in the United States.The group includes Serbian Americans living in the United States for one or several generations, dual Serbian American citizens, or any other Serbian Americans who consider themselves to be affiliated with both cultures or countries.  History  One of the first Serb immigrants to the United States was the settler George Fisher, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1815, moved to Mexico, fought in the Texan Revolution, and became a judge in California. Another notable early Serb in America was Basil Rosevic, who founded a shipping company, the Trans Oceanic Ship Lines, around the year 1800. In the early 1800s, many Serb sailors and fishermen from Montenegro and Herzegovina immigrated to New Orleans seeking employment. In 1841, Serbs founded the Greek Orthodox parish with Greek immigrants in New Orleans, further solidifying their presence in the region.Serbian Americans fought in the American Civil War, primarily on the side of the Confederacy, as most Serbs living in America at the time were in Louisiana and Mississippi. Several Confederate military units were formed by Serbs in Louisiana, such as the Cognevich Company , and the First and Second Slavonian Rifles. At least 400 Serbs fought in these three units during the Civil War. Several other known Serbian soldiers in the Civil War came from Alabama and Florida, specifically from Pensacola. Other Serbs settled in Alabama, Illinois, Mississippi and California, where they joined the Gold Rush. Serb immigrants first came in significant numbers to the United States in the late 19th century from the Adriatic regions of Austria Hungary and areas of the Balkans. During this time, most Serb immigrants to the United States settled in mid western industrial cities or in California, which had a climate similar to that of the Dalmatian coast. Serb men often found employment in mines, and numerous Serb families moved to mining towns throughout the country. Serbian miners and their families also settled in great numbers in Alaska, and the primary hub of Alaskan Serbs was in Juneau. In 1943, many Serbian American miners were killed in the Smith Mine disaster in Montana. The number of Serbs who immigrated to the United States is difficult to determine as Serb immigrants were often variously classified by their country of origin, thus as Turks, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians and Austro Hungarians. In the 1910 census, there were 16,676 Serbs from Austria Hungary, 4,321 from Serbia, and 3,724 from Montenegro.Serbian Americans volunteered in the First Balkan War. During World War I, as many as 15,000 Serbian American volunteers returned to the Balkans to fight for the Allied cause in their homeland. Serbs in the United States who did not volunteer to fight marched for the creation of Yugoslavia, sent aid to the Balkans through the Red Cross, formed a Serbian Relief Committee, and urged notable Americans to support the Serbian cause. Distinguished Serbian American scientist Mihajlo Pupin, a friend of US President Woodrow Wilson, led the Serbian National Defence , a Serbian American organization which collected money and attempted to influence American public opinion with regard to the Balkans. During World War I, Pupin's Consulate in New York served as a center of Serbian American diplomacy and volunteering of Serbian Americans to the Serbian front. In the 1912 18 period, thousands of Serbian American volunteers came from Alaska and California.After World War II many Serbs immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia after the country came under the authoritarian rule of Communist leader Josip Broz Tito. Since then, many Serbian American cultural and religious organizations have been formed in the United States. A number of Serbian American engineers worked on the Apollo program.With the fall of Communism and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, Serbs in the United States have established several interest groups, the most organized of which is the Serbian Unity Congress .  Alaska  Serbs have lived in Alaska since the earliest days of American settlement in the 19th century. Many Serbs came in the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s to seek fortune, just like they had done in the earlier California Gold Rush. The primary areas of Serbian and Montenegrin settlement were Juneau, Douglas, Fairbanks, and Sitka. Many Serbs settled in the Canadian Yukon during the gold rush as well, such as legendary prospector Black Mike Vojni . In 1893, Serbian miners in Alaska built the Orthodox Church in Juneau alongside the native Orthodox Tlingit people, who had been converted to Orthodoxy by the Russians decades before. By World War I there were two Serbian societies established in Juneau and in Douglas for the preservation of Serbian and Russian customs and heritage in Alaska. In 1905 a newspaper called The Serbian Montenegrin was founded in Douglas.St. Sava Church was a church of the Russian Mission that was located in Douglas, Alaska. Its construction was due, in no small part, to Fr. Sebastian Dabovich , who, in 1902, had been appointed Dean of the Sitka Deanery and the superintendent of Alaskan missions. Although under the Russian Orthodox Church, and a daughter parish of St. Nicholas Church in Juneau, St. Sebastian found it important that the Serbians that had come to the area mostly to work in mining had a church that was home to them. On July 23, 1903, Fr. Sebastian, along with Hieromonk Anthony and the priest Aleksandar Yaroshevich, consecrated the Church of St. Sava in Douglas. However, the sparse records that remain of this church indicate that by the 1920s it may have been sitting empty, and in 1937 a fire swept through Douglas, destroying most of the town, including St. Sava Church. It was not rebuilt. Serbs also made up a large number of the miners at the Treadwell gold mine until its collapse in 1917 and subsequent closure in 1922. In 1907, during the union conflicts involving the Western Federation of Miners, two Serb miners were killed in an underground shaft; one was a union member, one was not. The funeral procession for the nonunion man was accompanied by a march from the Serbian Slavonic Hall and they ran into the union group of Serbs. The union Serbs demanded the nonunion deceased not be buried in the same cemetery, and some two hundred Serbs of both sides filled the streets. The U.S. Marshal and neutral townsmen had to calm the group in order for the funeral procession to continue. In 1910, there was a massive explosion on the 1,100 foot level of the Mexican mine at Treadwell. 39 men were killed, 17 of whom were Serbian.During the First World War, many Serbian Americans volunteered to fight overseas, with thousands coming from Alaska.In 1930s and 40s Fairbanks, Yugoslav immigrants, mainly Serbs and Montenegrins, owned a great number of businesses and bars in the city. In between the world wars, many Serbian Alaskan men returned to Yugoslavia to find brides and bring them back to Alaska to start families.Today there is a vibrant Serbian community, particularly in Juneau, but Serbs can be found across the state.Recently, it has become commonplace for Serbian workers to come to Alaska annually to work for a few months in canneries, where food and accommodation is provided. These workers stay on temporary work visas, and speak English.  Publications  Serbian Americans have historically published and continue to publish a number of newspapers in both the Serbian and English languages. The oldest Serbian American newspaper currently in publication is the Pittsburgh based bilingual American Srbobran, which has been in circulation since 1906.  Notable Serbian newspapers published in the United States  Serb Sentinel , 1901 1923 Ujedinjeno srpstvo , 1905 1948 American Srbobran , 1906 present Radni ka Borba , 1907 1970 Srpska Borba , 1946 ? The Path of Orthodoxy , 1965 present Srpska zora , 1975 ? Ogledalo , 2003 present  Population   Demographics  A total of 187,738 citizens of the United States declared Serb ethnicity in 2010 . It is highly likely that among the citizens who declared Yugoslavian ethnicity are additional ethnic Serbs.Major centers of Serbian settlement in the United States include Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Milwaukee , Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and Jackson, California.Various ethnic organizations put the number of Serbian Americans at more than 350,000.

Mestrovitch. In 1905, Rade Grbitch, a Serb from South Chicago, was awarded the Medal of Honor by the United States Navy for heroic action on the Pacific Coast . The most decorated Serbian veterans of World War II were Mitchell Paige and John W.

            "text": "The Old City Hall is a complex of three adjacent buildings located in the Gradec neighbourhood in Zagreb, Croatia. The three buildings were joined in the late 19th century and since then, the complex has served as the place where all sessions of the city assembly are held.  History The earliest mention of the site dates from the 15th century, when a house on the same location was referred as the Gradec city council building , and in 1614 the Gradec magistrate Jakov Gasparini had the house adapted into a town hall. According to historical records, in 1787 the building had eight rooms, a kitchen, three jails, two shops and a cellar. In 1803 the municipal authorities bought the adjacent building owned by count Adam Or i , in order to expand the town hall. In 1832 local merchant Kristofor Stankovi had won the main prize at the Vienna lottery and then decided to invest his winnings in building a city theatre. City authorities then added a second floor to Or i 's one story house, torn down the original town hall and bought two land lots in today's Freudenreichova Street, which cleared enough space for the construction of a theatre, for which the cornerstone was laid on 12 August 1833. The theatre building, which was originally called City theatre and later People's theatre was a one story building with triple doors on Saints Cyril and Methodius Street, which featured a ballroom and a long gallery.The Croatian language was first heard in the theatre during an intermezzo of a German production, when Ljudevit Gaj's reveille Jo Hrvatska ni propala was performed, and the first play in Croatian, the Juran and Sofia or The Turks under Sisak: Heroic Play in Three Acts by Ivan Kukuljevi Sakcinski, was performed there on 10 June 1840. The first Croatian opera, Love and Malice by Vatroslav Lisinski, was also performed there on 28 March 1846. The ballroom also hosted a number of historically important sessions of the Croatian Parliament, most notably the one held on 23 October 1847 in which the parliament made Croatian language the official language in which to conduct its sessions.In 1895 the new theatre building was opened in the Lower Town area, and the theatre was moved there. Municipal government then took over the abandoned building and converted it in 1897. The city hall and the theatre building were merged, and the ballroom was converted to host sessions of the city assembly. In 1910 11 an additional two story building in Ku evi eva Street was added and in 1941 rooms in the attic space were converted into offices.In 1958 the city government moved to their present day building at Stjepan Radi Square but the old town hall continued to host city assembly sessions. The building underwent restoration between 1968 and 1975, including large scale conservation work done on the council hall and the three smaller halls on the first floor and two wedding halls on the second floor. In 1993 some municipal services were moved back to the old city hall building, including the urban planning institute's statistics department and the institute for the protection of cultural and natural heritage. In 1998 wedding halls were moved to the ground floor and in their former place on the second floor halls for special occasions named Kaptol and Gri were installed. The ground floor today houses the Kristofor Stankovi Art Gallery.  Plaques  There are two commemorative plaques on the walls of the Old City Hall. One was put there in 1917 by the Brethren of the Croatian Dragon, a cultural heritage society, enumerating several notable events held at the building, and the other depicts a relief of Nikola Tesla, commemorating his proposal to build an alternating current power station, which he made to the city council. The plaque quotes Tesla's statement, given in the building on 24 May 1892, which reads: As a son of this country, I consider it my duty to help the City of Zagreb in every way, either through counsel or through action . Tesla had visited Zagreb at the invitation of mayor Milan Amru and presented his idea of installing an electric street light system powered by a hydroelectric power plant at Plitvice Lakes. His idea was rejected and the city council chose to build a power plant near Ozalj instead.The Old City Hall was listed in the Croatian Ministry of Culture's Protected Cultural Heritage Registry in February 2003.

            "text": "Swami Vivekananda ; 12 January 1863 4 July 1902 , born Narendranath Datta , was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world; and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion. Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he began his famous speech with the words, Sisters and brothers of America..., before introducing Hinduism to Americans. He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as, an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament . After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco , both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in Western world. Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his country men, and found a way to travel to the United States, where he was highly successful. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission, to provide charity, social work and education. Vivekananda was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. He is regarded as a patriotic saint, and his birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.  Early life   Birth and childhood  Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta in a Bengali family at his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality. Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Narendra was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons .  Education  In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution . In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him, translating Herbert Spencer's book Education into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.William Hastie wrote, Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He is bound to make his mark in life .Narendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Several incidents have been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from Pickwick Papers. Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In another incident with Dr. Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologised to Dr. Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation, but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text, leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day, claiming that he had read them. The librarian refused to believe him until cross examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was being truthful.Some accounts have called Narendra a shrutidhara .  Initial spiritual forays  In 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge at some point before 1884 and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. From 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which denounces polytheism and the caste restriction, and a streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta. Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by unitarianism, strove towards a universalistic interpretation of Hinduism. His ideas were altered ... considerably by Debendranath Tagore, who had a romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the Vedas. Tagore also brought this neo Hinduism closer in line with western esotericism, a development which was furthered by Sen. Sen was influenced by transcendentalism, an American philosophical religious movement strongly connected with unitarianism, which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology. Sen strived to an accessible, non renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality , introducing lay systems of spiritual practice which can be regarded as an influence to the teachings Vivekananda later popularised in the west.Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God. He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come face to face with God , but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said My boy, you have the Yogi's eyes. According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense. According to De Michelis, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. Swami Medhananda agrees that the Brahmo Samaj was a formative influence, but that it was Narendra's momentous encounter with Ramakrishna that changed the course of his life by turning him away from Brahmoism. According to De Michelis, it was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.  Meeting Ramakrishna  In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion. While explaining the word trance in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students to visit Ramakrishna.They probably first met personally in November 1881, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later. At this time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture. According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.In late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna. This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life. Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar. He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as mere figments of imagination and hallucinations . As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of identity with the absolute as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea. Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: Try to see the truth from all angles , he replied.Narendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well to do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.One day, Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.In 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was transferred to Calcutta and to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him to care for the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.  Founding of Ramakrishna Math  After Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples. Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live. Many returned home, adopting a Grihastha way of life. Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by holy begging . The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna. Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practicing meditation and religious austerities every day. Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery: We underwent a lot of religious practice at the Baranagar Math. We used to get up at 3:00 am and become absorbed in japa and meditation. What a strong spirit of detachment we had in those days! We had no thought even as to whether the world existed or not. In 1887, Narendra compiled a Bengali song anthology named Sangeet Kalpataru with Vaishnav Charan Basak. Narendra collected and arranged most of the songs of this compilation, but could not finish the work of the book for unfavourable circumstances.  Monastic vows  In December 1886, the mother of Baburam invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village. Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend a few days. In Antpur, in the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows. They decided to live their lives as their master lived. Narendranath took the name Swami Vivekananda .  Travels in India  In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivr jaka the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go . His sole possessions were a kamandalu , staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha , Narendra travelled on foot and by railway . During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars and government officials. Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name Vivekananda , as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means the bliss of discerning wisdom, from Sanskrit viveka and nanda.  First visit to the West  Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan , China and Canada en route to the United States, reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893, where the Parliament of Religions took place in September 1893. The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C. Bonney, to gather all the religions of the world, and show the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life. It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair, and was an avant garde intellectual manifestation of ... cultic milieus, East and West, with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as being representative of Hinduism.Vivekananda wanted to join, but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a bona fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate. Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard. Vivekananda wrote of the professor, He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation . Vivekananda submitted an application, introducing himself as a monk 'of the oldest order of sanny sis ... founded by Sankara,' supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was also a member of the Parliament's selection committee, classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order. Hearing Vivekananda speak, Harvard psychology professor William James said, that man is simply a wonder for oratorical power. He is an honor to humanity.  Parliament of the World's Religions  The Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago, as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism. He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati and began his speech with Sisters and brothers of America! . At these words, Vivekananda received a two minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand. According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance . Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the Shiva mahimna stotram : As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee! and Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me. According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, it was only a short speech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament. Parliament President John Henry Barrows said, India, the Mother of religions was represented by Swami Vivekananda, the Orange monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors . Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the cyclonic monk from India . The New York Critique wrote, He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them . The New York Herald noted, Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation . American newspapers reported Vivekananda as the greatest figure in the parliament of religions and the most popular and influential man in the parliament . The Boston Evening Transcript reported that Vivekananda was a great favourite at the parliament... if he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded . He spoke several more times at receptions, the scientific section, and private homes on topics related to Hinduism, Buddhism and harmony among religions until the parliament ended on 27 September 1893. Vivekananda's speeches at the Parliament had the common theme of universality, emphasising religious tolerance. He soon became known as a handsome oriental and made a huge impression as an orator.  Lecture tours in the UK and US  After the Parliament of Religions, he toured many parts of the US as a guest. His popularity opened up new views for expanding on life and religion to thousands . During a question answer session at Brooklyn Ethical Society, he remarked, I have a message to the West as Buddha had a message to the East. Vivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, primarily in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. By spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health. He ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and yoga. Beginning in June 1895, Vivekananda gave private lectures to a dozen of his disciples at Thousand Island Park, New York for two months.During his first visit to the West he travelled to the UK twice, in 1895 and 1896, lecturing successfully there. In November 1895, he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita. During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max M ller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany, he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities ; he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk. Vivekananda's success led to a change in mission, namely the establishment of Vedanta centres in the West. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yogas model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realise the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism. In 1896, his book Raja Yoga was published, becoming an instant success; it was highly influential in the western understanding of yoga, in Elizabeth de Michelis's view marking the beginning of modern yoga.Vivekananda attracted followers and admirers in the US and Europe, including Josephine MacLeod, Betty Leggett, Lady Sandwich, William James, Josiah Royce, Robert G. Ingersoll, Lord Kelvin, Harriet Monroe, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Sarah Bernhardt, Nikola Tesla, Emma Calv and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz. He initiated several followers : Marie Louise became Swami Abhayananda, and Leon Landsberg became Swami Kripananda, so that they could continue the work of the mission of the Vedanta Society. This society still is filled with foreign nationals and is also located in Los Angeles. During his stay in America, Vivekananda was given land in the mountains to the southeast of San Jose, California to establish a retreat for Vedanta students. He called it Peace retreat , or, Shanti Asrama. The largest American centre is the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood, one of the twelve main centres. There is also a Vedanta Press in Hollywood which publishes books about Vedanta and English translations of Hindu scriptures and texts. Christina Greenstidel of Detroit was also initiated by Vivekananda with a mantra and she became Sister Christine, and they established a close father daughter relationship.From the West, Vivekananda revived his work in India. He regularly corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes of the town of Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying Ramakrishna, O Lord! unless you can do some good to the poor . In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical Brahmavadin to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in Brahmavadin in 1899. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way, they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted the rest of her life to the education of Indian women and India's independence.  Back in India  The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon on 15 January 1897, and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East. From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him. From Madras , he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora. While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule. These lectures, published as Lectures from Colombo to Almora, demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology.On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service. Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga, and its governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math . Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at Belur Math. Vivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the Himalayas , the Advaita Ashrama and another in Madras . Two journals were founded: Prabuddha Bharata in English and Udbhodan in Bengali. That year, famine relief work was begun by Swami Akhandananda in the Murshidabad district.Vivekananda earlier inspired Jamsetji Tata to set up a research and educational institution when they travelled together from Yokohama to Chicago on Vivekananda's first visit to the West in 1893. Tata now asked him to head his Research Institute of Science; Vivekananda declined the offer, citing a conflict with his spiritual interests . He visited Punjab, attempting to mediate an ideological conflict between Arya Samaj and sanatan . After brief visits to Lahore, Delhi and Khetri, Vivekananda returned to Calcutta in January 1898. He consolidated the work of the math and trained disciples for several months. Vivekananda composed Khandana Bhava Bandhana , a prayer song dedicated to Ramakrishna, in 1898.  Second visit to the West and final years  Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health restricted his activity.  Death On 4 July 1902 , Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla Yajur Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasam dhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra being pierced when he attained mahasam dhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.  Teachings and philosophy  While synthesizing and popularizing various strands of Hindu thought, most notably classical yoga and Vedanta, Vivekananda was influenced by western ideas such as Universalism, via Unitarian missionaries who collaborated with the Brahmo Samaj. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry, and a streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta . He propagated the idea that the divine, the absolute, exists within all human beings regardless of social status , and that seeing the divine as the essence of others will promote love and social harmony . Via his affiliations with Keshub Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, the Freemasonry lodge, the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, and Sen's Band of Hope, Vivekananda became acquainted with Western esotericism.He was also influenced by Ramakrishna, who gradually brought Narendra to a Vedanta based worldview that provides the ontological basis for ' ivaj ne j ver sev ', the spiritual practice of serving human beings as actual manifestations of God. Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo Vedanta reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non dualism, viewing Brahman as one without a second, yet both qualified, saguna, and qualityless, nirguna. Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation, showing the influence of classical yoga: Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy by one, or more, or all of these and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details. Vivekananda's emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In line with Advaita Vedanta texts like D g D ya Viveka and Vedantasara , Vivekananda saw samadhi as a means to attain liberation.Vivekananda popularized the notion of involution, a term which Vivekananda probably took from western Theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, in addition to Darwin's notion of evolution, and possibly referring to the Samkhya term s tkarya. Theosophic ideas on involution has much in common with theories of the descent of God in Gnosticism, Kabbalah, and other esoteric schools. According to Meera Nanda, Vivekananda uses the word involution exactly how it appears in Theosophy: the descent, or the involvement, of divine cosnciousness into matter. With spirit, Vivekananda refers to prana or purusha, derived from Samkhya and classical yoga as presented by Patanjali in the Yoga sutras.Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddh . Vivekananda supported brahmacharya, believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.Vivekananda's acquaintance with Western esotericism made him very successful in Western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his Western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with Western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his four yoga's model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realize the divine force within which is central to modern Western esotericism. In 1896, his book Raja Yoga was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the Western understanding of yoga.Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest .  Influence and legacy   Neo Vedanta  Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo Vedanta, a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy. His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India, and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, Transcendental Meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self improvement in the West. Agehananda Bharati explained, ...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly . Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism are different paths to the same goal. However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism.  Indian nationalism  In the background of emerging nationalism in British ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal. In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India . Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually. Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition .  Name giving  In September 2010, the then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India before the current President Ram Nath Kovind, approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of 1 billion , with objectives including: involving youth with competitions, essays, discussions and study circles and publishing Vivekananda's works in a number of languages. In 2011, the West Bengal Police Training College was renamed the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy, West Bengal. The state technical university in Chhattisgarh has been named the Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University. In 2012, the Raipur airport was renamed Swami Vivekananda Airport.  Celebrations  While National Youth Day in India is observed on his birthday, 12 January, the day he delivered his masterful speech at the Parliament of Religions, 11 September 1893, is World Brotherhood Day . The 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration.  Movies  Indian film director Utpal Sinha made a film, The Light: Swami Vivekananda as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary. Other Indian films about his life include: Swamiji by Amar Mullick, Swami Vivekananda by Amar Mullick, Birieswar Vivekananda by Modhu Bose, Life and Message of Swami Vivekananda documentary film by Bimal Roy, Swami Vivekananda by G. V. Iyer, Swamiji laser light film by Manick Sorcar. Sound of Joy, an Indian 3D animated short film directed by Sukankan Roy depicts the spiritual journey of Vivekananda. It won the National Film Award for Best Non Feature Animation Film in 2014.  Works   Lectures  Although Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali, he was not a thorough scholar, and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were mainly delivered ... impromptu and with little preparation . His main work, Raja Yoga, consists of talks he delivered in New York.  Literary works  Bartaman Bharat meaning Present Day India is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him, which was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every Indian as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste.

            "text": "Belgrade ; names in other languages is the capital and largest city in Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade. It is the third largest of all cities on the Danube river. Belgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the world. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin a culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid n. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid 2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi , and then his successor ura Brankovi returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Ottoman Habsburg wars. In the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade again was named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro Hungarian territories becoming part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings, and the tark Arena, one of the indoor arenas with the largest capacity in Europe. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the Danube River Conference of 1948, the first Non Aligned Movement Summit , the first major gathering of the OSCE , Eurovision Song Contest , as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships , UEFA Euro , Summer Universiade and EuroBasket three times .  History   Prehistory  Chipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago. The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star evo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star evo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star evo. The Star evo culture was succeeded by the Vin a culture , a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star evo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region . The Vin a culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin a culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin a, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human dated to before 5000 BC was discovered in 1890.  Antiquity  Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid n . In 34 33 BC, the Roman army reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid 2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full fledged colonia by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus , was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum ; the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.  Middle Ages  In 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius . In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire. The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N ndorfeh rv r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins. King Stefan Dragutin received Belgrade from his father in law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa and Kosovo field , Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.The northern regions of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi , the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi . Lazarevi built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor ura Brankovi , returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N ndorfeh rv r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.  Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions  Seven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade , and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. In retribution, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra ar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times , headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.  Principality and Kingdom of Serbia  At the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral , completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign , Prince Milo Obrenovi pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space , however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries old Donja ar ija and Gornja ar ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters . The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali pa ina, Reis efendijina, Jahja pa ina, Bajram begova, and Laz Had i Mahmudova. Following the ukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi 's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged underwent similar changes. In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi while riding in a carriage in his country residence.With the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni , Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants . Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria Hungary.The first ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr Carr, a representative of the Lumi re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.  World War I: German Austrian invasion  The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.  Kingdom of Yugoslavia  After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan evo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 , and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08 a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan evo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.  World War II: German invasion  On 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d' tat led by Air Force commander General Du an Simovi , who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime carried out the Genocide of Serbs. During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major arko Todorovi from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade . Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.  Socialist Yugoslavia  When the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre.In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police. In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.  Breakup of Yugoslavia  On 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra kovi were held in the city against Slobodan Milo evi . According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran in i to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo evi as a part of the Otpor! movement.  Development  In 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Around 3.5 billion was to be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.In addition to Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where apartment and office buildings were under construction to support the burgeoning Belgrade IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players. In September 2020, there were around 2000 active construction sites in Belgrade.  Geography   Topography  Belgrade lies 116.75 m above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja a, Kote and Bor a, also merged with the city, while Pan evo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 km2 , while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 . On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m . The mountains of Avala and Kosmaj lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus. One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30 of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20 . Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi njica, Vin a and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava , which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo dovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda. Landslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90 . They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo , ukovac and Kalvarija. However, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90 , is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system . The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.  Climate  Belgrade has a humid subtropical climate , according to K ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 C in January to 23.0 C in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 C .

            "text": "John Ernst Worrell Keely was a fraudulent American inventor from Philadelphia who claimed to have discovered a new motive power which was originally described as vaporic or etheric force, and later as an unnamed force based on vibratory sympathy , by which he produced interatomic ether from water and air. Despite numerous requests from the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, which had been established to produce a practicable motor based on his work, he consistently refused to reveal to them the principles on which his motor operated, and also repeatedly refused demands to produce a marketable product by claiming that he needed to perform more experiments. He secured substantial investments from many people, including John Jacob Astor IV.  Biography Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, John Keely was orphaned in early childhood and was raised by his grandparents. Before becoming an inventor, he worked as a member of a theatrical orchestra, a painter, a carpenter, a carnival barker, and as a mechanic.  Career In 1872 Keely invited scientists to a demonstration at his laboratory at 1422 North Twentieth Street Philadelphia, of a machine which he asserted was motivated by a new and previously unknown force. Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the musical vibrations of tuning forks and that music could resonate with atoms or with the aether. Public interest was aroused and within a few months the Keely Motor Company was formed in New York, with a capital of 5,000,000, equivalent to 95 million in 2013.  Keely's theories  Keely delivered descriptions of the supposed principles of his process on various occasions. In 1884 following the demonstration of his Vaporic gun : Stripping the process of all technical terms, it is simply this: I take water and air, two mediums of different specific gravity, and produces from them by generation an effect under vibrations that liberates from the air and water an inter atomic ether. The energy of this ether is boundless and can hardly be comprehended. The specific gravity of the ether is about four times lighter than that of hydrogen gas, the lightest gas so far discovered. Following a demonstration in June 1885: It is an elaboration of interatomic ether by vibration. The atomic ether vibrates all around the molecules of matter. There is a magnetic force attached to it at the same time, and it assimilates with the molecular atomic aggregations that is, assimilates with a certain attractive force that it is hard to tell what it is. I call it a vibratory negative. It don't act like a magnet drawing metals toward it. There is a certain magnetic effect about it that causes it to adhere by vibratory rotation to different forms of matter that is the molecular, atomic, etheric, and ether etheric. The impulse is given by metallic impulses, the rotary power that is formed by etheric vibration that is the force that holds it in position. In the 19th century most physicists believed, incorrectly, that all space was filled with a medium called the Luminiferous aether , a hypothetical substance which was thought necessary for the transmission of electromagnetic waves and to the propagation of light, which was believed to be impossible in empty space.  Etheric generator  On November 10, 1874 Keely gave a demonstration of an etheric generator to a small group in Philadelphia. Keely blew into a nozzle for half a minute, then poured five gallons of tap water into the same nozzle. After some adjustments a pressure gauge indicated pressures of 10,000 psi which Keely said was evidence that the water had been disintegrated and a mysterious vapor had been liberated in the generator, capable of powering machinery. In subsequent demonstrations he kept changing the terminology he used, to vibratory generator to a hydro pneumatic pulsating vacu engine to quadruple negative harmonics . It was later reported that the witnesses of the demonstration were so impressed that they formed a stock company, purchased patent rights for the six New England states, and paid 50,000 in cash for their share in the invention.The New York Times reported in June 1875 that Keely's new motive power was generated from cold water and air and evolved into a vapor more powerful than steam, and considerably more economical . It reported that Keely refused to disclose what the vapor was or how it was generated until he had taken out patents in all the countries of the globe which issue patent rights which was estimated would cost around 30,000.Keely said that the discovery of this new energy source was accidental. He said that the apparatus by which it was generated was called a generator or multiplicator , from where it was then passed into a receiver and from there to the cylinders of a steam engine. The generator was reported as being about 3 ft , made of Austrian gunmetal in one piece, and holding about 10 or 12 gallons of water. Its inside was made up of cylindrical chambers connected by pipes and fitted with stopcocks and valves. The receiver or reservoir was about 40 in long by 6 in in diameter and connected to the generator by a 1 in diameter pipe. Keely claimed that his apparatus would generate his vapor from water solely by mechanical means without using any chemicals and claimed to be able to produce 2,000 psi in 5 seconds.  Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore  In 1881 Keely met Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, the wealthy widow of a Philadelphia industrialist who had the year before established the Bloomfield Moore art collection. Mrs Moore became acquainted with Keely through her interest in scientific subjects, and remained his friend and patron until his death. She invested 100,000 plus a monthly salary of 250 so that he could focus completely on the perfection of his motor and widely advocated him and his work, producing many articles and books.Her family did not approve of her assuming obligations which they believed the company should fulfill under its contract with Keely. She made an arrangement with Keely in 1890 to furnish him with an additional 2000 per month for his household and shop expenses and instruments, which was to expire when he had gained sufficient control of his unknown force to enable him to resume his work under the direction of the management of the company upon a provisional engine. This arrived in December 1890, when Mrs Bloomfield Moore handed over to the Directors bills that had been presented since the expiration of Mr. Keely's contract with her.  Stockholder suit  On December 14, 1881 the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company held a meeting at which a report was read that complained that while they had faith in the merits of Keely's invention, the inventor was unreasonably secretive of the principles and operating methods of his apparatus. He had assured them that the generator had been perfected a year before, and that the multiplicator was also now perfected, and they considered it only fair and reasonable that the secrets of the machinery be revealed to them. They recommended that some intelligent and trustworthy person be taken into Keely's confidence so that in the case of accident they would not be totally without a clue to the invention . The report complained at some length about Keely's uncommunicativeness and said that it was the experience of everyone who had come into contact with him over the previous ten years that any attempt at a serious investigation of his operations has been met on his part with deception and misrepresentation .Keely was reluctant to reveal his secrets, and filed a demurrer on January 20, 1882 to the bill in equity presented against him by the Keely Motor Company's stockholders. The demurrer was described as entirely technical, and gave a number of reasons why the court should not afford the plaintiffs the relief they sought. Argument was heard on the demurrer in Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas on March 27, when it was argued that the inventor could not be made to expose that which no one knew but himself and which was hidden in his own brain . However, Keely was overruled by Judge Pierce on April 1, 1882, who ordered him to make known his process in the way indicated in the bill filed by the Keely Motor Company .On May 24 Keely filed his answer to the stockholders' equity suit. He admitted the truth of the complainants' bill regarding the contract, and added that although, due to certain abstruse difficulties by reason of the nature and qualities of the said force , he had so far failed to bring his inventions into practical use, he believed he would ultimately succeed.In June 1882 a committee appointed by the Company's board of directors agreed that one William Boekel of Philadelphia was to be instructed by Mr. Keely in the construction and operation of his inventions .The annual meeting of the Company's stockholders on December 13, 1882 heard a report from Boekel in which he stated that what Keely claimed to have discovered was the fact that water in its natural state is capable of being, by vibratory motion, disintegrated so that its molecular structure is broken up, and there is evolved therefrom a permanent expansive gas or ether, which result is produced by mechanical action . Boekel said that it would be improper to describe the mechanism used, and added that Keely had discovered all that he had claimed. It was later discovered by a Times reporter in August that Boekel had not yet been entrusted with the secrets of the motor as promised by Keely, and that the inventor kept delaying matters by telling Boekel that he could explain it to him in less than two hours after it was completed, and that he had not done so already because the engine had not yet reached that state.On August 28, 1883 at the monthly meeting of the Company's directors, it was announced that Keely's engine would be ready for operation around the first week in September, and that a final inspection of it by the Trustees would be conducted on August 29, at which the stockholders were expected to be present. When the inspection was made the following day, however, Keely said that it would not be ready for another six weeks.On October 29, 1883 it was reported that the Company's stockholders were to bring another suit against the inventor in the name of the company for fulfilment of his many pledges . At a meeting of the Board of Directors the following day, Keely made a statement explaining his progress, saying that he was constructing a street chamber to hold his vapor and that when this was complete a demonstration would be given, and his explanation was voted very satisfactory by the directors.At the annual stockholders' meeting on December 12, 1883 a letter from Keely was read out, in which the inventor said that he could not see why he might not fulfil the shareholders' expectations in the next two months and suggested that the stockholders' meeting be postponed to February 1, 1884. This proposal met with some disagreement from some stockholders, and it was decided to give Keely no funds for the next 60 days. When the promised stockholders' meeting was held on February 1, 1884, another postponement was announced at Keely's request. A board meeting which took place on March 25, 1884 reported that the vibratory engine was finished, that the work of adjusting and focalizing is progressing rapidly , and that Keely had set the date for the demonstration of the motor to take place on or before April 10.  Vaporic gun  On September 20, 1884 Keely demonstrated a vaporic gun at Sandy Hook to a party of Government officials. He said that he had brought with him five gallons of vaporic force in a receiver which, if the experiments were successful, would show that no bogus aids had been used. The gun was described as a small gun with a 1.25 in bore, resting on wheels, with an iron receiver 4.5 ft long containing Keely's mysterious force connected to it by an iron wire tube 3 16 in diameter. Keely rammed a small lead ball about 5 oz in weight into the gun's muzzle, then tapped the iron receiver with a hammer. He explained that this was to stimulate the vibratory force . He then turned a handle and the ball was fired from the gun with a short, sharp report but no smoke and very little recoil. It was reported that the projectile had been fired a distance of 300 yd . More shots were fired and their velocity measured; one attained 482 ft s , another 492 ft s , and yet another 523 ft s . The gun was also tested by firing against three 3 in thick spruce planks and penetrated the first and went halfway through the second. Keely said that he had used a pressure of 7,000 psi and could use 30,000 psi.On the following day, Keely met with a reporter to whom he declared that his experimenting days were over and that complete success was close. He announced that his motor would be completed in less than two months and that he would then make a public exhibition of its powers.The vaporic gun failed to impress Lieutenant E.L. Zalinski, who had witnessed the demonstration. He told the President of the Keely Motor Company, A.R. Edey, that with the same apparatus he could perform the same experiments with compressed air, and go even further than Keely had gone. Edey said he would speak about it to Mr. Keely, but the offer was not accepted. Zalinski said that none of the experiments at Sandy Hook showed that Keely had discovered a new force.Zalinski later attended a demonstration at Keely's workshop in November, in place of Colonel John Hamilton. He later reported that he suggested to Keely that it would be a more complete test of his power if he would discharge a large reservoir which he showed his guests, and then recharge it using his generator. Keely declined to do this, on the grounds that it would take two hours despite his many statements that he could generate force in a few seconds and that the reservoir had been carefully negatized . Keely also claimed to have achieved pressures of 50,000 psi, and that he had broken all his pressure gauges. When Zalinski produced a pressure gauge he had brought with him capable of registering 10,000 psi and offered it to Keely, saying I would like to have you put it on, and break it for me , Keely was momentarily lost for words before saying, I do not believe in pressure gauges, anyhow.  June 1885 demonstration  On June 6, 1885 Keely gave what he called an exhibition of his motor at his workshop at North Twentieth Street, Philadelphia. Around 20 witnesses attended, including newspaper reporters, a mechanical engineer, and officers and stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. A reporter noticed a large iron globular object which he was told was a new engine which Keely was engaged in building.Keely assembled an apparatus on top of which was screwed a globe with several apertures to which tubes were fixed, leading to cylinders. A reporter asked if he could see the globe's contents, but Keely declined, saying that it would take too long, and that he wished to show results rather than the mechanism. Keely then proceeded by taking a violin bow and rubbing it across one of two large tuning forks which formed part of his apparatus. After making a minor adjustment to the device, he opened a stopcock leading into one of the cylinders and the witnesses heard a hiss as of escaping air . Keely told them that it was in fact etheric vapor , adding It ain't compressed air or any vapor having substance. The force was then used to lift some weights, and Keely claimed that he had about 22,000 psi of pressure at his disposal.A further demonstration was given, of a rotating iron globe suspended on an axle, which was used to saw some wood. The globe was not opened, Keely saying that it was hollow and empty, and his assistants saying that it contained some bits of mechanism . A skeptical reporter, who believed that it was in fact operating on compressed air, asked how long the engine could work. Keely replied that he had one run for 40 days, whereupon the reporter suggested he simply run it for half an hour, just making the globe rotate. Keely duly set the globe rotating, and it ran for less than 15 minutes, constantly decreasing in power, before he stopped it.On March 26, 1886 Keely performed a demonstration before a committee of scientists and engineers from New York, where he obtained a pressure of 2,700 psi apparently by using a single pint of water, and then doubled the pressure by adding more water. Keely claimed that the etheric force by which these results were obtained would be utilized as fully as possible in the 25,000 hp engine on which he was then working.The stockholders of the Keely Motor Company met on December 14, 1887, and expressed their confidence in Keely's ultimate success. Keely did not attend the meeting, but supplied a report in which he reviewed his efforts and experiments since 1882 and announced that he had abandoned etheric force in favor of a new force which was unnamed but which he said was based on vibratory sympathy .  Wilson suit  On January 3, 1888 an injunction was granted against Keely on behalf of complainant Bennett C. Wilson, who said that in 1863 he had entered into an agreement with Keely, whom he had originally engaged to varnish furniture. The agreement was that Wilson was to find tools and materials and pay the expenses of inventions made by Keely, Keely agreeing that all inventions so made, and patents obtained, should be equally owned by him and Wilson. On August 14, 1869 Keely assigned a half ownership in what was referred to as the Keely motor to Wilson, who claimed that Keely had then assigned all rights and title to the invention later that same month in return for funds.Wilson alleged that he had only recently become aware that the machine called the Keely motor was the same as the one constructed in 1869 and assigned to him. He asked for an injunction restraining Keely from removing the machine or altering its construction or mode of operation, and requested that an order also be made compelling Keely to exhibit to the complainant all models, machines, and drawings of the invention referred to in the assignments to Wilson, and that an order be made compelling Keely to fully disclose the invention and the mode of constructing and operating it.On April 7, a formal order was made directing Bennett Wilson, his attorney, and four experts, to make a full and detailed inspection of the Keely motor, its mode of construction, and principle of operation within 30 days. The four experts were named as Dr. Charles M. Cresson, Analytical Chemist of City and State Boards of Health; Thomas Shaw, mechanical engineer; William D. Marks, civil engineer and Professor of Dynamical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; and Jacob Naylor, iron founder and President of the Eighth National Bank. The result of the inspection was to make known only whether the present Keely motor was or was not the same apparatus that he was alleged to have assigned to Wilson in 1869.On September 18 it was revealed that Keely had not yet obeyed the court order, despite the time span having been increased to 60 days, and a lawyer representing Bennett Wilson said he believed Keely never would comply with the order and that he had never intended to do so. Finally, on November 17, 1888, Keely was jailed in Moyamensing Prison for contempt of court for refusing the court order to operate and explain the mode of operation of the Keely Motor. However, he was soon released on bail on November 20 by three judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.Finally, on January 28, 1889 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania handed down an opinion reversing the order committing Keely to prison for contempt, and ordered his discharge. The opinion declared that the order commanding Keely to exhibit, explain, and operate his motor was premature, and that the court had no right to enforce the order by committing Keely to jail for contempt.On March 28, 1889 Keely's counsel announced that the inventor had the missing link which was needed to make the vibratory resonator and ethereal generative evaporator a success. It was described as a copper tube in the form of a loop, with the ends welded together so that no joint could be seen, and had been made in copper due to that metal's resonant properties . A private demonstration of Keely's motor was promised as soon as the tube was adjusted , and was stated as likely to occur in a week or two .At the Keely Motor Company's stockholders' meeting in December, a report was read from Keely in which he discussed the difficulties he had had with the Board of Directors during 1889 and said that while the work of graduating or adjusting his provisional engine had not progressed as rapidly as he had expected, no serious obstacles had presented themselves, and there were no difficulties affecting the principle or essence of his work. While he could not give a timescale for when the graduation of the engine would be completed, Keely said that it would not be a protracted period, and that when it was finished, one or more engines would at once be ordered.In June 1895 the trade journal Electricity published a challenge to Keely, in which they said that they would undertake to repeat every phenomenon produced by Keely within 60 days. Keely ignored this challenge.After an absence of several years in England, Mrs Moore returned to the US to deal with litigation concerning her late husband's estate. Her advocacy of Keely and his inventions formed part of the case and she decided to strengthen her position by getting eminent physicists to examine his inventions. Among those invited were Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, both of whom declined the opportunity for various reasons.Keely again informed the directors of his company in early November 1895 that before the end of the year he would positively be all through with his work to prove conclusively that he has devised a practical commercial working engine operated by his new force.On November 14, it was reported that another meeting had been arranged between Keely and Mrs Bloomfield Moore and New York capitalists headed by John Jacob Astor IV, who were interested in the Keely Motor Company. It was reported the following week that Astor had purchased a large interest in the motor from a person who for some years past has been an enthusiastic advocate of M. Keely .Also in November 1895, Mrs Moore invited Addison B. Burk, president of the Spring Garden Institute to make an inspection. Burk asked if electrical engineer E. Alexander Scott, of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia, could accompany him, and this was agreed to. In the event, Scott took charge of the investigation as he was familiar with Keely and had talked to him in 1874.Scott made several visits to Keely's workshop, beginning on November 9, 1895, and was shown many demonstrations. Among these was a levitation experiment where heavy weights in sealed flasks of water were made to rise and fall in response to differently pitched sounds from a zither, to activate a globe liberator which then transmitted the aetheric force through a wire to the water container. This had been shown to many investors and investigators. Scott was accompanied by Burk on his second and third visits and when the two analysed what they had seen they concluded that compressed air had been used in nearly all the experiments, in some cases alongside another more powerful but hidden force. The demonstration with the rising and falling weights was powered by compressed air via a thin tube which Keely had assured Burk and Scott was a solid wire and which was a common feature in nearly every piece of apparatus in Keely's laboratory.Burk and Scott reported their findings to Mrs Moore, who was concerned by the negative report, and also by dismissive articles in the press. It was reported on March 22, 1896 that Mrs Bloomfield Moore had arranged with Professor Wentworth Lascelles Scott of London to investigate Keely's claims of etheric force and also to examine his other inventions. It was said that an important series of tests will be made in the presence of the scientist . Lascelles Scott was allowed to examine whatever he wanted and had complete instructions on its use from Keely. After spending a month investigating, Lascelles Scott stated to a meeting of the Franklin Institute that Keely has demonstrated to me, in a way which is absolutely unquestionable, the existence of a force hitherto unknown. Since Lascelles Scott and Alexander Scott disagreed, they were brought together to witness more demonstrations by Keely. Mrs Moore suggested that a definitive test would be to cut the wire that Scott alleged was in fact an air pipe, but Keely flatly refused to do so and Mrs Moore, her faith shaken, reduced Keely's monthly salary. On December 24, 1895 Mrs Bloomfield Moore said that due to the position taken by the managers of the old Keely Motor Company at the annual meeting, and the delay on the part of the stockholders in accepting his proposition for a reorganization, Keely had decided not to take out any patents on his inventions, and would instead adopt a royalty system in dealing with his inventions commercially. Mrs Moore said that at least 30 patents would be required, which would take much time and money which would be better used in developing Keely's system.On June 18, 1897 Keely demonstrated his new etheric engine to the General Manager of the Manhattan Elevated Railway, the Chief Engineer of Western Union, and a representative of the Metropolitan Traction Company. All were reported as being surprised at the force produced by Keely's new motor, but declined to express any opinion as to its value. The engine was reported as weighing about 200 lb and being capable of developing 10 hp.  Death Keely died at his home in Philadelphia from pneumonia on November 18, 1898. His will was admitted to probate on December 1, and bequeathed his entire estate of about 10,000 to his widow, Anna M. Keely, who was appointed his executor. The will made no reference to his motor.Keely is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The first meeting of the Keely Motor Company's stockholders following his death was held on December 20, 1898. Charles S. Hill, his widow's attorney, stated that Keely's secret did not exist in manuscript form, but that Keely had suggested before his death that an inventor, Thomas Burton Kinraide of Boston, was the one man who could successfully carry on his work. Hill then announced that he had a secret which he would pass on to only one person. This secret, he said, was of a nature to encourage the stockholders and to induce them to leave everything in Kinraide's hands for one year . John J. Smith, one of the Company's Directors, was appointed to confer with Hill, and later reported that the secret told to him by Hill offered great encouragement to the stockholders but did not divulge any further details.In January 1899 Kinraide had 20 large packing cases transported to his laboratory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, said to contain the material part of Keely's motor. Kinraide said that he had often talked with Keely about the principles of his invention and said that he felt he knew more about it than any other person. He was to continue with Keely's experiments at the request of Mr. and Mrs Keely. However, on May 6, 1899 it was reported that Kinraide had abandoned all work on the Keely motor and was to return all the machines and notes to the Keely Company. He stated that he wanted nothing more to do with the motor due to the notoriety caused him by the Philadelphia Press's report and when asked whether he thought the motor was a fraud simply replied that he had not arrived at any such conclusion and had decided to make no further investigations.  Philadelphia Press investigation  On January 19, 1899, The Philadelphia Press published an illustrated article detailing an investigation made by the newspaper of Keely's workshop, in which the Press contended that the investigation had clearly proven Keely's motor to have been a delusion and deception and that its alleged mysterious forces were the result of trickery.The investigation, which took a week, was assisted by consulting engineer Professor Carl Hering, Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania Professor Arthur W. Goodspeed, Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania Lightner Witmer, and Doctor M. G. Miller, who superintended digging operations. Electrical engineer Clarence B. Moore, the son of Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, was an observer. The scientists involved substantiated the report with signed statements. The floors of Keely's workshop were taken up and a brick wall was removed. Inside the wall they found mechanical belts linked to a silent water motor two floors below the laboratory. In the basement there was a three ton sphere of compressed air that ran the machines through hidden high pressure tubes and switches. The walls, ceilings and even solid beams were found to have concealed tubes. Journalists documented everything photographically to leave no room for doubt. Hering and Goodspeed were of the opinion that the tubing and the large steel sphere in the basement indicated the use of normal forces and possible deception, and Hering said in his signed statement that Keely had probably lied and deceived, and was satisfied that he had used highly compressed air to power his demonstrations.At a meeting of the Keely Motor Company's board on January 25, 1899, President B. L. Ackerman issued a statement denying the Philadelphia Press report. The statement claimed that the tubes mentioned in the report had been discarded by Keely years before, and that in all his experiments since 1887 only solid wires had been used. Up to that time, it was stated, Keely had been working on a theory of etheric or vaporic force, and used the tubes to convey this force, but after 1887 he was convinced that he had discovered what he called vibratory sympathy . A concealed electric wire discovered in Keely's workshop was described by Ackerman as the remains of the wires of a burglar alarm, and in no way connected with the force used by Keely's motor. The statement denied all assertions that Keely was an imposter, and declared that there was no trickery in any of the results that Keely had claimed to have obtained.  Present day A model of Keely's engine was in the collection of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and an Etheric Force Machine of his dating from 1878 is in the American Precision Museum in Windsor, Vermont. In 2005, Jeff and Rita Behary found the original glass plate negatives of the Keely Motor taken by Thomas Burton Kinraide in his Jamaica Plain home Ravenscroft. They show the contents of the Keely Motor and are the last known photos of the motor ever taken.  References   External links  Etheric Force Machine at the American Precision Museum",

It is the oldest medal in this field of engineering. The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, small gold replica, certificate, and honorarium. The medal may only be awarded to a new leap breakthrough in the technological area of science.  Background The Edison Medal, named after the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison, was created on 11 February 1904 by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. Other recipients of the Edison Medal include George Westinghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, Michael I. Pupin, Robert A. Millikan , and Vannevar Bush. A complete and authoritative list is published by the IEEE online.After the merger of AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers , in 1963, to form the IEEE, it was decided that IRE's Medal of Honor would be presented as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal. Eleven persons with an exceptional career in electrical engineering received both the IEEE Edison Medal and the IEEE Medal of Honor, namely Edwin Howard Armstrong, Ernst Alexanderson, Mihajlo Pupin, Arthur E. Kennelly, Vladimir K. Zworykin, John R. Pierce, Sidney Darlington, James L. Flanagan, Nick Holonyak, Robert H. Dennard, Dave Forney, and Kees Schouhamer Immink.

            "text": "The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe is a nonprofit organization established to develop a regional science and technology center, museum and makerspace at the site of Nikola Tesla's former Wardenclyffe laboratory on Long Island, New York. The center had raised money through crowdfunding to purchase the property. In 2018, the Wardenclyffe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History   Early history of the site  Tesla's design for Wardenclyffe grew out of his experiments begun in the early 1890s up through his large scale experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899. After Tesla returned to New York City from Colorado Springs in 1900 he sought venture capitalists to fund what he thought was revolutionary wireless communication and electric power delivery system using the Earth as the conductor. At the end of 1900 he gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan who agreed to fund a pilot project based on Tesla's theories capable of transmitting messages, telephony, and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. Morgan was to receive a controlling share in the company as well as half of all the patent income. Tesla's decision in July 1901 to scale up the facility and add his ideas of wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's new radio based telegraph system was met with Morgan's refusal to fund the changes. Wardenclyffe construction started towards the end of 1901 and continued for the next 3 years. Tesla built his wireless plant on a cleared section of land outside Shoreham on Long Island Sound, part of a 200 acres plot purchased from land developer James S. Warden who was building a resort community known as Wardenclyffe On Sound. The plant included a Stanford White designed 94 by 94 ft brick building, a wood framed tower 186 feet tall with a 68 feet in diameter cupola on top, and a 120 feet shaft sunk into the ground with sixteen iron pipes driven one length after another 300 feet below the shaft in order for the machine, in Tesla's words, to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver. In June 1902 Tesla started to move his laboratory from Manhattan into a partially completed Wardenclyffe but funding problems continued to plague the project with prospective investors unable or unwilling to invest and a 1903 downturn on Wall Street. In May 1905, Tesla's patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a severe reduction in the funds he had to put toward the Wardenclyffe Project. By 1905 1906 most of the site's activity had to be shut down. Attempts to resurrect the project failed and the facility was abandoned, never to become operational. In an attempt to satisfy Tesla's debts, the tower was demolished for scrap in 1917 and the property taken in foreclosure in 1922.  Commercial industrial use  The laboratory building and grounds were used for commercial business until 1987, when the last company ceased business operations there. For 50 years, Wardenclyffe was a processing facility producing photography supplies. Many buildings were added to the site and the land it occupies has been trimmed down to 16 acres , but the Stanford White designed 94 by 94 ft brick building remains standing to this day. Eventually the site was turned into a Superfund hazardous waste site, taking years to clean up.  Preservation initiative  In 1994, acting on the advice of the President's Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, a formal nomination process was initiated by the Tesla Wardenclyffe Project seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe laboratory office building and the Tesla Tower Foundation on both the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places. This would result in the creation of a monument to Tesla out of the Wardenclyffe site itself.As of August 2012, the site was owned by Agfa.  Fundraising effort  Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of web cartoon The Oatmeal, joined forces in 2012 to honor the Father of the Electric Age , by preserving the Wardenclyffe facility as a science center and museum. They initiated the Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum fund raising campaign on the Indiegogo crowdfunding site, to raise funding to buy the Wardenclyffe property and restore the facility. The project reached its goal of raising 850,000 within a week, after a 33,333 donation from the producers of the Tesla film Fragments from Olympus: The Vision of Nikola Tesla put them over the top. The campaign also attracted donations from benefactors such as Elon Musk.The money raised within one week was enough to get a matching grant from the state of New York, allowing the project to be able to meet the seller's asking price of 1.6 million. Including the grant, the crowdfunding campaign raised approximately 1,700,000 in six days, with the campaign originally slated to run 45 days.On May 2, 2013, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe announced that they had purchased the 15.69 acre laboratory site from Agfa Corporation and will begin to raise about 10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy. On September 23, 2013, the president of Serbia, Tomislav Nikoli , unveiled a monument to Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site. Nikoli said that he had planned to push for the monument to be displayed at the United Nations, but chose Wardenclyffe once he learned it had been purchased for the center.On May 13, 2014, The Oatmeal published a comic called What It's Like to Own a Model S, Part 2, in which he requested a further donation of 8 million from Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk in order to propel the museum toward completion. The next day, Musk stated on Twitter that he would be happy to help. On July 10, 2014, during a 158th birthday celebration for Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site, it was announced that Musk would donate 1 million toward funding the museum, as well as having a Tesla Motors supercharging station installed onsite.In July 2018, the Wardenclyffe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.On December 19, 2019, the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe was awarded a 750,000 Regional Economic Development Council grant from New York State to transform the only existing laboratory of inventor Nikola Tesla into three unique attractions: a museum honoring Tesla and his legacy; a center for education and research; and an entrepreneur and technologist innovation program.  Programs and exhibits  Wardenclyffe is not currently open to the public year round, but the center offers seasonal events on the grounds as well as traveling educational programs, film screenings and exhibits throughout the year.Future expansion of the educational programs is slated to include science teacher associations, conferences, symposia, field trips, associations with science competitions, and other science programs. Planned permanent exhibits include a Tesla exhibit, exploratorium type exhibits, and a living museum.

            "text": "My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla is a book compiled and edited by Ben Johnston detailing the work of Nikola Tesla. The content was largely drawn from a series of articles that Nikola Tesla had written for Electrical Experimenter magazine in 1919, when he was 63 years old. Tesla's personal account is divided into six chapters covering different periods of his life: My Early Life, My First Efforts At Invention, My Later Endeavors, The Discovery of the Rotating Magnetic Field, The Discovery of the Tesla Coil and Transformer, The Magnifying Transmitter, and The Art of Telautomatics.  Publication history Tesla's autobiography was first published as a six part 1919 series in the Electrical Experimenter magazine, in the February June, and October issues. The series was republished as Moji Pronalasci My Inventions, kolska Knjiga, Zagreb, 1977, on the occasion of Tesla's 120th anniversary, with side by side English and Serbo Croatian translations by Tomo Bosanac and Vanja Aljinovi , Branimira Vali , ed. It is presently available in book form, My Inventions : The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, Hart Brothers, Williston, Vermont, 1982, giovanni Herran. Figures with an 18 page introduction by Ben Johnston. Hugo Gernsback also wrote his own introduction to the series which was published in the January 1919 issue.  The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla is the renamed Part One, The Life of Tesla by Tesla. The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla was published by Kolmogorov Smirnov Publishing, and subsequently became the first online version of Nikola Tesla's Autobiography. It was transcribed by John Rolad Penner in 1994 1 from a small typed booklet, then photocopied and stapled. The booklet includes no means of contacting the publisher, although the name 'Kolmogorov Smirnov Publishing' appears after the title page. The only form of date identification is the hand written purchase date: April 29, 1978. The text was first made available on GEnie in 1995 under the GNU General Public License, and from there, soon began to propagate onto the Internet.Although it is the first electronic version of Tesla's autobiography available online it contains many significant errors carried over from the original photocopied text. Online Internet scrutiny has subsequently revealed numerous omissions and additions that did not appear in the original serial text published in Electrical Experimenter magazine.The original six part series published in Electrical Experimenter Magazine in 1919 has been republished in book form as: My Inventions, The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla . A nearly unabridged version of My Inventions in various file formats is also freely available in electronic form at www.tfcbooks.com special mi link.htm. It supersedes the earlier corrupted text.

            "text": "The war of the currents was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s; arc lamp street lighting running on high voltage alternating current , and large scale low voltage direct current indoor incandescent lighting being marketed by Thomas Edison's company. In 1886, the Edison system was faced with new competition: an alternating current system developed by George Westinghouse's company that used transformers to step down from a high voltage so AC could be used for indoor lighting. Using high voltage allowed an AC system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations. As the use of AC spread rapidly, the Edison Electric Light Company claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous, and that the design was inferior to, and infringed on the patents behind, their direct current system. In the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole mounted high voltage AC lines, attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that used them. In June of that year Harold P. Brown, a New York electrical engineer, claimed the AC based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high voltage systems installed in a slipshod manner. Brown also claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents, with technical assistance from Edison Electric. The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. Both also colluded with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator. By the early 1890s the war was winding down. Further deaths caused by AC lines in New York City forced electric companies to fix safety problems. Mergers reduced competition between companies, including the merger of Edison Electric with their chief AC rival, Thomson Houston, forming General Electric in 1892. The new company now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and won the major part of the contract to build Niagara Falls hydroelectric project later that year . DC commercial power distribution systems declined rapidly in numbers throughout the 20th century; the last DC system in New York City was shut down in 2007.  Background  The war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; arc lighting running on alternating current and incandescent lighting running on direct current. Both were supplanting gas lighting systems, with arc lighting taking over large area street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential indoor lighting.  Arc lighting  By the late 1870s, arc lamp systems were beginning to be installed in cities, powered by central generating plants. Arc lighting was capable of lighting streets, factory yards, or the interior of large buildings. Arc lamp systems used high voltages to supply current to multiple series connected lamps, and some ran better on alternating current.1880 saw the installation of large scale arc lighting systems in several US cities including a central station set up by the Brush Electric Company in December 1880 to supply a 2 mile length of Broadway in New York City with a 3,500 volt demonstration arc lighting system. The disadvantages of arc lighting were: it was maintenance intensive, buzzed, flickered, constituted a fire hazard, was really only suitable for outdoor lighting, and, at the high voltages used, was dangerous to work with.  Edison's DC company  In 1878 inventor Thomas Edison saw a market for a system that could bring electric lighting directly into a customer's business or home, a niche not served by arc lighting systems. By 1882 the investor owned utility Edison Illuminating Company was established in New York City. Edison designed his utility to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.  AC transformer development in Europe  Alternating current had been under development with contributions by Guillaume Duchenne , the dynamo work of Z nobe Gramme, Ganz Works , Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti , Lucien Gaulard, and Galileo Ferraris. Starting in the 1880s alternating current gained its key advantage over direct current with the development of functional transformers that allowed the voltage to be stepped up to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use. The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to 7 mile long circuits.Using induction coils to transfer power between electrical circuits had been around for 40 years with Pavel Yablochkov using them in his lighting system in 1876 and Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs using the principle to create a step down transformer in 1882, but the design was not very efficient. A prototype of the high efficiency, closed core shunt connection transformer was made by the Hungarian Z.B.D. team at Ganz Works in 1884. The new Z.B.D. transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. Transformers in use today are designed based on principles discovered by the three engineers. Their patents included another major related innovation: the use of parallel connected power distribution. Ott Bl thy also invented the first AC electricity meter. The reliability of this type of AC technology received impetus after the Ganz Works electrified Rome, a large metropolis, in 1886.  Westinghouse enters the AC business  In North America the inventor and entrepreneur George Westinghouse entered the electric lighting business in 1884 when he started to develop a DC system and hired William Stanley, Jr. to work on it. Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal Engineering. He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater economies of scale could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well as lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a step down transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents. The Edison DC system of centralized DC plants with their short transmission range also meant there was a patchwork of un supplied customers between Edison's plants that Westinghouse could easily supply with AC power. Westinghouse purchased the US patents rights to the Gaulard Gibbs transformer and imported several of those as well as Siemens AC generators to begin experimenting with an AC based lighting system in Pittsburgh. William Stanley used the Gaulard Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The Westinghouse Electric Company was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location. By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and Oliver B. Shallenberger had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in Buffalo, New York.  The spread of AC  By the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts had built 22 power stations. Thomson Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their Sawyer Man incandescent bulb patent. Besides Thomson Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time included the United States Illuminating Company and the Waterhouse Electric Light Company. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.  Safety concerns  Elihu Thomson of Thomson Houston was concerned about AC safety and put a great deal of effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have. Thomson also worried about what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installation until a safer transformer could be developed.Due to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground. The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6,000 volts. Insulation on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value as a molasses covered rag , and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time. A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an eyesore, New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.  Edison's anti AC stance  As AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison's low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison's own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison's sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president Edward Hibberd Johnson pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid sized cities. Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea. After Westinghouse installed his first large scale system, Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically. Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system. Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system and he worried that a death caused by a mis installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general. Edison's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture. Edison was also of the opinion that DC was a superior system and inferior AC technology was being used by other companies as a way to get around his DC patents.In February 1888 Edison Electric president Edward Johnson published an 84 page pamphlet titled A Warning from the Edison Electric Light Company and sent it to newspapers and to companies that had purchased or were planning to purchase electrical equipment from Edison competitors, including Westinghouse and Thomson Houston, stating that the competitors were infringing on Edison's incandescent light and other electrical patents. It warned that purchasers could find themselves on the losing side of a court case if those patents were upheld. The pamphlet also emphasized the safety and efficiency of direct current, with the claim DC had not caused a single death, and included newspaper stories of accidental electrocutions caused by alternating current.  Execution by electricity  As arc lighting systems spread so did stories of how the high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead. One such story in 1881 of a drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, New York dentist Alfred P. Southwick to seek some application for the curious phenomenon. He worked with local physician George E. Fell and the Buffalo ASPCA, electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs, to come up with a method to euthanize animals via electricity. Southwick's 1882 and 1883 articles on how electrocution could be a replacement for hanging, using a restraint similar to a dental chair caught the attention of New York State politicians who, following a series of botched hangings, were desperately seeking an alternative. An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor David B. Hill, which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.There were early indications that this new form of execution would become mixed up with the war of currents. As part of their fact finding, the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including Elihu Thomson and Thomas Edison. In late 1887, when death penalty commission member Southwick contacted Edison, the inventor stated he was against capital punishment and wanted nothing to do with the matter. After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by 'alternating machines,' manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse . Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state's new form of execution. Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies was Edison's tongue in cheek answer.  Anti AC backlash As the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the deadly arc lighting current and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it. These deaths included a 15 year old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had been energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line; a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line; and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to death by wire incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.  Harold Brown's crusade  At this point an electrical engineer named Harold P. Brown, who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company, sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the New York Post claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current system being used. Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and damnable and asked why the public must submit to constant danger from sudden death just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system. At the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation. He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs . Edison thanked him but said My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time .On June 8, Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting's record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting voltage to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Brown's claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied. A July edition of The Electrical Journal covered Brown's appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC and noted that: The battle of the currents is being fought this week in New York. At a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown's criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.  Brown's demonstrations  Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments. Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant Arthur Kennelly. Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current. After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College. With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1,000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC. Brown wrote to a colleague that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts was unsuccessful but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.  Collusion with Edison  What brought Brown to the forefront of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear, but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown. Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings who came up with the idea of using Brown and several New York physicians to attack Westinghouse and the other AC companies in retaliation for what Hastings thought were unscrupulous bids by Westinghouse for lighting contracts in Denver and Minneapolis. Hasting brought Brown and Edison together and was in continual contact with Brown. Edison Electric seemed to be footing the bill for some of Brown's publications on the dangers of AC. In addition, Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of Scranton, Pennsylvania recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC. Some of this collusion was exposed in letters stolen from Brown's office and published in August 1889.  Patents and mergers  During this period Westinghouse continued to pour money and engineering resources into the goal of building a completely integrated AC system. To gain control of the Sawyer Man lamp patents he bought Consolidated Electric Light in 1887. He bought the Waterhouse Electric Light Company in 1888 and the United States Illuminating Company in 1890, giving Westinghouse their own arc lighting systems as well as control over all the major incandescent lamp patents not controlled by Edison. In April 1888 Westinghouse engineer Oliver B. Shallenberger developed an induction meter that used a rotating magnetic field for measuring alternating current, giving the company a way to calculate how much electricity a customer used. In July 1888 Westinghouse paid a substantial amount to license Nikola Tesla's US patents for a poly phase AC induction motor and obtained a patent option on Galileo Ferraris' induction motor design. Although the acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, the general shortage of cash the company was going through by 1890 meant development had to be put on hold for a while. The difficulties of obtaining funding for such a capital intensive business was becoming a serious problem for the company and 1890 saw the first of several attempts by investor J. P. Morgan to take over Westinghouse Electric.Thomson Houston was continuing to expand, buying seven smaller electric companies including a purchase of the Brush Electric Company in 1889. By 1890 Thomson Houston controlled the majority of the arc lighting systems in the US and a collection of its own US AC patents. Several of the business deals between Thomson Houston and Westinghouse fell apart and in April 1888 a judge rolled back part of Westinghouse's original Gaulard Gibbs patent, stating it only covered transformers linked in series.With the help of the financier Henry Villard the Edison group of companies also went through a series of mergers: Edison Lamp Company, a lamp manufacturer in East Newark, New Jersey; Edison Machine Works, a manufacturer of dynamos and large electric motors in Schenectady, New York; Bergmann Company, a manufacturer of electric lighting fixtures, sockets, and other electric lighting devices; and Edison Electric Light Company, the patent holding company and the financial arm backed by J.P. Morgan and the Vanderbilt family for Edison's lighting experiments, merged. The new company, Edison General Electric Company, was formed in January 1889 with the help of Drexel, Morgan Co. and Grosvenor Lowrey with Villard as president. It later included the Sprague Electric Railway Motor Company.  The peak of the war Through the fall of 1888 a battle of words with Brown specifically attacking Westinghouse continued to escalate. In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown's assertion in the pages of the Electrical Engineer that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.  Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair  Although New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns. The New York Medico Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.After the Medico Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman Frederick Peterson, who had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned with some committee members pointing out that Brown's experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3000 volts although the type of electricity, direct current or alternating current, was not determined. In order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory. There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico Legal Society's December meeting recommended the use of 1000 1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current. On December 13 in a letter to the New York Times, Westinghouse spelled out where Brown's experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown's December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses. Westinghouse declined the offer. In March 1889 when members of the Medico Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance. Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test. They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests. Also in March, Superintendent of Prisons Austin Lathrop asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment. The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind the scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson Houston. Thomson Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson Houston AC generators. Thomson Houston president Charles Coffin had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company's equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse's sales claim of manufacturing 50 more efficient generators was false.That spring Brown published The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current detailing the animal experiments done at Edison's lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier than DC. This 61 page professionally printed booklet was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5000 inhabitants.In May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named William Kemmler, there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the New York Times as to what to call the then new form of execution. The term Westinghoused was put forward as well as Gerrycide , and Browned . The Times hated the word that was eventually adopted, electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by pretentious ignoramuses . One of Edison's lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison's preference for dynamort, ampermort and electromort were not good terms but thought Westinghoused was the best choice.  The Kemmler appeal  William Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected lawyer who filed the appeal, William Bourke Cockran, had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.During fact finding hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross examiner and orator to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower current DC and high current AC. When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct industrial espionage. Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the wizard of Menlo Park that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.After the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler's appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler's appeal on May 23, 1890.When the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging. George Westinghouse commented: They would have done better using an axe.  Brown's collusion exposed  On August 25, 1889 the New York Sun ran a story headlined: For Shame, Brown! Disgraceful Facts About the Electric Killing Scheme; Queer Work for a State's Expert; Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another The story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's collusion with Thomson Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received 5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of Missouri , Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.Brown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.  The Electric Wire Panic  1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor Hugh J. Grant, in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office . On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.Feeks' public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the Electric Wire Panic . The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, Westinghouse having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks' death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary. Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks' death, pointing out men's lives were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with manslaughter. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans Times Picayune noted Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed. Harold Brown's reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines. At the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the North American Review titled The Dangers of Electric Lighting . Edison put forward the view that burying the high voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a constant menace that could short with other lines threatening people's homes and lives. He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.George Westinghouse was suddenly put in the role of a villain trying to defend pole mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe and fumbled at reporters' questions trying to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous. The next month he did better in his response printed in the North American Review, pointing out that his AC transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting versus only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in home deaths attributed to AC current.The crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York aldermen due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground. The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness. The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the New York Supreme Court in December. The AC lines were cut down keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter since little had been done by the overpaid Tammany Hall city supervisors who were supposed to see to building the underground subways to house them.  The current war ends Even with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business. Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric. In 1890 he told president Henry Villard he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time. Edison's dogmatic anti AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 Edison Machine Works began developing AC based equipment. With Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger. Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson Houston, which was now Edison General Electric's biggest competitor. Thomson Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles. Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger. As a committee of financiers, which included J.P. Morgan, worked on the deal in early 1892 things went against Villard. In Morgan's view Thomson Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson Houston in control of the new company, now called General Electric . Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened. The fifteen electric companies that existed five years before had merged down to two; General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business. From this point on General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems. Edison put on a brave face noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.  Aftermath  Even though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger, the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger. Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered universal system these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of rotary converters and motor generators that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid. These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded. In May 1892 Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe and effective highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at Niagara Falls. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field due partly to Charles Proteus Steinmetz, a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.A three phase three wire transmission system had already been deployed in Europe at the International Electro Technical Exhibition of 1891, where Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky used this system to transmit electric power over a distance of 176 km with 75 efficiency. In 1891 he also created a three phase transformer, the short circuited induction motor and designed the world's first three phase hydroelectric power plant. Patent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing agreement between the two companies that remained in force for 11 years.In 1897 Edison sold his remaining stock in Edison Electric Illuminating of New York to finance his iron ore refining prototype plant. In 1908 Edison said to George Stanley, son of AC transformer inventor William Stanley, Jr., Tell your father I was wrong , probably admitting he had underestimated the developmental potential of alternating current.  Remnant and existent DC systems  Some cities continued to use DC well into the 20th century. For example, central Helsinki had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A mercury arc valve rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances used by Boston University students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. New York City's electric utility company, Consolidated Edison, continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The New Yorker Hotel, constructed in 1929, had a large direct current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating current service until well into the 1960s. This was the building in which AC pioneer Nikola Tesla spent his last years, and where he died in 1943. New York City's Broadway theaters continued to use DC services until 1975, requiring the use of outmoded manual resistance dimmer boards operated by several stagehands. This practice ended when the musical A Chorus Line introduced computerized lighting control and thyristor dimmers to Broadway, and New York theaters were finally converted to AC.In January 1998, Consolidated Edison started to eliminate DC service. At that time there were 4,600 DC customers. By 2006, there were only 60 customers using DC service, and on November 14, 2007, the last direct current distribution by Con Edison was shut down. Customers still using DC were provided with on site AC to DC rectifiers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company still provides DC power to some locations in San Francisco, primarily for elevators, supplied by close to 200 rectifiers each providing power for 7 10 customers.The Central Electricity Generating Board in the UK maintained a 200 volt DC generating station at Bankside Power Station in London until 1981. It exclusively powered DC printing machinery in Fleet Street, then the heart of the UK's newspaper industry. It was decommissioned later in 1981 when the newspaper industry moved into the developing docklands area further down the river . High voltage direct current systems are used for bulk transmission of energy from distant generating stations or for interconnection of separate alternating current systems.

            "text": "The World Wireless System was a turn of the 20th century proposed telecommunications and electrical power delivery system designed by inventor Nikola Tesla based on his theories of using Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for the transmission of electric energy without wires on a global scale as well as point to point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting. He made public statements citing two related methods to accomplish this from the mid 1890s on. By the end of 1900 he had convinced banker J. P. Morgan to finance construction of a wireless station based on his ideas intended to transmit messages across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. His decision to change the design to include wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's new radio based telegraph system was met with Morgan's refusal to fund the changes. The project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational. During this period Tesla filed numerous patents associated with the basic functions of his system, including transformer design, transmission methods, tuning circuits, and methods of signaling. He also described a plan to have some thirty Wardenclyffe style telecommunications stations positioned around the world to be tied into existing telephone and telegraph systems. He would continue to elaborate to the press and in his writings for the next few decades on the system's capabilities and how it was superior to radio based systems. Despite claims of having carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission , there is no documentation he ever transmitted power beyond relatively short distances and modern scientific opinion is generally that his wireless power scheme would not have worked.  History   Origins  Tesla's ideas for a World Wireless system grew out of experiments beginning in the early 1890s after learning of Hertz's experiments with electromagnetic waves using induction coil transformers and spark gaps. He duplicated those experiments and then went on to improve Hertz's wireless transmitter, developing various alternator apparatus and his own high tension transformer, known as the Tesla coil. His primary interest in wireless phenomenon was as a power distribution system, early on pursuing wireless lighting. From 1891 on Tesla was delivering lectures including Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency in 1892 in London and in Paris and went on to demonstrate wireless lighting in 1893 including lighting Geissler tubes wirelessly.  One wire transmission  The first experiment was the operation of light and motive devices connected by a single wire to one terminal of a high frequency induction coil, performed during the 1891 New York City lecture at Columbia College. While a single terminal incandescent lamp connected to one of an induction coil's secondary terminals does not form a closed circuit in the ordinary acceptance of the term the circuit is closed in the sense that a return path is established back to the secondary by capacitive coupling or 'displacement current'. This is due to the lamp's filament or refractory button capacitance relative to the coil's free terminal and environment; the free terminal also has capacitance relative to the lamp and environment.  Wireless transmission  The second result demonstrated how energy can be made to go through space without any connecting wires. The wireless energy transmission effect involves the creation of an electric field between two metal plates, each being connected to one terminal of an induction coil's secondary winding. A gas discharge tube was used as a means of detecting the presence of the transmitted energy. Some demonstrations involved lighting of two partially evacuated tubes in an alternating electrostatic field while held in the hand of the experimenter.  Development  While formulating his theories in the early 1890s Tesla discarded the idea of using radio waves. He did not necessarily believe that radio waves existed as theorized by Maxwell, and he agreed with what most physicists were saying at the time: that radio waves would travel in a straight line in the same way that visible light travels, limiting their use for long range communication. He believed that transmitting electrical signals beyond a line of sight distance would require the use of planet Earth as a conducting medium to overcome this limitation. By the end of 1895, he made statements to the press about the possibility that Earth's electrical charge can be disturbed, and thereby electrical waves can be efficiently transmitted to any distance without the use of cables or wires , and that the electrical waves can be used to transmit intelligible signals and motive power. On April 11, 1896, he stated that messages might be conducted to all parts of the globe simultaneously using electric waves propagated through the atmosphere and even the ether beyond. In September 1897 he applied for a patent on a wireless power transmission scheme consisting of transmitting power between two tethered balloons maintained at 30,000 feet, an altitude where he thought a conductive layer should exist.Between 1895 and 1898, he constructed a large resonance transformer in his New York City lab called a magnifying transmitter to test his earth conduction theories. In 1899 he carried out large scale experiments at Colorado Springs, Colorado. Based on his measurements there, he concluded that the Earth was literally alive with electrical vibrations. He noted that lightning strikes indicate that the Earth is a large conductor with waves of energy traveling around it. He constructed a large magnifying transmitter measuring fifty one feet in diameter which could develop a working potential estimated at 3.5 million to 4 million volts and was capable of producing electrical discharges exceeding one hundred feet in length. With it he tested earth conduction and lit incandescent electric lamps adjacent to his lab in demonstrations of wireless power transmission. Upon returning to New York City from Colorado Springs in 1900 he sought venture capitalists to fund what he viewed as a revolutionary wireless communication and electric power delivery system using the Earth as the conductor. By the end of 1900 he had gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan who agreed to fund a pilot project which, based on his theories, would be capable of transmitting messages, telephony, and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea. Morgan was to receive a controlling share in the company as well as half of all the patent income. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's radio based telegraph system. Morgan refused to fund the changes and, when no additional investment capital became available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational. Construction of the Wardenclyffe wireless plant in Shoreham started towards the end of 1901 and continued for the next three years. The plant included a Stanford White designed 94 by 94 ft brick building, a wood framed tower 186 feet tall with a 68 feet in diameter cupola on top, and a 120 feet shaft sunk into the ground with sixteen iron pipes driven one length after another 300 feet below the shaft in order for the machine, in Tesla's words, to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver . Funding problems continued to plague Wardenclyffe and by 1905 1906 most of the site's activity had to be shut down.  Elements  Through the latter part of the 1890s and during the construction of Wardenclyffe, Tesla applied for patents covering the many elements that would make up his wireless system. The system he came up with was based on electrical conduction with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and as well as through a theorized conducting layer in the atmosphere. The design consisted of a grounded Tesla coil as a resonance transformer transmitter that he thought would be able to create a displacement of Earth's electric charge by alternately charging and discharging the oscillator's elevated terminal. This would work in conjunction with a second Tesla coil used in receive mode at a distant location, also with a grounded helical resonator and an elevated terminal. He believed that the placement of a grounded resonance transformer at another point on the Earth's surface in the role of a receiver tuned to the same frequency as the transmitter would allow electric current to flow through the Earth between the two. He also believed waves of electric current from the sending tower could be made to reflect back from the far side of the globe, resulting in amplified stationary waves of electric current that could be utilized at any point on the globe, localizing power delivery directly to the receiving station. Another aspect of his system was electricity returned via an equivalent electric displacement in the atmosphere via a charged conductive upper layer that he thought existed, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless transmission reception system developed by Mahlon Loomis. The current was thought to be usable at the receiver for telecommunications, and to drive electrical devices.Tesla told a friend his plans included the building of more than thirty transmission reception stations near major population centers around the world, with Wardenclyffe being the first. If plans had moved forward without interruption, the Long Island prototype would have been followed by a second plant built in the British Isles, perhaps on the west coast of Scotland near Glasgow. Each of these facilities was to include a large magnifying transmitter of a design loosely based on the apparatus assembled at the Colorado Springs experimental station in 1899.  Claimed applications  Tesla's description of his wireless transmission ideas in 1895 includes its humanitarian uses in bringing abundant electrical energy to remote underdeveloped parts of the world, as well as fostering closer communications amongst nations. In his June, 1900 Century Magazine article The Problem of Increasing Human Energy , he elaborated on the properties of the Earth and on the principles of a system which could use the Earth as the medium for communication and the transmission of power without wires. He wrote that communications at any distance was practicable. He also noted this same process could be used to locate maritime objects such as icebergs or ships at sea and that electrical movement of such magnitude could communicate with other planets.In 1909 Tesla stated: It will soon be possible, for instance, for a business man in New York to dictate instructions and have them appear instantly in type in London or elsewhere. He will be able to call up from his desk and talk with any telephone subscriber in the world. It will only be necessary to carry an inexpensive instrument not bigger than a watch, which will enable its bearer to hear anywhere on sea or land for distances of thousands of miles. One may listen or transmit speech or song to the uttermost parts of the world. He also believed that high potential electric current flowing through the upper atmosphere could make it glow, providing night time lighting for transoceanic shipping lanes.He elaborated on World Wireless in his 1919 Electrical Experimenter article titled The True Wireless , detailing its ability for long range telecommunications and putting forward his view that the prevailing theory of radio wave propagation was inaccurate. The Hertz wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while, but I do not hesitate to say that in a short time it will be recognized as one of the most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history.  Feasibility Tesla's demonstrations of wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs consisted of lighting incandescent electric lamps positioned nearby the structure housing his large experimental magnifying transmitter, with ranges out to 1,938 feet from the transmitter. There is little direct evidence of his having transmitted power beyond these photographically documented demonstrations. He would claim afterwards that he had carried on practical experiments in wireless transmission . He believed that he had achieved Earth electrical resonance that, according to his theory, would produce electrical effects at any terrestrial distance. There have been varied claims over the years regarding Tesla's accomplishments with his wireless system. His own notes from Colorado Springs are unclear as to whether he was ever successful at long range transmission. Tesla made a claim in a 1916 statement to attorney Drury W. Cooper that in 1899, he collected quantitative transmission reception data at a distance of about 10 miles . Tesla biographer John J. O'Neill made a claim in his 1944 book Prodigal Genius: The life of Nikola Tesla that in 1899 at Colorado Springs, Tesla lit 200 incandescent lamps at a distance of 26 miles .Scientist and engineers working in the field note that Tesla's ideas of transmitting large amounts of power long range would never have worked since he generally misunderstood the physics involved, over estimated the conductivity of the Earth and the atmosphere, and vastly underestimated the loss of power over distance.

            "text": "A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents,: ch1 and magnetic materials. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.: ch13 : 278 A permanent magnet's magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location will exert a force on a range of non magnetic materials by affecting the motion of their outer atomic electrons. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, and are created by electric currents such as those used in electromagnets, and by electric fields varying in time. Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, it is described mathematically by a function assigning a vector to each point of space, called a vector field. In electromagnetics, the term magnetic field is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols B and H. In the International System of Units, H, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of ampere per meter .: 22 B, magnetic flux density, is measured in tesla ,: 21 which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. H and B differ in how they account for magnetization. In a vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability,         B                     0             H       displaystyle mathbf B mu 0 mathbf H  ; but in a magnetized material, the terms differ by the material's magnetization at each point. Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin.: ch1 Magnetic fields and electric fields are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Magnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is conceptualized and investigated as magnetic circuits. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the solar wind and is important in navigation using a compass.  Description The force on an electric charge depends on its location, speed, and direction; two vector fields are used to describe this force.: ch1 The first is the electric field, which describes the force acting on a stationary charge and gives the component of the force that is independent of motion. The magnetic field, in contrast, describes the component of the force that is proportional to both the speed and direction of charged particles.: ch13 The field is defined by the Lorentz force law and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charge and the force it experiences. There are two different, but closely related vector fields which are both sometimes called the magnetic field written B and H. While both the best names for these fields and exact interpretation of what these fields represent has been the subject of long running debate, there is wide agreement about how the underlying physics work. Historically, the term magnetic field was reserved for H while using other terms for B, but many recent textbooks use the term magnetic field to describe B as well as or in place of H. There are many alternative names for both .  The B field  The magnetic field vector B at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the Lorentz force law, correctly predicts the force on a charged particle at that point:: 204 Here F is the force on the particle, q is the particle's electric charge, v, is the particle's velocity, and denotes the cross product. The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a mnemonic known as the right hand rule . Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field can distinguish between these, see Hall effect below. The first term in the Lorentz equation is from the theory of electrostatics, and says that a particle of charge q in an electric field E experiences an electric force: The second term is the magnetic force: Using the definition of the cross product, the magnetic force can also be written as a scalar equation:: 357 where Fmagnetic, v, and B are the scalar magnitude of their respective vectors, and is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The vector B is defined as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. In other words,: 173 4 T he command, Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at such and such a place, calls for the following operations: Take a particle of known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine E. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat with v in some other direction. Now find a B that makes the Lorentz force law fit all these results that is the magnetic field at the place in question. The B field can also be defined by the torque on a magnetic dipole, m.: 174 In SI units, B is measured in teslas . In Gaussian cgs units, B is measured in gauss . One nanotesla is equivalent to 1 gamma .  The H field  The magnetic H field is defined:: 269 : 192 : ch36 Where                0          displaystyle mu 0  is the vacuum permeability, and M is the magnetization vector. In a vacuum, B and H are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different . The H field is measured in amperes per metre in SI units, and in oersteds in cgs units.: 286  Measurement  An instrument used to measure the local magnetic field is known as a magnetometer. Important classes of magnetometers include using induction magnetometers which measure only varying magnetic fields, rotating coil magnetometers, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves. The finest precision for a magnetic field measurement was attained by Gravity Probe B at 5 aT .  Visualization  The field can be visualized by a set of magnetic field lines, that follow the direction of the field at each point. The lines can be constructed by measuring the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of points . Then, mark each location with an arrow pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. Connecting these arrows then forms a set of magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent a continuous distribution, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the number of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly translated to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.: 237 Various phenomena display magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to field lines . Magnetic field lines are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field. Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. Unlike poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; like poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.  Magnetic field of permanent magnets  Permanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole. The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's strength . The equations are non trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, m points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180 degrees. The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own m. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles. There were two simplified models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, H and B. Outside a material, though, the two are identical so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials. A realistic model of magnetism is more complicated than either of these models; neither model fully explains why materials are magnetic. The monopole model has no experimental support. Ampere's model explains some, but not all of a material's magnetic moment. Like Ampere's model predicts, the motion of electrons within an atom are connected to those electrons' orbital magnetic dipole moment, and these orbital moments do contribute to the magnetism seen at the macroscopic level. However, the motion of electrons is not classical, and the spin magnetic moment of electrons is also a significant contribution to the total moment of magnets.  Magnetic pole model  Historically, early physics textbooks would model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. At the microscopic level, this model contradicts the experimental evidence, and the pole model of magnetism is no longer the typical way to introduce the concept.: 204 However, it is still sometimes used as a macroscopic model for ferromagnetism due to its mathematical simplicity.In this model, a magnetic H field is produced by fictitious magnetic charges that are spread over the surface of each pole. These magnetic charges are in fact related to the magnetization field M. The H field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field E, which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all H field lines point away from the north pole while near the south pole all H field lines point toward the south pole . Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the H field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H field. In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qm separated by a small distance vector d, such that m qm d. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field H both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that H is opposite to the magnetization field M inside a permanent magnet. Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a magnetic charge density, the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents, nor the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism. The pole model usually treats magnetic charge as a mathematical abstraction, rather than a physical property of particles. However, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle that physically has only one magnetic pole . In other words, it would possess a magnetic charge analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end. Some theories have predicted the existence of magnetic monopoles, but so far, none have been observed.  Amperian loop model  In the model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is m IA where A is the area of the loop. These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B field. The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current I and an area a. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of: where the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area a has been reduced to zero and its current I increased to infinity such that the product m Ia is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein de Haas effect rotation by magnetization and its inverse, the Barnett effect or magnetization by rotation. Rotating the loop faster increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.  Interactions with magnets   Force between magnets  Specifying the force between two small magnets is quite complicated because it depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other. To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the magnetic pole model given above. In this model, the H field of one magnet pushes and pulls on both poles of a second magnet. If this H field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform , each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque. This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way. The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is:: Eq. 11.42 where the gradient is the change of the quantity m B per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of m B. The dot product m B mBcos , where m and B represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and is the angle between them. If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive and the gradient points uphill pulling the magnet into regions of higher B field . This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own m then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.  Magnetic torque on permanent magnets  If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a magnetic torque on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field. In terms of the pole model, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance between them. With the definition of m as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to  0 m H sin , where 0 is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring 4 10 7 V s and is the angle between H and m. Mathematically, the torque on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet: where represents the vector cross product. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field, since the cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction. Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.  Interactions with electric currents Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B fields.  Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents  All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the right hand grip rule . The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. Bending a current carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or solenoid enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an electromagnet, generating a strong, well controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil. The magnetic field generated by a steady current I is described by the Biot Savart law:: 224 where the integral sums over the wire length where vector d is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current I, 0 is the magnetic constant, r is the distance between the location of d and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and r is a unit vector in the direction of r. For example, in the case of a sufficiently long, straight wire, this becomes: where r r . The direction is tangent to a circle perpendicular to the wire according to the right hand rule.: 225 A slightly more general way of relating the current       I     displaystyle I  to the B field is through Amp re's law: where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and         I      enc          displaystyle I text enc  is the current enclosed by that loop. Amp re's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the B field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid. In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Amp re's law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and magnetism.  Force on moving charges and current   Force on a charged particle  A charged particle moving in a B field experiences a sideways force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and is given by where F is the force, q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the instantaneous velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field . The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.  Force on current carrying wire  The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the Laplace force. Consider a conductor of length , cross section A, and charge q due to electric current i. If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude B that makes an angle with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge q is so, for N charges where the force exerted on the conductor is where i nqvA.  Relation between H and B The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. The H field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of magnetization first.  Magnetization  The magnetization vector field M represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment m of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A m2, the SI unit of magnetization M is ampere per meter, identical to that of the H field. The magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called bound current. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet. Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law: where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and Ib is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop. In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive magnetic pole strength then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to: where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface S and qM is the magnetic charge enclosed by S. The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.  H field and magnetic materials  In SI units, the H field is related to the B field by In terms of the H field, Ampere's law is where If represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents.For the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition where Kf is the surface free current density and the unit normal                     n                     displaystyle hat mathbf n   points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.Similarly, a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the magnetic charges within that closed surface: which does not depend on the free currents. The H field, therefore, can be separated into two independent parts: where H0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents. The magnetic H field, therefore, re factors the bound current in terms of magnetic charges . The H field lines loop only around free current and, unlike the magnetic B field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.  Magnetism  Most materials respond to an applied B field by producing their own magnetization M and therefore their own B fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term magnetism describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior: Diamagnetic materials produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials and the closely related ferrimagnetic materials and antiferromagnetic materials can have a magnetization independent of an applied B field with a complex relationship between the two fields. Superconductors are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of M on B.In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization M is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that: where is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point in the same direction as B. These relations between B and H are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex B to H relation; see magnetic hysteresis.  Stored energy  Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field. For linear, non dispersive, materials , the energy density is: If there are no magnetic materials around then can be replaced by 0. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used. In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume W needed to cause a small change of magnetic field B is: Once the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.  Appearance in Maxwell's equations  Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its sources. These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up Maxwell's Equations. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism. The first property is the divergence of a vector field A,  A, which represents how A flows outward from a given point. As discussed above, a B field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B is zero. This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles. The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that  A represents how A curls or circulates around a given point. The result of the curl is called a circulation source . The equations for the curl of B and of E are called the Amp re Maxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively.  Gauss' law for magnetism  One important property of the B field produced this way is that magnetic B field lines neither start nor end ; a field line may only extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a closed curve, or follow a never ending path. Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet B field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. If a B field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the number of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to Gauss's law for magnetism: where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface S . Since dA points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for B field pointing out and negative for B field pointing in.  Faraday's Law  A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field . This is known as Faraday's law and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors. Mathematically, Faraday's law is: where             E          displaystyle mathcal E  is the electromotive force and is the magnetic flux the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. : 210 The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz's law. This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions.  Amp re's Law and Maxwell's correction  Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as Maxwell's correction to Amp re's law and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. The full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell Amp re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used. The Maxwell term is critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below. where J is the complete microscopic current density. As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric E field and an applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal bound charge and current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, H and D fields are used to re factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the free current density Jf: These equations are not any more general than the original equations . They also must be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between E and D. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.  Formulation in special relativity and quantum electrodynamics   Relativistic Electrodynamics   As different aspects of the same phenomenon  According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces. Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank 2 tensor, called the electromagnetic tensor. Changing reference frames mixes these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum, and energy into four momentum. Similarly, the energy stored in a magnetic field is mixed with the energy stored in an electric field in the electromagnetic stress energy tensor.  Magnetic vector potential  In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the magnetic vector potential A, and the electric scalar potential , are defined using gauge fixing such that: The vector potential, A given by this form may be interpreted as a generalized potential momentum per unit charge just as is interpreted as a generalized potential energy per unit charge. There are multiple choices one can make for the potential fields that satisfy the above condition. However, the choice of potentials is represented by its respective gauge condition. Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials in Lorentz gauge can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity. In relativity, A together with forms a four potential regardless of the gauge condition, analogous to the four momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.  Propagation of Electric and Magnetic fields  Special theory of relativity imposes the condition for events related by cause and effect to be time like separated, that is that causal efficacy propagates no faster than light. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism are be found to be in favor of this as electric and magnetic disturbances are found to travel at the speed of light in space. Electric and magnetic fields from classical electrodynamics obey the principle of locality in physics and are expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the cause of a measured field originated given that the influence of field travelled at speed of light. The retarded time for a point particle is given as solution of:         t      r             t                                 r                     r              s                               c          displaystyle t r mathbf t  frac mathbf r mathbf r s  c  where             t       r             textstyle t r  is retarded time or the time at which the source's contribution of the field originated,             r         s             textstyle r s  is the position vector of the particle as function of time,         r       textstyle mathbf r  is the point in space,         t       textstyle mathbf t  is the time at which fields are measured and       c     textstyle c  is the speed of light. The equation subtracts the time taken for light to travel from particle to the point in space from the time of measurement to find time of origin of the fields. The uniqueness of solution for             t       r             textstyle t r  for given         t       displaystyle mathbf t  ,         r       displaystyle mathbf r  and         r      s             displaystyle r s  is valid for charged particles moving slower than speed of light.  Magnetic field of arbitrary moving point charge  The solution of maxwell's equations for electric and magnetic field of a point charge is expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the particle in the past causes the field at the point, given that the influence travels across space at the speed of light. Any arbitrary motion of point charge causes electric and magnetic fields found by solving maxwell's equations using green's function for retarded potentials and hence finding the fields to be as follows:         A                                 0            c           4                                              r                          r                 s                                                 t           t        r                                                 s                   c               displaystyle mathbf A  frac mu 0 c 4 pi left mathbf r mathbf r s  right t t r  frac boldsymbol beta  s c varphi           B                            0              4                                                      2                             3                                       r                            r                  s                                               2                                              q                  n                  s                                                                                                     s                                                                                                                           3                                       r                            r                  s                                                        t           t        r                                    n              s                   c             E          displaystyle mathbf B  frac mu 0 4 pi left gamma 2 3 mathbf r mathbf r s 2  frac q mathbf n s times Big times dot boldsymbol beta  s  big  Big  3 mathbf r mathbf r s  right t t r  frac mathbf n s c times mathbf E  where              textstyle varphi  and         A          textstyle mathbf A  are electric scalar potential and magnetic vector potential in Lorentz gauge,       q     displaystyle q  is the charge of the point source,             n         s             textstyle n s  is a unit vector pointing from charged particle to the point in space,                      s             textstyle boldsymbol beta  s  is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light and              textstyle gamma  is the corresponding Lorentz factor. Hence by the principle of superposition, the fields of a system of charges also obey principle of locality.  Quantum electrodynamics  In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a classical field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction is quantum electrodynamics , which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the Standard Model of particle physics. In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles is computed using perturbation theory. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged. Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10 12 ; for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far. All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.  Uses and examples   Earth's magnetic field  The Earth's magnetic field is produced by convection of a liquid iron alloy in the outer core. In a dynamo process, the movements drive a feedback process in which electric currents create electric and magnetic fields that in turn act on the currents.The field at the surface of the Earth is approximately the same as if a giant bar magnet were positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11 off the rotational axis of the Earth . The north pole of a magnetic compass needle points roughly north, toward the North Magnetic Pole. However, because a magnetic pole is attracted to its opposite, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the geomagnetic field. This confusion in terminology arises because the pole of a magnet is defined by the geographical direction it points.Earth's magnetic field is not constant the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.  Rotating magnetic fields  The rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of alternating current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his and others' early AC electric motors. Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three wire arrangement with unequal currents. This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three phase systems dominate the world's electrical power supply systems. Synchronous motors use DC voltage fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled and induction motors use short circuited rotors following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force. In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin.  Hall effect  The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect. The Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors .  Magnetic circuits  An important use of H is in magnetic circuits where B H inside a linear material. Here, is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm's law J E, where J is the current density, is the conductance and E is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law is: where                 B          d        A       textstyle Phi int mathbf B cdot mathrm d mathbf A  is the magnetic flux in the circuit,       F          H          d               textstyle F int mathbf H cdot mathrm d boldsymbol ell  is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit, and Rm is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance Rm is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux. Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.  Largest magnetic fields  As of October 2018, The largest magnetic field produced over a macroscopic volume outside a lab setting is 2.8 kT . As of October 2018, the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory over a macroscopic volume was 1.2 kT by researchers at the University of Tokyo in 2018. The largest magnetic fields produced in a laboratory occur in particle accelerators, such as RHIC, inside the collisions of heavy ions, where microscopic fields reach 1014 T. Magnetars have the strongest known magnetic fields of any naturally occurring object, ranging from 0.1 to 100 GT .  History   Early developments  While magnets and some properties of magnetism were known to ancient societies, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points poles in analogy to Earth's poles. He also articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.Almost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus's work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.: 34 Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, De Magnete, helped to establish magnetism as a science.  Mathematical development  In 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law: 56 Charles Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that north and south poles cannot be separated.: 59 Building on this force between poles, Sim on Denis Poisson created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.: 64 In this model, a magnetic H field is produced by magnetic poles and magnetism is due to small pairs of north south magnetic poles. Three discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism. Hans Christian rsted demonstrated that a current carrying wire is surrounded by a circular magnetic field. Then Andr Marie Amp re showed that parallel wires with currents attract one another if the currents are in the same direction and repel if they are in opposite directions.: 87 Finally, Jean Baptiste Biot and F lix Savart announced empirical results about the forces that a current carrying long, straight wire exerted on a small magnet, determining the forces were inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance from the wire to the magnet.: 86 Laplace later deduced a law of force based on the differential action of a differential section of the wire, which became known as the Biot Savart law, as Laplace did not publish his findings.Extending these experiments, Amp re published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets: 88 and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model. Further, Amp re derived both Amp re's force law describing the force between two currents and Amp re's law, which, like the Biot Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp re introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.: 88 92 In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field, formulating what is now known as Faraday's law of induction.: 189 192 Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp re's force law.: 222 In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.: 225 In 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted H and B. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp re's model and induction.: 224 Further, he derived how H and B relate to each other and coined the term permeability.: 245 Between 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled On Physical Lines of Force in 1861. These equations were valid but incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz published papers in 1887 and 1888 experimentally confirming this fact.  Modern developments  In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor . Tesla received a patent for his electric motor in May 1888. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched rotating magnetic fields and subsequently published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin, just two months before Tesla was awarded his patent, in March 1888.The twentieth century showed that classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity, and extended classical electrodynamics to work with quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics, which first formalized the notion that electromagnetic field energy is quantized in the form of photons.

            "text": "Tesla, Inc. is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company headquartered in Austin, Texas. Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles , battery energy storage from home to grid scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market capitalization of more than US 840 billion. In 2021, the company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles and plug in electric vehicles, capturing 21 of the battery electric market and 14 of the plug in market . Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3.99 gigawatt hours installed in 2021. Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a 6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, in 2009. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Model Y crossover in 2020. The Model 3 is the all time bestselling plug in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally. Tesla's global sales were 936,222 cars in 2021, an 87 increase over the previous year, and cumulative sales totaled 3 million cars as of August 2022. In October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached 1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.  History   Founding  The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Eberhard and Tarpenning served as CEO and CFO, respectively. Eberhard said he wanted to build a car manufacturer that is also a technology company , with its core technologies as the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor .Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. In February 2004, the company raised 7.5 million in series A funding, including 6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received 100 million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla. J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as chief technical officer.A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel to call themselves co founders.  Roadster  Elon Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day to day business operations. The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of 13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team. Musk co led the third, 40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll. A fourth round worth 45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over 105 million.Tesla's first car, the Roadster, was officially revealed to the public on July 19, 2006, in Santa Monica, California, at a 350 person invitation only event held in Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO. Eberhard then took the title of President of Technology before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008. In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007, Ze'ev Drori became CEO and President. Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008. In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out.Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008.By January 2009, Tesla had raised 187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed 70 million of his own money to the company.In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive 465 million in interest bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the 8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology. Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with 12 million interest.  IPO, Model S, and Model X  In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for 42 million, and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S. On June 29, 2010, the company became a public company via an initial public offering on NASDAQ, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956. The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of 17.00 per share, raising 226 million.In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan. The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. The Model S was also the bestselling plug in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016.Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called hardware version 1 . In April 2015, Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall and Tesla Powerpack battery packs. The company received orders valued at 800 million within a week of the unveiling.Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, at which time it had 25,000 pre orders.  SolarCity and Model 3  In November 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, in an all stock 2.6 billion deal, and entered the photovoltaics market. The solar installation business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the Tesla Energy subsidiary. The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed.In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc., to better reflect the scope of its expanded business, which now included electric vehicles, battery energy storage systems, and solar power generation.That year Tesla also started its philanthropic effort. Tesla made multiple contributions of solar power to areas recovering from disasters in 2017, in particular installing a solar plus storage system to restore electricity at a hospital in Puerto Rico, following the destruction from Hurricane Maria. In July 2018, the company donated 37.5 million to kindergarten to 12th grade science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in Nevada.Tesla began selling its fourth vehicle model, the Model 3 sedan, in July 2017. The Model 3 was a cheaper vehicle compared to previous Tesla vehicles, and was intended for the mass market. It was highly anticipated, which prompted the company to try to speed up production. By August 2017, there were 455,000 reservations for the Model 3. The rollout was plagued by delays and production problems. This increased pressure on the company, which at this time was one of the most shorted companies in the market. In August 2018, CEO Elon Musk briefly considered taking Tesla private. The plan did not materialize, and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a securities fraud charge from the SEC. By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 was the world's best selling plug in electric car for the year.  Global expansion and Model Y  Tesla opened its first Gigafactory outside the United States in Shanghai, China, in 2019. Giga Shanghai was the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company, and was built in less than six months. The following year Tesla also started construction on a new Gigafactory near Berlin, Germany, and another in Texas, United States. In March 2020, Tesla began deliveries of its fifth vehicle model, the Model Y crossover.On January 10, 2020, Tesla reached a market capitalization of 86 billion, breaking the record for highest valuation of any American automaker. On June 10, 2020, Tesla's market capitalization surpassed those of BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen combined. The next month, Tesla reached a valuation of 206 billion, surpassing Toyota's 202 billion to become the world's most valuable automaker by market capitalization. On August 31, 2020, following this increase in value, Tesla had a 5 for 1 stock split.From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four profitable quarters in a row for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S P 500. Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020. It was the largest company ever added, and the sixth largest company in the index at the time of its inclusion. As investors tried to buy more shares as a result of this inclusion, some analysts, such as J.P. Morgan's Ryan Brinkman, suggested investors exercise caution as Tesla was dramatically overvalued. Throughout 2020, the share price of Tesla increased 740 , and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached 848 billion, more than the next nine largest automakers combined and making it the 5th most valuable company in the US.From 2015 to 2020, Tesla acquired companies including Riviera Tool, Grohmann Engineering, Perbix, Compass Automation, Hibar Systems, and German ATW Automation to advance Tesla's expertise in automation, along with Maxwell Technologies and SilLion to add to Tesla's abilities in battery technology. Grohmann and Maxwell would continue to operate as subsidiary companies, while the rest would be merged into Tesla. In July 2021, Musk acknowledged that Tesla had sold Maxwell to the former VP of sales for Maxwell.In January 2020, Tesla donated RMB 5,000,000 to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the COVID 19 pandemic in mainland China.In October 2020, Tesla told Electrek that it had dissolved its public relations department , becoming the first automaker to do so.Tesla hit its goal of building 0.5 million cars in 2020. The company ended the year with over 19 billion of cash, compared to 6.3 billion at the end of 2019.In February 2021, Tesla revealed that it had invested 1.5 billion in bitcoin in 2020 and on March 24 the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for vehicle purchases in the United States and stated that it would introduce bitcoin payment in other countries later that year. At the time, Musk tweeted that Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency. It was later revealed in financial documents that between January 1 and March 31, 2021, Tesla had made a 101 million profit on the sale of bitcoin. After 49 days of accepting the digital currency, the company reversed course on May 12, 2021, saying they would no longer take bitcoin due to concerns that mining the cryptocurrency was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels and climate change. The decision resulted in the price of bitcoin dropping around 12 on May 13. During a July bitcoin conference, Musk suggested Tesla could help bitcoin miners switch to renewable energy in the future and also stated at the same conference that if bitcoin mining reaches, and trends above 50 percent renewable energy usage, that Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin. The price for bitcoin rose after this announcement. In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75 of its bitcoin holdings. It was worth 936 million.After earlier disputes with California officials over COVID 19 restrictions, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from Palo Alto, California, to its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas. However, Musk stated that Tesla would continue to operate its Fremont factory in the San Francisco Bay Area, and will continue to expand in California. In September 2021, Tesla broke ground on a new battery factory in Lathrop, California, and signed a lease in October 2021 for additional office space in Palo Alto.Also in October 2021, Tesla's market capitalization reached 1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history, on news that car rental company Hertz had placed an order for 100,000 Tesla vehicles for its fleet.On March 22, 2022, Tesla launched its new car factory outside Berlin, with Chief Executive Elon Musk handing over the first deliveries to customers. The US carmaker's Giga Berlin plant is the largest for electric vehicles in Europe. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the public opening of the Giga Texas facility with its Cyber Rodeo event attended by an estimated 15,000 invitees.Musk said in an email sent to employees that he was reducing salaried headcount by 10 percent because the company had become overstaffed in many areas , adding that hourly headcount will increase. He also said in a tweet Tesla's total number of employees would increase over the next year, but said the number of salaried staff would remain fairly flat .In August 2022, Musk claimed that Tesla had made more than 3 million cars.  Automotive products  As of January 2022, Tesla offers four car models: Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y. Tesla's first vehicle, the first generation Tesla Roadster, is no longer sold. Tesla has plans for a second generation Roadster, a semi truck, and a pickup called the Cybertruck.  In production   Model S  The Model S is a five door liftback sedan. Deliveries began on June 22, 2012. The car became the first electric vehicle to top the monthly sales ranking in any country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. The Model S won the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, the 2013 World Green Car , Automobile magazine's 2013 Car of the Year , Time magazine's Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012 award, as well as the 2019 Motor Trend Ultimate Car of the Year .The Model S was the bestselling plug in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016, selling an estimated 50,931 units in 2016. By the end of 2017, it was the world's second best selling plug in electric car in history , with global sales of 200,000 units. In June 2020, Tesla announced that the Model S Long Range Plus had an EPA range of 402 miles , the highest of any battery electric vehicle at the time.  Model X  The Tesla Model X is a mid size crossover SUV. It is offered in 5 , 6 and 7 passenger configurations. The Model X was developed from the full sized sedan platform of the Model S. The rear passenger doors open vertically with an articulating falcon wing design. Deliveries started in September 2015. In 2016, after one full year on the market, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's bestselling plug in cars. The United States is its main market, with an estimated 57,327 units sold through September 2018.  Model 3  The Model 3 is a four door fastback sedan. Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on March 31, 2016. Potential customers began reserving spots earlier that day with a refundable deposit. One week after the unveiling, Tesla reported over 325,000 reservations. Bloomberg News claimed that, due to the number of reservations, the Model 3's unveiling was unique in the 100 year history of the mass market automobile. Limited vehicle production began in July 2017.Since March 2020, the Model 3 is the world's best selling electric car in history, and cumulative global sales passed the 1 million milestone in June 2021. The Model 3 has ranked as the world's best selling plug in electric car for four consecutive years, from 2018 to 2021, and also as the best selling plug in electric car in the United States since 2018. The Model 3 also set records in Norway and the Netherlands, as the best selling passenger car model in those countries in 2019.  Model Y  The Model Y is a compact crossover utility vehicle. The Model Y is built on a platform that shares many components with the Model 3. The car has up to three rows of seats , 68 cubic feet of cargo space , and has an EPA range of up to 326 miles .The Model Y was unveiled on March 14, 2019. Deliveries for the Model Y started on March 13, 2020. The Tesla Model Y is being manufactured at Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, as well as in Giga Shanghai in China. A version of the Model Y is also expected to be produced at Giga Berlin once the factory is open.  Future products   Roadster   In a surprise reveal at the end of the event that introduced the Tesla Semi on November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster. Musk said that the new model will have a range of 620 miles with the 200 kilowatt hours battery pack and will achieve 0 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds; it also will achieve 0 100 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds, and the top speed will be over 250 miles per hour . The SpaceX Package will include cold air thrusters that will increase the speed even more. The vehicle will have three electric motors allowing for all wheel drive and torque vectoring during cornering.At the time, the base price was set at 200,000, while the first 1,000 units will sell for 250,000. Reservations required a deposit of 50,000, and those who ordered the Founder's series paid the 250,000 in full upon ordering. Those who made a reservation at the event were allowed a test drive in the prototype. Deliveries are expected to start in 2023.  Tesla Semi  The Tesla Semi is an all electric Class 8 semi trailer truck announced in November 2017. Musk confirmed that two variants would be available: one with 300 miles and one with 500 miles of range. The Semi will be powered by four independent electric motors of the type used in the Tesla Model 3 and will include an extensive set of hardware sensors to enable it to stay in its own lane, a safe distance away from other vehicles, and later, when software and regulatory conditions allow, provide self driving operation on highways. Musk also announced that the company would be involved in installing a solar powered global network of Tesla Megachargers to make the Semi more attractive to potential long haul customers. A 30 minute charge would provide 400 miles of range.Musk initially said in 2017 that Semi deliveries would start in 2019 and be selling 100,000 trucks a year, but deliveries were later delayed to 2021 and then 2023. Part of the reason for the delays, according to Musk, is that the Semi includes five times more battery cells than their passenger cars, and the battery supply is not yet sufficient for both Tesla cars and the Semi.  Cybertruck  The Cybertruck is a pickup truck unveiled on November 21, 2019. Production has been delayed past 2022, and as of January 2022 is rumored to be early 2023. The truck's design had a mixed reception, and some Wall Street analysts questioned whether American pickup truck buyers will have interest in the Cybertruck. On September 22, 2020, Musk revealed roughly 600,000 Cybertruck preorders. James Goodwin, chief executive of ANCAP, said in 2019 that the design of the Cybertruck could pose safety risks, saying that the front would look like it's not very forgiving . After the Cybertruck's unveiling, Musk announced that the Tesla Cyberquad, an electric four wheel quad bike revealed alongside the Cybertruck, would be an optional accessory for Cybertruck buyers.  Discontinued   Tesla Roadster  The only discontinued Tesla vehicle model is the original Tesla Roadster. The Roadster was a two seater sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all electric car to use lithium ion battery cells and the first production all electric car to travel more than 200 miles per charge. It is also the first production car to be launched into space; it was carried into a Mars crossing orbit by a Falcon Heavy rocket test flight on February 6, 2018.  Other concepts  On July 20, 2016, Musk detailed his new master plan for Tesla. It includes more affordable cars produced in higher volume, solar roofs, mid size vehicles, SUVs and pickup trucks, as well as the refinement of autonomous vehicles and the creation of a sharing economy, in which cars can be active while the owner is not using them. Tesla's plan also indicated building a minibus on the Model X platform, but in May 2017, Musk indicated that he might favor a 10 12 passenger version of the Model X over a dedicated minibus design. Musk dashed hopes for a Tesla motorcycle, saying in 2018 we're not going to do motorcycles .Also in 2016, Musk revealed Tesla's intention to produce a car cheaper than the Model 3. In 2018, Musk indicated a plan to enter a new market segment, offering a compact hatchback in less than five years . In 2020, Musk said Tesla expects to have a 25,000 electric car within 3 years, which will basically be on par or slightly better than a comparable gasoline car .In April 2019, Musk announced Tesla's intention to launch an autonomous taxi service by the end of 2020 using more than 1 million Tesla vehicles. A year later, in April 2020, Musk stated Tesla would not make the end of 2020 deadline but said, we'll have the functionality necessary for full self driving by the end of the year.  Tesla Energy products  Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs solar energy generation systems and battery energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016.Tesla Energy's generation products include solar panels , the Tesla Solar Roof and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Other products include the Powerwall and the Powerpack and Megapack, which are large scale energy storage systems. Tesla Energy also develops software to allow customers to monitor and control their systems.In 2021, the company deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 345 megawatts, an increase of 68 over 2020, and deployed 3.99 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 32 over 2020.  Other services Tesla receives service revenue from its vehicle customers after their initial purchase; these revenues reached 1.47 billion in 2022 Q2. As of August 2020, those services include vehicle servicing, charging, insurance, software upgrades, and improved connectivity. In July 2021, Tesla made Full Self Driving available as a monthly subscription. Future services which have been discussed include paying for a Wi Fi hotspot in the car and the Tesla robotaxi network.  Charging   Supercharger network  In 2012, Tesla began building a network of 480 volt fast charging Supercharger stations. As of June 2022, Tesla operates 36,165 Superchargers in 3,971 stations worldwide . The Supercharger is a proprietary direct current technology that provides up to 250 kilowatts of power. All Tesla cars except the first generation Roadster come standard with hardware to charge at Superchargers. The navigation software in Tesla cars can recommend the fastest route for long distance travel, incorporating charging stops.Model S and X cars ordered before January 15, 2017, and between August 3, 2019, and May 26, 2020, received free unlimited supercharging. Model S and X cars ordered between January 15, 2017, and August 3, 2019, got 400 kWh of free Supercharging credits per year, which provides a range of roughly 1,000 miles per year . Subsequent Tesla models never received free unlimited supercharging.  Destination charging location network  In 2014, Tesla launched the Destination Charging location network by providing chargers to hotels, restaurants, shopping centers and resorts to provide on site vehicle charging at twice the power of a typical home charging station.Destination chargers are installed free of charge by Tesla certified contractors; the locations originally were required to provide the electricity at no cost to their customers. As of August 2022, locations with six or more destination chargers may start charging for electricity. All destination chargers appear in the in car navigation system.  Software updates and upgrades  Tesla vehicles' software is regularly updated over the air when new software and firmware versions are released. This allows the cars to remain up to date and improve after purchase. Tesla also offers the option to unlock features in the car through over the air software upgrades after purchase. Available upgrades include basic Autopilot, Full Self Driving, acceleration boost , and rear heated seats .  Connectivity  All Tesla cars come with Standard Connectivity which provides navigation using a cellular connection, and the following only over Wi Fi or Bluetooth: internet browsing, music streaming , and, when parked, video streaming and caraoke . Premium Connectivity adds cellular access to those features and also provides live traffic and satellite maps for navigation.  Vehicle servicing  Tesla service strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, customers are referred to a local Tesla owned service center, or a mobile technician is dispatched. Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships.In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes, and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters.  Insurance  On June 4, 2017, the American Automobile Association raised insurance rates for Tesla owners following a report from the Highway Loss Data Institute. The report concluded that the Model S crashes 46 more often and is 50 more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. Similarly, the Model X was concluded to crash 41 more often and to be 89 more expensive to repair than similar vehicles. As a result, AAA raised insurance rates on Tesla cars by 30 . Tesla said that the analysis is severely flawed and not reflective of reality , however, Tesla failed to provide any contradictory numbers. Shortly thereafter, Russ Rader, the spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, confirmed the AAA's analysis and that Teslas get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair afterward . The following year, an analysis of claim frequency and insurance cost data by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted by financial research provider 24 7 Wall St. found that the Tesla Model S and Model X were the two most expensive vehicles to insure. Musk stated that he expects these insurance rates will greatly decrease once driver assist and self driving technology become commonplace.Starting in October 2017, Tesla partnered with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company to offer US customers an insurance plan designed specifically for Tesla cars. In August 2019, this partnership was superseded by a partnership with State National Insurance, but was initially only available to Tesla owners in California. In July 2020, Musk, relying on data obtained through the partnership with State National Insurance, announced that Tesla was creating its own major insurance company. Tesla claims the insurance uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing.As of July 2022, Tesla offers insurance in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Virginia.  Business strategy  At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive. In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high price, low volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars. Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low volume and priced at over 100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market, selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer.Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company owned stores. The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers. Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls galleries that the company says educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries. These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high traffic areas, instead of near other auto dealerships. As of January 2022, Tesla does not pay for direct advertisement. Tesla has a high degree of vertical integration, estimated at 80 in 2016. The company produces vehicle components as well as building proprietary stations where customers can charge their vehicles. Vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80 of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly. Tesla used low cost strategy as a business approach, with which they can expand their business into a broader market by offering standard technology items.Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy. Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly. Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and trade secrets to prevent direct copying of its technology.  Technology Tesla develops many components in house, such as batteries, motors, and software.  Vehicle batteries  Tesla was the first automaker to use batteries containing thousands of small, cylindrical, lithium ion commodity cells like those used in consumer electronics. Tesla uses a version of these cells that is designed to be cheaper to manufacture and lighter than standard cells by removing some safety features; according to Tesla, these features are redundant because of the advanced thermal management system and an intumescent chemical in the battery to prevent fires.The batteries are placed under the vehicle floor. This saves interior and trunk space but increases the risk of battery damage by debris or impact . After two vehicle fires in 2013 due to road debris, the Model S was retrofitted with a multi part aluminum and titanium protection system to reduce the possibility of damage.In 2016, former Tesla CTO J.B. Straubel expected batteries to last 10 15 years, and discounted using electric cars to charge the grid with vehicle to grid because the related battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also preferred recycling over re use for grid once they reach the end of their useful life for vehicles. Tesla launched its battery recycling operation at Giga Nevada in 2019.Panasonic is Tesla's supplier of cells in the United States, and cooperates with Tesla in producing cylindrical 2170 batteries at Giga Nevada. As of January 2021, Panasonic has the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of batteries at Giga Nevada. Tesla's battery cells used in Giga Shanghai are supplied by Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology , and are the more traditional prismatic cells used by other automakers.  Battery research  Tesla invests in lithium ion battery research. Starting in 2016, the company established a 5 year battery research and development partnership at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher Jeff Dahn. Tesla acquired two battery companies: Maxwell Technologies, acquired for over 200 million but sold in 2021 and Hibar Systems.During Tesla's Battery Day event on September 22, 2020, Tesla announced the next generation of batteries, featuring a tab less battery design to increase the range and decrease the price of Tesla vehicles. The new battery is named the 4680 in reference to its dimensions: 46 millimetres wide by 80 millimetres tall. Two weeks before Battery Day, Tesla paid a total of 3 to buy several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company.Tesla predicted the new batteries could be up to 56 cheaper and allow the cars to have a 54 longer range. The company said this would be achieved by a more efficient production process, new battery design, cheaper resources for the anode and cathode, and better integration into the vehicle. Business analysis company BloombergNEF estimated Tesla's battery pack price in 2021 at 112 per kWh, versus an industry average of 132 per kWh. As of December 2021, BloombergNEF estimates the industry as a whole will reach 100 per kWh in 2024. The United States Department of Energy estimated in 2020 that with battery prices at 100 per kWh, electric cars would be the same cost to purchase as comparable gasoline powered cars, which would accelerate the sales of electric cars.  Motors  Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a three phase four pole alternating current induction motor with a copper rotor , which is used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X. Newer, higher efficiency permanent magnet motors are used in the Model 3, Model Y, the front motor of 2019 onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi. The permanent magnet motors increase efficiency, especially in stop start driving.  Autopilot  Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system developed by Tesla. The system requires active driver supervision at all times.Since September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors and software to support Autopilot. Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 to support full self driving in the future. HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve ultrasonic sensors, and forward facing radar. HW2.5 was released in mid 2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second graphics processing unit and, for the Model 3 only, a driver facing camera. HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla designed system on a chip.In April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software as a standard feature moving forward. Full self driving software , Auto Lane Change , Summon , Smart Summon and future abilities is an extra cost option.In 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights. In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone. The New York Times reported in December 2021 that Musk repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone, an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as deeply flawed. Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures.  Full Self Driving  Full Self Driving is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully autonomous driving. At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017, which as of July 2022 has not occurred. The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers. The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads. The National Transportation Safety Board has called for tougher requirements for any testing of Autopilot on public roads.Tesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies. Whereas Waymo, Cruise, and other companies are relying on highly detailed three dimensional maps, lidar, and cameras, as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse grained two dimensional maps and cameras as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors. Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self drive without geofencing concerns. Tesla's self driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021. Tesla also designed a self driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019.Most experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self driving by eschewing lidar and high definition maps is not feasible. In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the California Department of Motor Vehicles about FSD's capability acquired by PlainSite via a public records request Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at Society of Automotive Engineers Level 2 automation. In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector. In October 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk.In September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of its proposed humanoid robot Optimus, which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages.  Glass  In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the Tesla Solar Roof's solar shingles.  Facilities  The company operates six large factories. The company also operates showrooms and galleries around the world.  United States  Tesla was founded in San Carlos, California. In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto.Tesla's first retail store was opened in 2008 in Los Angeles, followed by others in major U.S. cities. As of June 2022, Tesla operates 196 stores and galleries in the United States, has stores and galleries in 34 other countries, and has 655 service centers globally.Tesla's first assembly plant occupies the former NUMMI plant in Fremont, California, known as the Tesla Fremont Factory. The factory was originally opened by General Motors in 1962, and then operated by a joint venture of GM and Toyota from 1984. The original factory was closed in 2010, and was acquired by Tesla the same year. The first major battery production facility was opened in Nevada in 2016. Gigafactory Nevada produces Powerwalls, Powerpacks and Megapacks; battery cells in partnership with Panasonic; and Model 3 battery packs and drivetrains. The factory received substantial subsidies from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years.As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla acquired Gigafactory New York located in Buffalo, New York, on the site of a former Republic Steel plant. SolarCity had received incentives to locate its factory in Buffalo through the Buffalo Billion program. In 2017, the factory started production of solar shingles for the Tesla Solar Roof. Between 2017 and 2020 Tesla partnered with Panasonic to assemble photovoltaic modules at the plant. In May 2020, after Alameda County had refused to let the Tesla factory reopen after a COVID 19 lockdown, Elon Musk threatened that he would move the company's headquarters from California to Texas or Nevada.On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of Gigafactory 5, since then known as Gigafactory Texas Giga Texas is planned to be the main factory for the Tesla Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi; it will also produce Model 3 and Model Y cars for the Eastern United States. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the public opening of the Giga Texas facility with its Cyber Rodeo event attended by an estimated 15,000 invitees.On December 1, 2021, Tesla officially relocated its headquarters to the Gigafactory site in Austin, Texas. Because of Texas regulations, the company offers to cover costs for out of state healthcare, which include abortion and gender affirmation procedures.Tesla acquired a former JC Penney distribution center near Lathrop, California in 2021 to build a Megafactory to manufacture Megapacks. The location opened in 2022 and produces the next generation Megapacks to use prismatic lithium iron phosphate batteries.  Europe  Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London. Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands. Tesla operates facilities in Tilburg, including a 62,000 square foot European Distribution Centre and an 835,800 square foot final assembly facility that adds drivetrain, battery and software to imported car bodies to reduce import tax, which depends on the location of final assembly.In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm Grohmann Engineering as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process. After winding down existing contracts with other auto manufacturers, the renamed Tesla Grohmann Automation now works exclusively on Tesla projects.Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016. Several countries campaigned to be the host, and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019. On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named Gigafactory Berlin Brandenburg opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars.  Asia  Tesla opened its first Japanese showroom in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010. By 2013, showrooms and service centers were operating in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. Two showrooms opened in South Korea in March 2017 and a service center opened there in late 2017. In August 2017, Taiwan opened its first service center and showroom.In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States. The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial Tesla Model 3s were in production from Giga Shanghai in October 2019.In response to the Chinese military banning Tesla cars from entering military housing complexes, Elon Musk stated during the China Development Forum in March 2021 that the company would stop producing cars in the country if cars were being used to spy. The comment came shortly after a meeting of Chinese and U.S. diplomats in Alaska, in part over concerns of U.S. intervention in China's internal affairs.In 2021, China accounted for 26 of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45 of its sales.  Rest of the world  Tesla opened the first Australian showroom in Sydney in 2010, followed by a showroom and service center in Melbourne in 2015. By 2019, Tesla had opened 4 service centers in Australia. In 2012, Tesla opened its first store in Canada in Toronto.The first expansion of Tesla in the Middle East was with the opening of a showroom and a service center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates , in 2017. Five ultra fast superchargers were also built between cities in the UAE, with a planned 50 destination chargers by the end of 2017. One of the first Tesla customers was Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority which ordered 200 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles that were added to Dubai Taxi Corporation's fleet. In May 2017, a service center and store in Amman, Jordan was opened. In January 2020 a pop up store in Tel Aviv, Israel was opened as well as a research and development center.  Partners   Panasonic  In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker Panasonic announced that they would together develop nickel based lithium ion battery cells for electric vehicles. The partnership was part of Panasonic's 1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium ion cell research, development and production.Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested 30 million for a multi year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles. In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada.Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York. The partnership started in mid 2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021.In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves.  Other current partners  Tesla has long term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with Piedmont Lithium to buy high purity lithium ore for up to ten years, specifically to supply spodumene concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina mineral deposit . In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate over four years from the Core Lithium's lithium mine in the Northern Territory of Australia.Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with Airbnb and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations.  Former partners   Daimler AG  Daimler AG and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10 in Tesla for a reported 50 million. As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice president of E Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat. On July 13, 2009, Daimler AG sold 40 of its acquisition to Aabar. Aabar is an investment company controlled by the International Petroleum Investment Company , which is owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported 780 million.Tesla supplied battery packs for Freightliner Trucks' Custom Chassis electric van in 2010. The company also built electric powertrain components for the Mercedes Benz A Class E Cell, with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011.Tesla produced and co developed the Mercedes Benz B250e's powertrain, which ended production in 2017. The electric motor was rated 134 hp and 230 pound force feet , with a 36 kWh battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km with a top speed of 150 km h . Daimler division Smart produced the Smart ED2 cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery from Tesla.  Toyota  In May 2010, Tesla and Toyota announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former NUMMI factory from Toyota for 42 million, Toyota purchased 50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle.In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation Toyota RAV4 EV. The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal oxide battery and other powertrain components based on components from the Roadster.The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan . The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014.According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was marred by clashes between engineers . Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris related crashes lead to cars catching fire. On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership.  Mobileye  Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with Mobileye beginning in 2014. Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing disagreements about how the technology was deployed.  Lawsuits and controversies  Tesla has been the subject of many lawsuits, increasing government scrutiny, and public controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products.  Sexual harassment  In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory. They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief, Brooks told The Washington Post. That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job. Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex.Women feared calling HR for help as their supervisors were often participants. Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to T.IT.S , and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment. What we re addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla, said attorney David A. Lowe. In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of a neutral, third party expert and concluded her complaints were unmerited.In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed door arbitration.  Labor disputes  In June 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took issue with Tesla's use of nondisclosure agreements regarding customer repairs and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta. Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees and customers to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage.From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many Occupational Safety and Health Administration violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined. An investigation by the Reveal podcast alleged that Tesla failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports in order to downplay the extent of injuries.In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders. Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen. In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to arbitration. In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an unopposed motion with the court stating Hansen has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing .In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged employee attempts to unionize.In March 2021, the US National Labor Relations Board ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over union organization activities.  Fraud  There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013, Bloomberg News questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles reporting standards. Fortune accused Tesla in 2016 of using creative accounting to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits. In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance. In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of significant fraud , and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist. From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than 295 million in Zero Emission Vehicle credits for a battery swapping technology that was never made available to customers. Staff at California Air Resources Board were concerned that Tesla was gaming the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits.A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose troubling facts essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition. The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant. In April 2022, a Delaware court ruled in favor of defendant Elon Musk in a shareholder lawsuit over Tesla's 2.6 billion acquisition of SolarCity. The Tesla Board meaningfully vetted the Acquisition, and Elon did not stand in its way, read the opinion by Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights. Equally if not more important, the preponderance of the evidence reveals that Tesla paid a fair price SolarCity was, at a minimum, worth what Tesla paid for it, Slights added.On August 7, 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, Am considering taking Tesla private at 420. Funding secured. The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false. Musk settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board. Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of 20 million each. A civil class action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private.In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding its Model 3 production figures. Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet. A stockholder class action lawsuit related to Model 3 production numbers was dismissed in Tesla's favor in March 2019.  Tesla US dealership disputes  Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised auto dealerships to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called galleries which educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles. This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers. The United States Federal Trade Commission ultimately contradicted the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8 in average vehicle price.Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars. The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles, because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a conflict of interest for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales. Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships.  Intellectual property  In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal Dropbox account. Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a willful and malicious thief and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer. The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation.Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions; for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading Tesla Autopilot source code to his iCloud account; Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021.  Defamation  In January 2022, Tesla's China division announced that it is taking legal action against Xiaogang Xuezhang , a Douyin user with over 14 million followers on the platform. The lawsuit arose after Xiaogang posted two videos on Douyin in April 2021, in which he tested the automated emergency braking systems of a Tesla Model 3 and an XPeng P7. In the videos, Xiaogang said the Model 3's AEB system failed to activate two out of three times, leading to collisions. Tesla claims the data was fabricated and tarnishes the brand's reputation among consumers.  Misappropriation  In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock based compensation plan. Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than 700 million in May 2020.  Environmental violations  In 2019, The United States Environmental Protection Agency fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017. In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District; the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019. Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3.In June 2018, Tesla employee Martin Tripp leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40 of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory. After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory. The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020.  Property damage  In August 2019, Walmart filed a multi million dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's negligent installation and maintenance of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012. Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.In May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over the air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner . Approximately 10,000 other Norwegian Tesla owners may be granted a similar award.  Racism  Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination, with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as a hotbed of racist behavior . As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American. A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a very racist place . Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of Juneteenth in 2020 also came under fire. Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and allows a racist environment in its factories. According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial and physically demanding work. The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for discriminating against its Black workers. In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received 1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the n word and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant.In October 2021, a jury verdict in the Owen Diaz vs. Tesla trial awarded the plaintiff 137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015 2016. In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never really a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n word were expressed in a friendly manner. In April 2022, federal judge William Orrick upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to 15 million. Diaz was given a two week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the 15 million award, opening the door for a new trial.Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements. Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.  Conduct during the COVID 19 pandemic  Tesla's initial response to the COVID 19 pandemic in the United States has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay at home orders. In an earnings call in April, he was heard calling the public health orders fascist . He had also called the public's response to the pandemic dumb and had said online that there would be zero cases by April. In May 2020, while Alameda County officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the Fremont Factory on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th. Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen. Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe, however some employees continued to express concern for their health.In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work. But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory. Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID 19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll. COVID 19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant .In China, Tesla had what one Tesla executive described as not a green light from the government to get back to work but a flashing sirens police escort. Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its Giga Shanghai factory at breakneck speeds. Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating U.S. Chinese relations, China's ongoing persecution of Uyghurs, and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong.  Criticism   Delays  Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products. By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections. In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December. A month later, he revised that target to sometime in March 2018. Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well. Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be solar powered have also lagged projections. Musk responded in late 2018: punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?  Giga New York audit  In 2020, the New York State Comptroller released an audit of the Giga New York factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only 0.54 in economic benefits for every 1 spent by the state.  Tesla's mission  According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims.  Short sellers and TSLAQ  TSLAQ is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to shape the perception of Tesla and move its stock. In January 2020, 20 of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets. By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost 40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher. Michael Burry, a short seller portrayed in The Big Short, had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021.  Vehicle product issues   Recalls  On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and prevent the vehicles from moving . On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to corrosion susceptible power steering bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use increased force to control the vehicle.In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues. Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding front suspension safety issues , citing specifically 2015 2017 Model S and 2016 2017 Model X years. Cases of the whompy wheel phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020.In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a flash memory device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years. The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features. The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of syslog content to the device, wearing it out prematurely.Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of body mouldings problems .In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash.On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1 of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear view camera, and around 14 of recalled model S's may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion. After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving.In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury. In response, Tesla announced an over the air software fix.  Fires and Autopilot crashes  In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in Kent, Washington. Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object. As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage. In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs. All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25 inch aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three layer shield. In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause non crash fires.A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot. The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety related defect trend. In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway.According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some involving fatalities. In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot in order to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first responder vehicles. In late September 2021, Tesla released an over the air software update to detect emergency lights at night. In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it didn't issue a recall when it sent out that update. In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the Preliminary Evaluation level to the Engineering Analysis one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision. A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self Driving repeatedly hit a child sized mannequin in its path, but there has been controversy over its conclusions. Several Tesla fans responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice.  Software hacking  In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system. The hack required the researchers to physically access the car. Tesla issued a security update for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced.In September 2016, researchers at Tencent's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi Fi hotspot. This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their bug bounty program and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public. Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017.In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an Amazon Web Services account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for cryptocurrency mining. Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security. Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and 375,000 to ethical hackers during a Pwn2Own Model 3 hacking event.In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with NFC cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle.  Phantom braking  Tesla drivers have reported a surge in phantom braking events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor. In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation.  Vehicle sales In 2021, Tesla ranked as the world's bestselling plug in and battery electric passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 14 of the plug in segment and 21 of the battery electric segment sales. Tesla reported 2021 vehicle deliveries of 936,222 units, up 87 from 2020. At the end of 2021, Tesla's global sales since 2012 totaled 2.3 million units.  Production and sales by quarter  Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of car carriers and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone. In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone.  Finances  For the fiscal year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of 5.52 billion. The annual revenue was 53.8 billion, an increase of 71 over the previous fiscal year.Of the revenue number in 2021, 314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters. In Q1 2022, Tesla sold 679 million of regulatory carbon credits.Tesla ended 2021 with 17.6 billion of cash on hand, down 1.8 billion from the end of 2020.: 31 In February 2021, a 10 K filing revealed that Tesla had invested some 1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals. Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced.The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits.  Senior leadership   List of chief executives  Martin Eberhard Ze'ev Drori Elon Musk   List of board chairs  Elon Musk Robyn Denholm   Board of directors  In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the California State Teachers' Retirement System, asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk . The investors wrote that five of six current non executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement. Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity; Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX; Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX. The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on groupthink. At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors should buy Ford stock because their governance is amazing. Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members; Kathleen Wilson Thompson and Larry Ellison were added at the end of 2018. Ellison stepped down in August 2022.Other previous board members include businessman Steve Westly; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler; and CEO and Chairman of Johnson Publishing Company Linda Johnson Rice.As of September 2022, the Board members are:  See also List of automobile manufacturers of the United States List of Easter eggs in Tesla products List of production battery electric vehicles Plug in electric vehicles in California Plug in electric vehicles in the United States  Notes Footnotes  References   Further reading Higgins, Tim .

            "text": "The Tesla turbine is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913. It is referred to as a bladeless turbine. The Tesla turbine is also known as the boundary layer turbine, cohesion type turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine because it uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine. Bioengineering researchers have referred to it as a multiple disk centrifugal pump.One of Tesla's desires for implementation of this turbine was for geothermal power, which was described in Our Future Motive Power.  Theory  In the pump, the radial or static pressure, due to centrifugal force, is added to the tangential or dynamic , thus increasing the effective head and assisting in the expulsion of the fluid. In the motor, on the contrary, the first named pressure, being opposed to that of the supply, reduces the effective head and the velocity of radial flow towards the center. Again, the propelled machine a great torque is always desirable, this calling for an increased number of disks and smaller distance of separation, while in the propelling machine, for numerous economic reasons, the rotary effort should be the smallest and the speed the greatest practicable. In standard steam turbines, the steam has to press on the blades for the rotor to extract energy from the speed of the steam, due to the difference between the relative speed of the steam and the blades. In the bladed steam turbine, the blades must be carefully oriented, in the optimal speed regime of the turbine's work, in such a way as to minimize the angle of the steam attack to the blade surface area. In their words, in the optimal regime, the orientation of the blades is trying to minimize the angle with which the steam is hitting their surface area, as to create smooth steam flow, to try to minimize turbulence. These eddies are created in reaction to the steam impacting the surface of the blades. In this dynamic, the first eddies a loss of the useful energy that can be extracted from the system, and second, as they are in opposite directions, they subtract from the energy of the incoming steam flow.In the Tesla turbine, considering that there are no blades to be impacted, the mechanics of the reaction forces are different. The reaction force, to the steam head pressure, actually builds, relatively quickly, as a steam pressure belt along the periphery of the turbine. That belt is most dense, and pressurized, in the periphery as its pressure, when the rotor is not under load, will be not much less than the steam pressure. In a normal operational mode, that peripheral pressure, as Tesla noted, plays a role of BEMF , limiting the flow of the incoming stream, and in this way, the Tesla turbine can be said to be self governing. When the rotor is not under load the relative speeds between the steam compressed spirals and the disks are minimal.When a load is applied on the Tesla turbine shaft slows down, i.e., the relative speed of the discs to the fluid increases as the fluid, at least initially, preserves its angular momentum. For example, in a 10 cm radius where at 9000 RPM the peripheral disk speeds are 90 m s , when there is no load on the rotor, the disks move at approximately the same speed as the fluid, but when the rotor is loaded, the relative velocity differential increases and 45 m s rotor speed has a relative speed of 45 m s to the SCS. This is a dynamic environment, and these speeds reach these values over time delta and not instantly. Here we have to note that fluids start to behave like solid bodies at high relative velocities, and in the TT case, we also have to take into consideration the additional pressure. According to the old literature on steam boilers, it is said that steam at high speed, resulting from a high pressure source, cuts steel as a knife cuts butter . According to the logic, this pressure and relative velocity toward the faces of the discs, the steam should start behaving like a solid body dragging on disk metal surfaces. The created friction can only lead to the generation of additional heat directly on the disk and in SCS and will be most pronounced in the peripheral layer, where the relative velocity between the metal discs and SCS discs is the highest. This increase in the temperature, due to the friction between the SCS disks and the turbine disks, will be translated to an increase in the SCS temperature, and that will lead to SCS steam expansion and pressure increase perpendicular to the metal discs as well as radially on the axis of rotation , and so this fluid dynamic model appears to be positive feedback for transmitting a stronger dragging on the metal disks and consequently increasing the torque at the axis of rotation.  Design  The guiding idea for developing the Tesla turbine is the fact that to attain the highest efficiency, the changes in the velocity and direction of movement of fluid should be as gradual as possible. Therefore, the propelling fluid of the Tesla turbine moves in natural paths or streamlines of the least resistance. A Tesla turbine consists of a set of smooth disks, with nozzles applying a moving fluid to the edge of the disk. The fluid drags on the disk through viscosity and the adhesion of the surface layer of the fluid. As the fluid slows and adds energy to the disks, it spirals into the Centre exhaust. Since the rotor has no projections, it is very sturdy. Tesla wrote: This turbine is an efficient self starting prime mover which may be operated as a steam or mixed fluid turbine at will, without changes in construction and is on this account very convenient. Minor departures from the turbine, as may be dictated by the circumstances in each case, will suggest themselves but if it is carried out on these general lines it will be found highly profitable to the owners of the steam plant while permitting the use of their old installation. However, the best economic results in the development of power from steam by the Tesla turbine will be obtained in plants especially adapted for the purpose. Smooth rotor disks were originally proposed, but these gave poor starting torque. Tesla subsequently discovered that smooth rotor disks with small washers bridging the disks in about 12 to 24 places around the perimeter of a 10 disk and a second ring of 6 12 washers at a sub diameter made for a significant improvement in starting torque without compromising efficiency.  Efficiency and calculations  In Tesla's time, the efficiency of conventional turbines was low because turbines used a direct drive system that severely limited the potential speed of a turbine to whatever it was driving. At the time of introduction, modern ship turbines were massive and included dozens, or even hundreds of stages of turbines, yet produced extremely low efficiency due to their low speed. For example, the turbine on Olympic and Titanic weighed over 400 tons, ran at just 165 rpm, and used steam at a pressure of only 6 psi. This limited it to harvesting waste steam from the main power plants, a pair of reciprocating steam engines. The Tesla turbine also could run on higher temperature gasses than bladed turbines of the time, which contributed to its greater efficiency. Eventually, axial turbines were given gearing to allow them to operate at higher speeds, but the efficiency of axial turbines remained very low in comparison to the Tesla turbine. As time went on, competing for axial turbines became dramatically more efficient and powerful, and the second stage of reduction gears was introduced in most cutting edge U.S. naval ships of the 1930s. The improvement in steam technology gave the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers a clear advantage in speed over both Allied and enemy aircraft carriers, and so the proven axial steam turbines became the preferred form of propulsion until the 1973 oil crisis took place. It drove the majority of new civilian vessels to turn to diesel engines. Axial steam turbines still had not exceeded 50 efficiency by that time, and so civilian ships chose to use diesel engines due to their superior efficiency. By this time, the comparably efficient Tesla turbine was over 60 years old. Tesla's design attempted to sidestep the key drawbacks of the bladed axial turbines, and even the lowest estimates for efficiency still dramatically outperformed the efficiency of axial steam turbines of the day. However, in testing against more modern engines, the Tesla turbine had expansion efficiencies far below contemporary steam turbines and far below contemporary reciprocating steam engines. It does suffer from other problems, such as shear losses and flows restrictions, but this is partially offset by the relatively massive reduction in weight and volume. Some of Tesla's turbine advantages lie in relatively low flow rate applications or when small applications are called for. The disks need to be as thin as possible at the edges in order not to introduce turbulence as the fluid leaves the disks. This translates to needing to increase the number of disks as the flow rate increases. Maximum efficiency comes in this system when the inter disk spacing approximates the thickness of the boundary layer, and since boundary layer thickness is dependent on viscosity and pressure, the claim that a single design can be used efficiently for a variety of fuels and fluids is incorrect. A Tesla turbine differs from a conventional turbine only in the mechanism used for transferring energy to the shaft. Various analyses demonstrate that the flow rate between the disks must be kept relatively low to maintain efficiency. Reportedly, the efficiency of the Tesla turbine drops with increased load. Under light load, the spiral taken by the fluid moving from the intake to the exhaust is a tight spiral, undergoing many rotations. Under load, the number of rotations drops, and the spiral becomes progressively shorter. This will increase the shear losses and also reduce the efficiency because the gas is in contact with the discs for less distance. The turbine efficiency of the gas Tesla turbine is estimated to be above 60 . The turbine efficiency is different from the cycle efficiency of the engine using the turbine. Axial turbines that operate today in steam plants or jet engines have efficiencies of over 90 . This is different from the cycle efficiencies of the plant or engine, which are between approximately 25 and 42 , and are limited by any irreversibility to be below the Carnot cycle efficiency. Tesla claimed that a steam version of his device would achieve around 95 efficiency. The thermodynamic efficiency is a measure of how well it performs compared to an isentropic case. It is the ratio of the ideal to the actual work input output. In the 1950s, Warren Rice attempted to recreate Tesla's experiments, but he did not perform these early tests on a pump built strictly in line with Tesla's patented design . Rice's experimental single stage system's working fluid was air. Rice's test turbines, as published in early reports, produced an overall measured efficiency of 36 41 for a single stage. Higher efficiency would be expected if designed as originally proposed by Tesla. In his final work with the Tesla turbine and published just before his retirement, Rice conducted a bulk parameter analysis of model laminar flow in multiple disk turbines. A very high claim for rotor efficiency for this design was published in 1991 titled Tesla Turbomachinery . This paper states: With proper use of the analytical results, the rotor efficiency using laminar flow can be very high, even above 95 . However, in order to attain high rotor efficiency, the flowrate number must be made small which means high rotor efficiency is achieved at the expense of using a large number of disks and hence a physically larger rotor. For each value of flow rate number there is an optimum value of Reynolds number for maximum efficiency. With common fluids, the required disk spacing is dismally small causing rotors using laminar flow to tend to be large and heavy for a prescribed throughflow rate. Extensive investigations have been made of Tesla type liquid pumps using laminar flow rotors. It was found that overall pump efficiency was low even when rotor efficiency was high because of the losses occurring at the rotor entrance and exit earlier mentioned. Modern multiple stage bladed turbines typically reach 60 70 efficiency, while large steam turbines often show turbine efficiency of over 90 in practice. Volute rotor matched Tesla type machines of reasonable size with common fluids would also be expected to show efficiencies in the vicinity of 60 70 and possibly higher.  Applications  Tesla's patents state that the device was intended for the use of fluids as motive agents, as distinguished from the propulsion or compression of fluids . As of 2016, the Tesla turbine has not seen widespread commercial use. The Tesla pump, however, has been commercially available since 1982 and is used to pump fluids that are abrasive, viscous, shear sensitive, contain solids, or are otherwise difficult to handle with other pumps. Tesla himself did not procure a large contract for production. The main disadvantage was poor knowledge of materials characteristics and behaviors at high temperatures. The best metallurgy of the day could not prevent the turbine disks from moving and warping unacceptably during operation. Many amateur experiments have been conducted using Tesla turbines with compressed air, or steam as the power source . Disc warping has been ameliorated by using new materials such as carbon fiber. One proposed application for the device is a waste pump, in factories and mills where normal vane type turbine pumps typically become fouled. Applications of the Tesla turbine as a multiple disk centrifugal blood pump have yielded promising results due to the low peak shear force.Biomedical engineering research on such applications has continued into the 21st century.The device functions as a pump if a similar set of disks and a housing with an involute shape are used. In this configuration, a motor is attached to the shaft. The fluid enters near the center, is energized by the disks, then exits at the periphery. The Tesla turbine does not use friction in the conventional sense; precisely, it avoids it and uses adhesion and viscosity instead. It uses the boundary layer effect on the disc blades.

            "text": "Serbian epic poetry is a form of epic poetry created by Serbs originating in today's Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia. The main cycles were composed by unknown Serb authors between the 14th and 19th centuries. They are largely concerned with historical events and personages. The instrument accompanying the epic poetry is the gusle. Serbian epic poetry helped in developing the Serbian national consciousness. The cycles of Prince Marko, the Hajduks and Uskoks inspired the Serbs to restore freedom and their heroic past. The Hajduks in particular, are seen as an integral part of national identity; in stories, the hajduks were heroes: they had played the role of the Serbian elite during Ottoman rule, they had defended the Serbs against Ottoman oppression, and prepared for the national liberation and contributed to it in the Serbian Revolution.  History The earliest surviving record of an epic poem related to Serbian epic poetry is a ten verse fragment of a bugar tica song from 1497 in Southern Italy about the imprisonment of Sibinjanin Janko by ura Brankovi , however the regional origin and ethnic identity of its Slavic performers remains a matter of scholarly dispute. From at least the Ottoman period up until the present day, Serbian epic poetry was sung accompanied by the gusle and there are historical references to Serb performers playing the gusle at the Polish Lithuanian royal courts in the 16th and 17th centuries, and later on in Ukraine and Hungary. Hungarian historian Sebesty n Tin di wrote in 1554 that there are many gusle players here in Hungary, but none is better at the Serbian style than Dimitrije Karaman , and described Karaman's performance to Turkish lord Uluman in 1551 in Lipova: the guslar would hold the gusle between his knees and go into a highly emotional artistic performance with a sad and dedicated expression on his face. Chronicler and poet Maciej Stryjkowski included a verse mentions the Serbs singing heroic songs about ancestors fighting the Turks in his 1582 chronicle. J zef Bart omiej Zimorowic used the phrase to sing to the Serbian gusle in his 1663 idyll piewacy .In 1824, Vuk Karad i sent a copy of his folksong collection to Jacob Grimm, who was particularly enthralled by The Building of Skadar. Grimm translated it into German, and described it as one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times .Many of the epics are about the era of the Ottoman occupation of Serbia and the struggle for the liberation. With the efforts of ethnographer Vuk Karad i , many of these epics and folk tales were collected and published in books in the first half of the 19th century. Up until that time, these poems and songs had been almost exclusively an oral tradition, transmitted by bards and singers. Among the books Karad i published were: A Small Simple Folk Slavonic Serbian Songbook, 1814; Serbian Folk Song Book Serbian Folk Tales Serbian Folk Proverbs and Other Common Expressions, 1834. Women's Songs from Herzegovina  which was collected by Karad i 's collaborator and assistant Vuk Vr evi These editions appeared in Europe when romanticism was in full bloom and there was much interest in Serbian folk poetry, including from Johann Gottfried Herder, Jacob Grimm, Goethe and Jernej Kopitar.  Gusle  The gusle instrumentally accompanies heroic songs in the Balkans. The instrument is held vertically between the knees, with the left hand fingers on the neck. The strings are never pressed to the neck, giving a harmonic and unique sound. There is no consensus about the origin of the instrument, while some researchers believe it was brought with the Slavs to the Balkans, based on a 6th century Byzantine source. Teodosije the Hilandarian wrote that Stefan Nemanji often entertained the Serbian nobility with musicians with drums and gusle . Reliable written records about the gusle appear only in the 15th century. 16th century travel memoirs mention the instrument in Bosnia and Serbia.It is known that Serbs sang to the gusle during the Ottoman period. Notable Serbian performers played at the Polish royal courts in the 16th and 17th centuries, and later on in Ukraine and in Hungary. There is an old mention in Serbo Croatian literature that a Serbian guslar was present at the court of W adys aw II Jagie o in 1415. In a poem published in 1612, Kasper Miaskowski wrote that the Serbian gusle and gaidas will overwhelm Shrove Tuesday . J zef Bart omiej Zimorowic used the phrase to sing to the Serbian gusle in his 1663 idyll piewacy .  Corpus The corpus of Serbian epic poetry is divided into cycles: Non historic cycle  poems about Slavic mythology, characteristically about dragons and nymphs Cycle of Nemanji Pre Kosovo cycle  poems about events that predate the Battle of Kosovo Kosovo cycle  poems about events that happened just before and after the Battle of Kosovo Post Kosovo cycle  poems about post Battle events Cycle of Kraljevi Marko Cycle of Brankovi Cycle of Crnojevi Cycle of hajduks and uskoks  poems about brigands and rebels Poems about the liberation of Serbia and Montenegro  poems about the 19th century battles against the OttomansPoems depict historical events with varying degrees of accuracy.

I am feeling with my wing torn outLike a brother one without the other. Modern example of Serbian epics as recorded in 1992 by film director Pawe Pawlikowski in a documentary for the BBC Serbian epics; an anonymous gusle singer compares Radovan Karad i , as he prepares to depart for Geneva for peace talk, to Kara or e, who had led the First Serbian Uprising against the Turks in 1804: Hey, Radovan, you man of steel!The greatest leader since Kara or e!Defend our freedom and our faith,On the shores of Lake Geneva.  Quotes The ballads of Serbia occupy a high position, perhaps the highest position, in the ballad literature of Europe. They would, if well known, astonish Europe... In them breathes a clear and inborn poetry such as can scarcely be found among any other modern people. Jacob Grimm Everyone in the West who has known these poems has proclaimed them to be literature of the highest order which ought to be known better. Charles Simic  Modern Serbian epic poetry Epic poetry is recorded still today. Some modern songs are published in books or recorded, and under copyright, but some are in public domain, and modified by subsequent authors just like old ones. There are new songs that mimic old epic poetry, but are humorous and not epic in nature; these are also circulating around with no known author. In the latter half of the 19th century, a certain MP would exit the Serbian parliament each day, and tell of the debate over the monetary reform bill in the style of epic poetry. Modern epic heroes include: Radovan Karad i , Ratko Mladi and Vojislav e elj. Topics include: Yugoslav wars, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, and the Hague Tribunal. Popular modern Serbian epic performers, guslari include: Milomir Miljan Miljani , oko Koprivica, Bo ko Vuja i , Vlastimir Bara , Sava Stani i , Milo egrt, Sa a Laketi and Milan Mrdovi .

            "text": "A Tesla valve, called a valvular conduit by its inventor, is a fixed geometry passive check valve. It allows a fluid to flow preferentially in one direction, without moving parts. The device is named after Nikola Tesla, who was awarded U.S. Patent 1,329,559 in 1920 for its invention. The patent application describes the invention as follows: The interior of the conduit is provided with enlargements, recesses, projections, baffles, or buckets which, while offering virtually no resistance to the passage of the fluid in one direction, other than surface friction, constitute an almost impassable barrier to its flow in the opposite direction. Tesla illustrated this with the drawing, showing one possible construction with a series of eleven flow control segments, although any other number of such segments could be used as desired to increase or decrease the flow regulation effect. With no moving parts, Tesla valves are much more resistant to wear and fatigue, especially in applications with frequent pressure reversal such as a pulsejet. The Tesla valve is used in microfluidic applications and offers advantages such as scalability, durability, and ease of fabrication in a variety of materials. It is also used in macrofluidic applications. One computational fluid dynamics simulation of Tesla valves with two and four segments showed that the flow resistance in the blocking direction was about 15 and 40 times greater, respectively, than the unimpeded direction. This lends support to Tesla's patent assertion that in the valvular conduit in his diagram, a pressure ratio approximating 200 can be obtained so that the device acts as a slightly leaking valve .Steady flow experiments, including with the original design, however, show smaller ratios of the two resistances in the range of 2 to 4. It has also been shown that the device works better with pulsatile flows.  Diodicity The valves are structures that have a higher pressure drop for the flow in one direction than the other . This difference in flow resistance causes a net directional flow rate in the forward direction in oscillating flows. The efficiency is often expressed in diodicity         D   i       displaystyle mathrm Di  , being the ratio of directional resistances. The flow resistance is defined, analogously to Ohm's law for electrical resistance, as the ratio of applied pressure drop and resulted flow rate:       R                   p       Q          displaystyle R frac Delta p Q  where         p     displaystyle Delta p  is the applied pressure difference between two ends of the conduit, and       Q     displaystyle Q  the flow rate. The diodicity is then the ratio of the reversed flow resistance to the forward flow resistance:         D   i                 R             r                   R             f                     displaystyle mathrm Di  frac R rm r R rm f  . If         D   i       1     displaystyle mathrm Di 1 , the conduit in question has diodic behavior. Thus diodicity is also the ratio of pressure drops for identical flow rates:         D   i                      Q        ,     displaystyle mathrm Di left Q , where            p          r             displaystyle Delta p rm r  is the reverse flow pressure drop, and            p          f             displaystyle Delta p rm f  the forward flow pressure drop for flow rate       Q     displaystyle Q . Equivalently, diodicity could also be defined as ratio of dimensionless Hagen number or Darcy friction factor at the same Reynolds number.

            "text": "The early history of radio is the history of technology that produces and uses radio instruments that use radio waves. Within the timeline of radio, many people contributed theory and inventions in what became radio. Radio development began as wireless telegraphy . Later radio history increasingly involves matters of broadcasting.  Summary   Invention  The idea of wireless communication predates the discovery of radio with experiments in wireless telegraphy via inductive and capacitive induction and transmission through the ground, water, and even train tracks from the 1830s on. James Clerk Maxwell showed in theoretical and mathematical form in 1864 that electromagnetic waves could propagate through free space. In 1888 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was able to conclusively prove transmitted airborne electromagnetic waves in an experiment confirming Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. After the discovery of these Hertzian waves many scientists and inventors experimented with transmitting and detecting Hertzian waves. Maxwell's theory showing that light and Hertzian electromagnetic waves were the same phenomenon at different wavelengths led Maxwellian scientists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and Alexander Trotter to assume they would be analogous to optical light. The Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla considered Hertzian waves relatively useless for his system since light could not transmit further than line of sight. In 1892 the physicist William Crookes wrote on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves. Others, such as Sir Oliver Lodge, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, and Alexander Popov were involved in the development of components and theory involved with the transmission and reception of airborne electromagnetic waves for their own theoretical work. Over several years starting in 1894 the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi built the first engineering complete, commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based on airborne Hertzian waves . Marconi demonstrated the application of radio in military and marine communications and started a company for the development and propagation of radio communication services and equipment.  19th century  The meaning and usage of the word radio has developed in parallel with developments within the field of communications and can be seen to have three distinct phases: electromagnetic waves and experimentation; wireless communication and technical development; and radio broadcasting and commercialization. In an 1864 presentation, published in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed theories of electromagnetism, with mathematical proofs, that showed that light and predicted that radio and x rays were all types of electromagnetic waves propagating through free space. In 1886 88 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz conducted a series of experiments that proved the existence of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves, using a frequency in what would later be called the radio spectrum. Many individuals inventors, engineers, developers and businessmen constructed systems based on their own understanding of these and other phenomena, some predating Maxwell and Hertz's discoveries. Thus wireless telegraphy and radio wave based systems can be attributed to multiple inventors . Development from a laboratory demonstration to a commercial entity spanned several decades and required the efforts of many practitioners. In 1878, David E. Hughes noticed that sparks could be heard in a telephone receiver when experimenting with his carbon microphone. He developed this carbon based detector further and eventually could detect signals over a few hundred yards. He demonstrated his discovery to the Royal Society in 1880, but was told it was merely induction, and therefore abandoned further research. Thomas Edison came across the electromagnetic phenomenon while experimenting with a telegraph at Menlo Park. He noted an unexplained transmission effect while experimenting with a telegraph. He referred to this as etheric force in an announcement on November 28, 1875. Elihu Thomson published his findings on Edison's new force , again attributing it to induction, an explanation that Edison accepted. Edison would go on the next year to take out U.S. Patent 465,971 on a system of electrical wireless communication between ships based on electrostatic coupling using the water and elevated terminals. Although this was not a radio system, Edison would sell his patent rights to his friend Guglielmo Marconi at the Marconi Company in 1903, rather than another interested party who might end up working against Marconi's interests.  Hertzian waves  Between 1886 and 1888 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of his experiments wherein he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves through the air, proving Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Thus, given Hertz comprehensive discoveries, radio waves were referred to as Hertzian waves . Between 1890 and 1892 physicists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and William Crookes proposed electromagnetic or Hertzian waves as a navigation aid or means of communication, with Crookes writing on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves in 1892.In a lecture on the work of Hertz, shortly after his death, Professors Oliver Lodge and Alexander Muirhead presented a widely covered lecture on Hertzian waves in the lecture theater of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History on August 14, 1894. Lodge focused on the optical qualities of the waves and demonstrated how to transmit, reflect, and detect them . During part of the demonstration radio waves were sent from the neighboring Clarendon Laboratory building, and received by apparatus in the lecture theater.Building on the work of Lodge, the Bengali Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose further explored the optical nature these waves. He conducted his experiments using very short wavelengths which allowed his test equipment, antennas, reflectors, and prisms, to be much smaller. He published the paper On polarisation of electric rays by double refracting crystals in May 1895 followed by a second paper sent to the Royal Society of London in October 1895. The London journal The Electrician noted: Should Professor Bose succeed in perfecting and patenting his Coherer , we may in time see the whole system of coast lighting throughout the navigable world revolutionised by an Indian Bengali scientist working single handed ly in our Presidency College Laboratory. Bose would latter write an essay, Adrisya Alok on how during 1895 he conducted a public demonstration at the Town Hall of Kolkata, India using millimeter range wavelength microwaves to trigger detectors that ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance.In 1895, conducting experiments along the lines of Hertz's research, Alexander Stepanovich Popov built his first radio receiver, which contained a coherer. Popov further refined his invention as a lightning detector and presented to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society on May 7, 1895. A depiction of the lightning detector was printed in the Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society the same year . An earlier description of the device was given by Dmitry Aleksandrovich Lachinov in July 1895 in the second edition of his course Fundamentals of Meteorology and Climatology , which was the first such course in Russia. Popov's receiver was created on the improved basis of Lodge's receiver, and originally intended for reproduction of its experiments.  Guglielmo Marconi  In 1894, the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building long distance wireless transmission systems based on the use of Hertzian waves , a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing. Marconi read through the literature and used the ideas of others who were experimenting with radio waves but did a great deal to develop devices such as portable transmitters and receiver systems that could work over long distances, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system. By August 1895, Marconi was field testing his system but even with improvements he was only able to transmit signals up to one half mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves. Marconi raised the height of his antenna and hit upon the idea of grounding his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements the system was capable of transmitting signals up to 2 miles and over hills. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering complete, commercially successful radio transmission system. Marconi's apparatus is also credited with saving the 700 people who survived the tragic Titanic disaster.In 1896, Marconi was awarded British patent 12039, Improvements in transmitting electrical impulses and signals and in apparatus there for, the first patent ever issued for a Hertzian wave base wireless telegraphic system. In 1897, he established a radio station on the Isle of Wight, England. Marconi opened his wireless factory in the former silk works at Hall Street, Chelmsford, England, in 1898, employing around 60 people. Shortly after the 1900s, Marconi held the patent rights for radio. Marconi would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 and be more successful than any other inventor in his ability to commercialize radio and its associated equipment into a global business. In the US some of his subsequent patented refinements would be overturned in a 1935 court case .  20th century  Through the end of the 19th century Canadian American inventor Reginald Fessenden worked on the possibility of making audio radio transmissions, in contrast to the early spark gap transmissions that could only transmit Morse code messages. To this end he worked on developing a high speed alternator that generated pure sine waves and produced a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength , or, in modern terminology, a continuous wave transmitter. While working for the United States Weather Bureau on Cobb Island, Maryland, Fessenden began research on audio transmissions via radio. Because he did not yet have a continuous wave transmitter, initially he worked with an experimental high frequency spark transmitter, taking advantage of the fact that the higher the spark rate, the closer a spark gap transmission comes to producing continuous waves. He later reported that, in the fall of 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers , which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. Although successful, the sound transmitted was far too distorted to be commercially practical. On Christmas Eve 1906, Fessenden used a synchronous rotary spark transmitter for the first radio program broadcast, from Ocean Bluff Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing O Holy Night on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible. This was, for all intents and purposes, the first transmission of what is now known as amplitude modulation or AM radio. In June 1912 Marconi opened the world's first purpose built radio factory at New Street Works in Chelmsford, England. The first radio news program was broadcast August 31, 1920 by station 8MK in Detroit, Michigan, which survives today as all news format station WWJ under ownership of the CBS network. The first college radio station began broadcasting on October 14, 1920, from Union College, Schenectady, New York under the personal call letters of Wendell King, an African American student at the school.That month 2ADD , aired what is believed to be the first public entertainment broadcast in the United States, a series of Thursday night concerts initially heard within a 100 mile radius and later for a 1,000 mile radius. In November 1920, it aired the first broadcast of a sporting event. At 9 pm on August 27, 1920, Sociedad Radio Argentina aired a live performance of Richard Wagner's opera Parsifal from the Coliseo Theater in downtown Buenos Aires. Only about twenty homes in the city had receivers to tune in this radio program. Meanwhile, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced in 1922 from the Marconi Research Centre at Writtle, England. Sports broadcasting began at this time as well, including the college football on radio broadcast of a 1921 West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh football game.One of the first developments in the early 20th century was that aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation. This continued until the early 1960s when VOR systems became widespread. In the early 1930s, single sideband and frequency modulation were invented by amateur radio operators. By the end of the decade, they were established commercial modes. Radio was used to transmit pictures visible as television as early as the 1920s. Commercial television transmissions started in North America and Europe in the 1940s. In 1947 AT T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis in 1946, AT T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time. Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing US 15 per month, plus 0.30 0.40 per local call, equivalent to about 176 per month and 3.50 4.75 per call. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs, was introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America through the 1980s and into the 2000s. Following development of transistor technology, bipolar junction transistors led to the development of the transistor radio. In 1954, the Regency company introduced a pocket transistor radio, the TR 1, powered by a standard 22.5 V Battery. In 1955, the newly formed Sony company introduced its first transistorized radio, the TR 55. It was small enough to fit in a vest pocket, powered by a small battery. It was durable, because it had no vacuum tubes to burn out. In 1957, Sony introduced the TR 63, the first mass produced transistor radio, leading to the mass market penetration of transistor radios. Over the next 20 years, transistors replaced tubes almost completely except for high power transmitters. By the mid 1960s, the Radio Corporation of America were using metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in their consumer products, including FM radio, television and amplifiers. Metal oxide semiconductor large scale integration provided a practical and economic solution for radio technology, and was used in mobile radio systems by the early 1970s.By 1963, color television was being broadcast commercially , and the first communication satellite, Telstar, was launched. In the 1970s, LORAN became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the U.S. Navy experimented with satellite navigation, culminating in the launch of the Global Positioning System constellation in 1987.  Wavelength vs. frequency  In early radio, and to a limited extent much later, the transmission signal of the radio station was specified in meters, referring to the wavelength, the length of the radio wave. This is the origin of the terms long wave, medium wave, and short wave radio. Portions of the radio spectrum reserved for specific purposes were often referred to by wavelength: the 40 meter band, used for amateur radio, for example. The relation between wavelength and frequency is reciprocal: the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave, and vice versa. As equipment progressed, precise frequency control became possible; early stations often did not have a precise frequency, as it was affected by the temperature of the equipment, among other factors. Identifying a radio signal by its frequency rather than its length proved much more practical and useful, and starting in the 1920s this became the usual method of identifying a signal, especially in the United States. Frequencies specified in number of cycles per second were replaced by the more specific designation of hertz about 1965.  Start of the 20th century Around the start of the 20th century, the Slaby Arco wireless system was developed by Adolf Slaby and Georg von Arco. In 1900, Reginald Fessenden made a weak transmission of voice over the airwaves. In 1901, Marconi conducted the first successful transatlantic experimental radio communications. In 1907, Marconi established the first commercial transatlantic radio communications service, between Clifden, Ireland and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.  Julio Cervera Baviera  Julio Cervera Baviera developed radio in Spain around 1902. Cervera Baviera obtained patents in England, Germany, Belgium, and Spain. In May June 1899, Cervera had, with the blessing of the Spanish Army, visited Marconi's radiotelegraphic installations on the English Channel, and worked to develop his own system. He began collaborating with Marconi on resolving the problem of a wireless communication system, obtaining some patents by the end of 1899. Cervera, who had worked with Marconi and his assistant George Kemp in 1899, resolved the difficulties of wireless telegraph and obtained his first patents prior to the end of that year. On March 22, 1902, Cervera founded the Spanish Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and brought to his corporation the patents he had obtained in Spain, Belgium, Germany and England. He established the second and third regular radiotelegraph service in the history of the world in 1901 and 1902 by maintaining regular transmissions between Tarifa and Ceuta for three consecutive months, and between Javea and Ibiza . This is after Marconi established the radiotelegraphic service between the Isle of Wight and Bournemouth in 1898. In 1906, Domenico Mazzotto wrote: In Spain the Minister of War has applied the system perfected by the commander of military engineering, Julio Cervera Baviera . Cervera thus achieved some success in this field, but his radiotelegraphic activities ceased suddenly, the reasons for which are unclear to this day.  British Marconi  Using various patents, the British Marconi company was established in 1897 by Guglielmo Marconi and began communication between coast radio stations and ships at sea. A year after, in 1898, they successfully introduced their first radio station in Chelmsford. This company, along with its subsidiaries Canadian Marconi and American Marconi, had a stranglehold on ship to shore communication. It operated much the way American Telephone and Telegraph operated until 1983, owning all of its equipment and refusing to communicate with non Marconi equipped ships. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with uses of radio, thus planting the first seeds of broadcasting.  Telefunken  The company Telefunken was founded on May 27, 1903, as Telefunken society for wireless telefon of Siemens Halske and the Allgemeine Elektrizit ts Gesellschaft as joint undertakings for radio engineering in Berlin. It continued as a joint venture of AEG and Siemens AG, until Siemens left in 1941. In 1911, Kaiser Wilhelm II sent Telefunken engineers to West Sayville, New York to erect three 600 foot radio towers there. Nikola Tesla assisted in the construction. A similar station was erected in Nauen, creating the only wireless communication between North America and Europe.  Reginald Fessenden  The invention of amplitude modulated radio, so that more than one station can send signals is attributed to Reginald Fessenden and Lee de Forest. According to some sources, notably Fessenden's wife Helen's biography, on Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden used an Alexanderson alternator and rotary spark gap transmitter to make the first radio audio broadcast, from Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing O Holy Night on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible. However, Fessenden himself never mentioned that date: rather, he wrote of experiments with voice as early as 1902. And some of his experiments with voice and music, which occurred in mid to late December 1906, were reported in the American Telephone Journal.  Later 20th century developments Following development of transistor technology, bipolar junction transistors led to the development of the transistor radio. In 1954, Regency introduced a pocket transistor radio, the TR 1, powered by a standard 22.5V Battery . In 1955, the newly formed Sony company introduced its first transistorized radio, the TR 55. In 1957, Sony introduced the TR 63, the first mass produced transistor radio, leading to the mass market penetration of transistor radios. It was small enough to fit in a vest pocket, and able to be powered by a small battery. It was durable, because there were no tubes to burn out. Over the next twenty years, transistors displaced tubes almost completely except for picture tubes and very high power or very high frequency uses. In the early 1960s, VOR systems finally became widespread for aircraft navigation; before that, aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation. . By the mid 1960s, the Radio Corporation of America were using metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in their consumer products, including FM radio, television and amplifiers. Metal oxide semiconductor large scale integration provided a practical and economic solution for radio technology, and was used in mobile radio systems by the early 1970s.In the 1970s, LORAN became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the US Navy experimented with satellite navigation. In 1987, the Global Positioning System constellation of satellites was launched.  Telex on radio  Telegraphy did not go away on radio. Instead, the degree of automation increased. On land lines in the 1930s, teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex. For thirty years, telex was the cheapest form of long distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents. Telex systems were adapted to short wave radio by sending tones over single sideband. CCITT R.44 incorporated character level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex on radio was the only reliable way to reach some third world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less expensive forms of e mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio. Documents including maps and photographs went by radiofax, or wireless photoradiogram, invented in 1924 by Richard H. Ranger of Radio Corporation of America . This method prospered in the mid 20th century and faded late in the century.  Radio navigation  Radio navigation plays an important role during war time, especially in World War II. Before the discovery of the crystal oscillator, radio navigation had many limits. However, as radio technology expanding, navigation is easier to use, and it provides a better position. Although there are many advantages, the radio navigation systems often comes with complex equipment such as the radio compass receiver, compass indicator, or the radar plan position indicator. All of these require users to obtain certain knowledge.  Color television  1953: NTSC compatible color television introduced in the US. 1962: Telstar 1, the first communications satellite, relayed the first publicly available live transatlantic television signal. Mid 1960s: Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor first used for television, by the Radio Corporation of America . The power MOSFET was later widely adopted for television receiver circuits.  Mobile phones  In 1947, AT T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis in 1946, AT T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time. Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing US 15 per month, plus 0.30 0.40 per local call, equivalent to about 176 per month and 3.50 4.75 per call.The development of metal oxide semiconductor large scale integration technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs and introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America through the 1980s and into the 2000s.  Radio broadcasting  The beginning of radio broadcasting started with different creations of developing the radio receivers and transmitter including the crystal sets and the first vacuum tubes. These help to transmit the radio waves for long distance broadcasting.  Crystal sets  The most common type of receiver before vacuum tubes was the crystal set, although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery. Inventions of the triode amplifier, motor generator, and detector enabled audio radio. The use of amplitude modulation , by which soundwaves can be transmitted over a continuous wave radio signal of narrow bandwidth was pioneered by Fessenden and Lee de Forest.The art and science of crystal sets is still pursued as a hobby in the form of simple un amplified radios that 'runs on nothing, forever'. They are used as a teaching tool by groups such as the Boy Scouts of America to introduce youngsters to electronics and radio. As the only energy available is that gathered by the antenna system, loudness is necessarily limited.  The first vacuum tubes  During the mid 1920s, amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. John Ambrose Fleming developed a vacuum tube diode. Lee de Forest placed a screen, added a grid electrode, creating the triode. The Dutch company Nederlandsche Radio Industrie and its owner engineer, Hanso Idzerda, made the first regular wireless broadcast for entertainment from its workshop in The Hague on 6 November 1919. The company manufactured both transmitters and receivers. Its popular program was broadcast four nights per week on AM 670 metres, until 1924 when the company ran into financial troubles. On 27 August 1920, regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in Argentina, pioneered by Enrique Tel maco Susini and his associates, and spark gap telegraphy stopped. On 31 August 1920 the first known radio news program was broadcast by station 8MK, the unlicensed predecessor of WWJ in Detroit, Michigan. In 1922 regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England. Early radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone. In the 1920s, the Westinghouse company bought Lee de Forest's and Edwin Armstrong's patent. During the mid 1920s, Amplifying vacuum tubes thermionic valves revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. Westinghouse engineers developed a more modern vacuum tube.  FM and television start  In 1933, FM radio was patented by inventor Edwin H. Armstrong. FM uses frequency modulation of the radio wave to reduce static and interference from electrical equipment and the atmosphere. In 1937, W1XOJ, the first experimental FM radio station after Armstrong's W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey, was granted a construction permit by the US Federal Communications Commission . In the 1930s, regular analog television broadcasting began in some parts of Europe and North America. By the end of the decade there were roughly 25,000 all electronic television receivers in existence worldwide, the majority of them in the UK. In the US, Armstrong's FM system was designated by the FCC to transmit and receive television sound.  FM in Europe  After World War II, FM radio broadcasting was introduced in Germany. At a meeting in Copenhagen in 1948, a new wavelength plan was set up for Europe. Because of the recent war, Germany was only given a small number of medium wave frequencies, which were not very good for broadcasting. For this reason Germany began broadcasting on UKW which was not covered by the Copenhagen plan. After some amplitude modulation experience with VHF, it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM. Because of this history FM Radio is still referred to as UKW Radio in Germany. Other European nations followed a bit later, when the superior sound quality of FM and the ability to run many more local stations because of the more limited range of VHF broadcasts were realized.  Political interest in the United Kingdom  The British government and the state owned postal services found themselves under massive pressure from the wireless industry and early radio adopters to open up to the new medium. In an internal confidential report from February 25, 1924, the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee stated: We have been asked 'to consider and advise on the policy to be adopted as regards the Imperial Wireless Services so as to protect and facilitate public interest.' It was impressed upon us that the question was urgent. We did not feel called upon to explore the past or to comment on the delays which have occurred in the building of the Empire Wireless Chain. We concentrated our attention on essential matters, examining and considering the facts and circumstances which have a direct bearing on policy and the condition which safeguard public interests.  Broadcast and copyright When radio was introduced in the early 1920s, many predicted it would kill the phonograph record industry. Radio was a free medium for the public to hear music for which they would normally pay. While some companies saw radio as a new avenue for promotion, others feared it would cut into profits from record sales and live performances. Many record companies would not license their records to be played over the radio, and had their major stars sign agreements that they would not perform on radio broadcasts.Indeed, the music recording industry had a severe drop in profits after the introduction of the radio. For a while, it appeared as though radio was a definite threat to the record industry. Radio ownership grew from two out of five homes in 1931 to four out of five homes in 1938. Meanwhile, record sales fell from 75 million in 1929 to 26 million in 1938 , though the economics of the situation were also affected by the Great Depression.The copyright owners were concerned that they would see no gain from the popularity of radio and the free music it provided. What they needed to make this new medium work for them already existed in previous copyright law. The copyright holder for a song had control over all public performances for profit. The problem now was proving that the radio industry, which was just figuring out for itself how to make money from advertising and currently offered free music to anyone with a receiver, was making a profit from the songs. The test case was against Bamberger's Department Store in Newark, New Jersey in 1922. The store was broadcasting music from its store on the radio station WOR. No advertisements were heard, except at the beginning of the broadcast which announced L. Bamberger and Co., One of America's Great Stores, Newark, New Jersey. It was determined through this and previous cases that Bamberger was using the songs for commercial gain, thus making it a public performance for profit, which meant the copyright owners were due payment. With this ruling the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers began collecting licensing fees from radio stations in 1923. The beginning sum was 250 for all music protected under ASCAP, but for larger stations the price soon ballooned to 5,000. Edward Samuels reports in his book The Illustrated Story of Copyright that radio and TV licensing represents the single greatest source of revenue for ASCAP and its composers  and a n average member of ASCAP gets about 150 200 per work per year, or about 5,000 6,000 for all of a member's compositions. Not long after the Bamberger ruling, ASCAP had to once again defend their right to charge fees, in 1924. The Dill Radio Bill would have allowed radio stations to play music without paying and licensing fees to ASCAP or any other music licensing corporations. The bill did not pass.  Regulations of radio stations in the U.S   Wireless Ship Act of 1910  Radio technology was first used for ships to communicate at sea. To ensure safety, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 marks the first time the U.S. government implies regulations on radio systems on ships. This act requires ships to have a radio system with a professional operator if they want to travel more than 200 miles offshore or have more than 50 people on board. However, this act had many flaws including the competition of radio operators including the two majors company . They tended to delay communication for ships that used their competitor's system. This contributed to the tragic incident of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.  Radio Act of 1912  In 1912, distress calls to aid the sinking Titanic were met with a large amount of interfering radio traffic, severely hampering the rescue effort. Subsequently, the US government passed the Radio Act of 1912 to help mitigate the repeat of such a tragedy. The act helps distinguish between normal radio traffic and emergency communication, and specifies the role of government during such an emergency.  The Radio Act of 1927  The Radio Act of 1927 gave the Federal Radio Commission the power to grant and deny licenses, and to assign frequencies and power levels for each licensee. In 1928 it began requiring licenses of existing stations and setting controls on who could broadcast from where on what frequency and at what power. Some stations could not obtain a license and ceased operations. In section 29, the Radio Act of 1927 mentioned that the content of the broadcast should be freely present, and the government cannot interfere with this.  The Communications Act of 1934  The introduction of the Communications Act of 1934 led to the establishment of the Federal Communications Commissions . The FCC's responsibility is to control the industry including telephone, telegraph, and radio communications. Under this Act, all carriers have to keep records of authorized interference and unauthorized interference. This Act also supports the President in time of war. If the government needs to use the communication facilities in time of war, they are allowed to.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was the first significant overhaul in over 60 years amending the work of theThe Communications Act of 1934. Coming only two dozen years after the breakup of AT T, the act sets out to move telecommunications into a state of competition with their markets and the networks they are a part of. Up to this point the effects of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have been seen, but some of the changes the Act set out to fix are still ongoing problems, such as being unable to create an open competitive market.  Licensed commercial public radio stations  The question of the 'first' publicly targeted licensed radio station in the U.S. has more than one answer and depends on semantics. Settlement of this 'first' question may hang largely upon what constitutes 'regular' programming It is commonly attributed to KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which in October 1920 received its license and went on the air as the first US licensed commercial broadcasting station on November 2, 1920, with the presidential election results as its inaugural show, but was not broadcasting daily until 1921. Technically, KDKA was the first of several already extant stations to receive a 'limited commercial' license. On February 17, 1919, station 9XM at the University of Wisconsin in Madison broadcast human speech to the public at large. 9XM was first experimentally licensed in 1914, began regular Morse code transmissions in 1916, and its first music broadcast in 1917. Regularly scheduled broadcasts of voice and music began in January 1921. That station is still on the air today as WHA. On August 20, 1920, 8MK, began broadcasting daily and was later claimed by famed inventor Lee de Forest as the first commercial station. 8MK was licensed to a teenager, Michael DeLisle Lyons, and financed by E. W. Scripps. In 1921 8MK changed to WBL and then to WWJ in 1922, in Detroit. It has carried a regular schedule of programming to the present and also broadcast the 1920 presidential election returns just as KDKA did. Inventor Lee de Forest claims to have been present during 8MK's earliest broadcasts, since the station was using a transmitter sold by his company. The first station to receive a commercial license was WBZ, then in Springfield, Massachusetts. Lists provided to the Boston Globe by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that WBZ received its commercial license on 15 September 1921; another Westinghouse station, WJZ, then in Newark, New Jersey, received its commercial license on November 7, the same day as KDKA did. What separates WJZ and WBZ from KDKA is the fact that neither of the former stations remain in their original city of license, whereas KDKA has remained in Pittsburgh for its entire existence. 2XG: Launched by Lee de Forest in the Highbridge section of New York City, that station began daily broadcasts in 1916. Like most experimental radio stations, however, it had to go off the air when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, and did not return to the air. 1XE: Launched by Harold J. Power in Medford, Massachusetts, 1XE was an experimental station that started broadcasting in 1917. It had to go off the air during World War I, but started up again after the war, and began regular voice and music broadcasts in 1919. However, the station did not receive its commercial license, becoming WGI, until 1922. WWV, the U.S. Government time service, which was believed to have started 6 months before KDKA in Washington, D.C. but in 1966 was transferred to Ft. Collins, Colorado. WRUC, the Wireless Radio Union College, located on Union College in Schenectady, New York; was launched as W2XQ KQV, one of Pittsburgh's five original AM stations, signed on as amateur station 8ZAE on November 19, 1919, but did not receive a commercial license until January 9, 1922.

            "text": "Delmonico's is the name of a series of restaurants that operated in New York City, with the present version located at 56 Beaver Street in the Financial District of Manhattan. The original version was widely recognized as the United States first fine dining restaurant. Beginning as a small cafe and pastry shop in 1827, Delmonico s eventually grew into a hospitality empire that encompassed several luxury restaurants catering to titans of industry, the political elite and cultural luminaries. In many respects, Delmonico s represented the genesis of American fine dining cuisine, pioneering numerous restaurant innovations, developing iconic American dishes, and setting a standard for dining excellence. Ultimately, Delmonico s under the Delmonico family closed in 1923.  History   Origin  The original Delmonico's opened in 1827 in a rented pastry shop at 23 William Street, and appeared in a list of restaurants in 1830. It was opened by Italian Swiss immigrants, the brothers Giovanni and Pietro Delmonico. In 1831, they were joined by their nephew, Lorenzo, who eventually became responsible for the restaurant's wine list and menu.The brothers moved their restaurant several times before settling at 56 Beaver Street . When the building was opened on a grand scale in August 1837 after the Great Fire of New York, New Yorkers were told that the columns by the entrance had been imported from the ruins of Pompeii. It eventually became one of the most famous restaurants in New York, with its reputation eventually growing to national prominence.  Expansion and closure  Beginning in the 1850s, the restaurant hosted the annual gathering of the New England Society of New York, which featured many important speakers of the day. In 1860, Delmonico's provided the supper at the Grand Ball welcoming the Prince of Wales at the Academy of Music on East 14th Street. Supper was set out in a specially constructed room; the menu was French, and the pi ces mont es represented Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Great Eastern and Flora's Vase. The New York Times reported, We may frankly say that we have never seen a public supper served in a more inapproachable fashion, with greater discretion, or upon a more luxurious scale . In 1862, the restaurant hired Charles Ranhofer, considered one of the greatest chefs of his day. In 1876 news of the prices at Delmonicos restaurants spread at least as far as Colorado where complaints about the cost of wine, eggs, bread and butter, coffee, and potatoes appeared in the Pueblo Daily ChieftainThe business was so successful that from 1865 to 1888, it expanded to four restaurants of the same name. At various times, there were Delmonico's at ten locations. Delmonico's vacated the six story Delmonico Building at Fifth Avenue and 26th Street in 1899. The edifice was sold to John B. Martin, owner of the Martin Hotel, in May 1901.In 1919, Edward L.C. Robins purchased Delmonico's. Its grand location at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street closed in 1923 as a result of changing dining habits due to Prohibition. That location was the final incarnation of Delmonico's with continuity to the original.  Later revivals In 1926, Oscar Tucci purchased the restaurant and opened Oscar's Delmonico at 56 Beaver Street. The Tucci incarnation adopted the original menus and recipes, and became distinguished in its own right, continuing to attract prominent politicians and celebrities, such as Lana Turner, Marilyn Monroe, Rock Hudson, Lena Horne, Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis, JFK, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and others. Tucci also instituted many of the professional standards in use today in American restaurants know as the Delmonico way. The Tucci era also produced three of the most prominent restaurateurs of the twentieth century: Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque, Tony May of San Domenico and the Rainbow Room, and Harry Poulakakos of Harry's located in Hanover Square. Oscar's Delmonico was open continuously until it closed in 1977. The interior was gutted thereafter. In 1984 Tucci s son Mario opened a Delmonico's in Greenwich, Connecticut which closed in 1987.Edward Huber opened a new Delmonico's in 1982 at 56 Beaver Street, operating it until 1993. In 1997, the BiCE Group took full ownership of the restaurant, renovated the location and reopened Delmonico's with Gian Pietro Branchi as executive chef. The restaurant reopened in May 1998 following a renovation by Morris Nathanson. In 1999, the restaurant was sold to the Ocinomled partnership. The restaurant was forced to close temporarily in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic in New York City, and 56 Beaver Street's owner Time Equities was in the process of evicting the restaurant by 2022.  Signature dishes Delmonico Potatoes were invented at Delmonico's restaurant, and possibly Chicken la King, but it was most famous for Delmonico steak. Eggs Benedict were also said to have originated at Delmonico's, although others claim that dish as well.It is often said that the name Baked Alaska was coined at Delmonico's as well, in 1867, by chef Charles Ranhofer. However, no contemporary account exists of this occurrence and Ranhofer himself referred to the dish, in 1894, as Alaska Florida , apparently referring to the contrast between extremes of heat and cold. It is also said that Lobster Newberg was invented at the restaurant.Under Oscar Tucci's ownership of Delmonico's, he created the wedge salad. After a trip to a Bridgeport, Connecticut farm, Tucci picked the ingredients that became the salad. Tucci added bacon to the dish shortly after. The salad became an instant favorite, though some restaurateurs criticized the salad saying it was drenched in dressing. Today the wedge salad is served internationally.  Notable patrons Among the many well known people who patronized Delmonico's are Jenny Lind, who, it was said, ate there after every show; Theodore Roosevelt; Chester Arthur; Mark Twain; Arthur Sullivan; Diamond Jim Brady; Lillian Russell, usually in the company of Brady; Charles Dickens; Oscar Wilde; J.P. Morgan; James Gordon Bennett, Jr.; Nikola Tesla; Commodore Matthew C. Perry; Edward VII while Prince of Wales; and Napoleon III of France. Journalist Jacob A. Riis said he was a patron of a different sort: in his book The Making of an American, he stated that when he was down on his luck a kindly French speaking cook at Delmonico's would pass him rolls through the basement window.Clarence Day, Jr. wrote of eating lunch at Delmonico's with his father in his collection of short stories Life with Father. In the 1947 film of the same name, a scene takes place in the restaurant; it likely recreates the William Street location.Under the Tucci ownership, Delmonico s also known as Oscar s Delmonico or OlDelmonico's served Hollywood's elite, Politicians and Businesses Tycoons such as JFK, President Nixon, Malcolm Forbes, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Lena Horne, Lana Turner, The Gabor Sisters, Eva Gabor and Zsa Zsa Gabor, Red Buttons, Virginia Graham, Liberace. Katyna Ranieri, Bella Abzug and Gypsy Rose Lee.In recent years, the restaurant served Academy Award Winners Denzel Washington and Whoopi Goldberg.  Other Delmonico's restaurants The New Orleans, Louisiana, Delmonico's, which opened in 1895, was purchased by Emeril Lagasse in 1997. Lagasse refurbished the restaurant and reopened it as Emeril's Delmonico. Emeril's Delmonico has no connection to Delmonico's in New York City at 56 Beaver Street.. Since 1923, there have been four different owners of a restaurant named Delmonico s located at 56 Beaver Street, none of which are connected to the original Delmonico family.Delmonico's Italian Steakhouse is a chain of restaurants with six locations in Upstate New York and Florida. This chain has no connection the Delmonico's Restaurant located at 56 Beaver Street.

            "text": "Jonathan Adolf Wilhelm Zenneck was a German physicist and electrical engineer who contributed to researches in radio circuit performance and to the scientific and educational contributions to the literature of the pioneer radio art. Zenneck improved the Braun cathode ray tube by adding a second deflection structure at right angles to the first, which allowed two dimensional viewing of a waveform. This two dimensional display is fundamental to the oscilloscope.  Early years Zenneck was born in Ruppertshofen, W rttemberg. In 1885, Zenneck entered the Evangelical Theological Seminary in Maulbronn. In 1887, while in a Blaubeuren seminary, Zenneck learned Latin, Greek, French, and Hebrew. In 1889, Zenneck enrolled in the University of T bingen. At the T bingen Seminary, he studied mathematics and natural sciences. In 1894, Zenneck took the state examination in mathematics and natural sciences and the examination for his doctor's degree. His dissertation, supervised by Theodor Eimer, was on grass snake embryos. In 1894, Zenneck conducted zoological research . Between 1894 and 1895, he served in the military.  Middle years In 1895, Zenneck left zoology and turned over to the new field of radio science, He became assistant to Ferdinand Braun and lecturer at Physikalisches Institut in Strasbourg, Alsace. Nikola Tesla's lectures introduced him to the wireless sciences. In 1899, Zenneck started propagation studies of wireless telegraphy, first over land, but then became more interested in the larger ranges that were reached over sea. In 1900 he started ship to coast experiments in the North Sea near Cuxhaven, Germany. in 1902 he conducted tests of directional antennas. In 1905, Zenneck left Strasbourg since he was appointed assistant professor at the Danzig Technische Hochschule and in 1906, he became professor of experimental physics in the Braunschweig Technische Hochschule. Also in 1906, Zenneck wrote Electromagnetic Oscillations and Wireless Telegraphy , the then standard textbook on the subject . In 1909, he joined Badische Anilin und Sodafabrik in Ludwigshafen to experiment with electrical discharges in air to produce bound nitrogen as fertilizer. In 1913, he became director of the newly created Physics Institute of the Technische Hochschule M nchen. Zenneck analyzed solutions to Maxwell's equations that are localized around an interface between a conducting medium and a non conducting medium. In these solutions, the electric field strength decays exponentially in each medium as distance from the interface increases. These waves are sometimes called Zenneck waves. Zenneck analyzed plane wave solutions having this property; he also analyzed solutions with cylindrical symmetry having this property.  Later years Around World War I, Zenneck served on the front lines as a captain in the Marines. However, in 1914, the German government sent him and Karl Ferdinand Braun to the United States as technical advisor in a patent case involving Telefunken. The US Marconi Company sued Telefunken for patent infringement, a case spurred by the British government in an attempt to shut down transatlantic wireless telegraph between the US and Germany. The case stalled and event went moot when the United States entered the war, declaring Zenneck a Prisoner of War. He was dismissed only in 1920 when he could finally take over the professorship of experimental physics at the Technische Hochschule M nchen. In that time he resumed propagation studies, now with shortwaves and was first in Germany to study the Ionosphere with vertical sounding at his station at Kochel Bavaria. From the 1930s, Zenneck directed the Deutsches Museum in Munich, and rebuilt it after World War II. Zenneck was awarded the 1928 IRE Medal of Honor for his achievements in basic research on radio technology and for fostering academic and technical offspring he received the Siemens Ring in 1956.

            "text": "Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport or Belgrade Airport  is an international airport serving Belgrade, Serbia. It is the largest and busiest airport in Serbia, situated 18 km west of downtown Belgrade near the suburb of Sur in, surrounded by fertile lowlands. It is operated by French conglomerate Vinci Airports and it is named after Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla . The flag carrier and largest airline of Serbia, Air Serbia, uses Belgrade Nikola Tesla as their hub. It is also one of the many operating bases for low cost airline Wizz Air. The air taxi services Air Pink, Eagle Express and Prince Aviation also call the airport their home.  History   First airfields  The first airfield in Belgrade was inaugurated in 1910 in the neighbourhood of Banjica and was initially used by aviation pioneers such as Simon, Maslenikov, Vidmar and ermak. Two years later a wooden hangar was built for the Serbian Air Force, which was at the time engaged in the First Balkan War against Turkey. In 1914, the Banjica airfield was the base for the Serbian Air Force squadron and the Balloon Company. After the end of the First World War, the Banjica airfield was used for airmail traffic and included the routes Novi Sad Belgrade Ni Skoplje and Belgrade Sarajevo Mostar.In 1911 another airfield was inaugurated in Belgrade, in the lower city of the Kalemegdan Fortress at the location of today's Belgrade Planetarium.  Airport in Pan evo  An airport on the outskirts of Pan evo, a town located northeast of Belgrade, began its operations in 1923 when CFRNA inaugurated the international route Paris Istanbul which was flown via Belgrade. It was on that route that same year that the first world night flight ever happened in history. The same year airmail service began operating from the airport. The Pan evo airport was also used by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force academy. After the World War II the airport was used by the Yugoslav Air Force before it became the airfield of the Utva Aviation Industry after its relocation from Zemun to Pan evo.  Airport in Dojno Polje  Because of the distance from Pan evo to downtown Belgrade, which at that time required crossing the Danube, a decision was made to build a new airport which would be closer. The airport was planned to be built just across the river Sava, in a neighborhood today known as Novi Beograd. It was opened on 25 March 1927 under the official name of Belgrade International Airport . From February 1928, the aircraft owned by the first local airline Aeroput started taking off from the new airport. The airport had four 1,100 2,900 metres long grass runways. The design for a reinforced concrete hangar that was built at the airfield was made by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovi , better known for his theory of climate change. A modern terminal building was built in 1931, while the landing equipment for conditions of poor visibility was installed in 1936.Before World War II, Belgrade was also used as a stopover for some major air races, such as The Schlesinger African Air Race.Besides Aeroput, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, Imperial Airways and airlines from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Poland also used the airport until the outbreak of the Second World War. Belgrade gained further prominence when Imperial Airways introduced inter continental routes through Belgrade, when London was linked with India through the airport. Belgrade was linked with Paris and Breslau because CIDNA and Deutsche Luft Hansa, respectively, included Belgrade on its routes to Istanbul. By 1931, Belgrade became a major air hub being linked with regular flights with international destinations such as London, Madrid, Venice, Brussels, Berlin, Cologne, Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Varna, Thessaloniki, Athens, Istanbul, and also intercontinental links with Cairo, Karachi and India.Starting from April 1941, German occupation forces used the airport. During 1944 it was bombed by the Allies, and in October of the same year the German army destroyed the remaining facilities while withdrawing from the country.The airport was rebuilt by October 1944 and until the end of the war was used by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as part of the Allied war effort.Civil transport by Yugoslav Air Force cargo planes from this airport was reinstated at the end of 1945. At the beginning of 1947 JAT Yugoslav Airlines and JUSTA took over domestic and international traffic, and from 1948 Western European airlines resumed flights to Belgrade.A constant increase in traffic and the beginning of the passenger jet era called for a significant expansion of the airport. In the meantime, a plan to build a residential and business district called Novi Beograd on the location of the airport was introduced. The officials decided therefore that a new international airport should be built near the village of Sur in to the west. The last flight to depart from the old airport was early in 1964.  Airport in Sur in  The new location for the airport was on the Sur in plateau, 15 km from Belgrade's city center. Thanks to the original planners' vision, two conditions for the airport's development were fulfilled: a location was chosen which met the navigational, meteorological, construction, technical, and traffic requirements; and the special needs for the airport's long term development were established.Building of the new airport started in April 1958 and lasted until 28 April 1962, when it was officially opened by President Josip Broz Tito. During that period a 3,000 metre long runway was built, with the parallel taxiway and concrete aprons for sixteen airplanes. The passenger terminal building occupied an area of 8,000 m2 . Cargo storage spaces were also built, as well as a technical block with the air traffic control tower and other accompanying facilities. Modern navigational equipment was installed, earning the airport the highest international classification according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.The airport stagnated during the 1990s after the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the United Nations sanctions imposed on the Serbia and Montenegro. The sanctions also included a ban on air travel. The airport had minimal passenger movement, and many facilities were in need of reparation. With a change in government and international sentiment, normal air traffic resumed in 2001. A few years later the airport's terminal 2 underwent a major reconstruction. The runway was upgraded to CAT IIIb in 2005, as part of a large renovation project. CAT IIIb is an Instrument Landing System , giving aircraft the security of landing during fog and storms. In 2006, the airport was renamed to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Nikola Tesla was a Serbian American inventor and scientist, generally considered one of the world's most famous inventors. The construction of the new air traffic control center was completed in 2010. In 2011 Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport shares began trading on the Belgrade Stock Exchange .  2012 2018  In 2012, construction work on the modernization and expansion of the airport began. It was carried out on the expansion and reconstruction of the A gate and C gate departure and transit areas. As a result, an extra 2,750 square metres was added. Jetways at the A and C gates were also replaced. Also, there were plans for the construction of a new control tower as the current air control tower was built in 1962. Future expansion of current terminals should see additional 17,000 sqm added, with terminal 2 getting additional 4 jetways.  2018 present  In January 2018, the Government of Serbia granted a 25 year concession of the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the French airport operator Vinci Airports for a sum of 501 million euros. On 21 December 2018, Vinci formally took over the airport. In 2018, the airport had a sizeable increase in revenue and net income, due to Vinci Airports transaction.  Terminals Airport two terminals have a combined area of 33,000 sqm, with Terminal 2 being larger of the two, adjacent to one another terminals are connected through a hallway. The airport has 66 check in counters and 27 gates .  Terminal 1  Terminal 1 was the original and only terminal when the airport was built. The terminal handled domestic flights during the time of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro, and subsequently has come to be used for international flights, mostly by low cost and charter airlines. The terminal went through a major renovation in 2016 and 2017 when the interior was overhauled.  Terminal 2  Terminal 2 was constructed in 1979 for the airport's growing passenger numbers. The terminal has a capacity of 5 million passengers. The terminal contains airline offices, transfer desks and various retail shops. The terminal went through two major renovations: from 2004 through 2006, with the arrivals and departures areas of the terminal completely reconstructed, and another one in 2012 and 2013 when there were works on expansion and overhaul of the C platform. While not officially confirmed, it is believed that the overhauled T1 will be used by foreign carriers, while Air Serbia and Etihad Airways Partners would gain exclusive use of Terminal 2.  Airlines and destinations   Passenger  The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights as of October 2022:  Cargo  The following cargo airlines served the airport on a regular basis:  Statistics   Traffic figures   Passenger numbers   Busiest routes   Services   Security  Before the 2020 2021 2023 remodeling, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built with only one airside hallway for both departing and arriving passengers. As such, security checks used to be located at gate entrances rather than on a central location. As of 2021, however, there is a central security hall directly above the ticketing area, before passport control, where all passengers must be screened. Passport controls are placed on two entrances and the single exit of the hallway. All passengers must pass the passport control, as there are no domestic flights. An additional security check used to exist on the hallway entrance, but it was removed in 2013 as it inconvenienced passengers and was not essential for security.In 2007 the airport prohibited cars parking next to the airport terminal, instead they have to use the car park provided, as a result of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.  Lounges  Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport offers a single business class lounge, Business Club, for all airlines operating from the airport. Business Club , opened in 2011, covers an area of 250 m2 , and seats 30 guests. Airport also has a VIP lounge, with separate check in and passport control facilities also used by general aviation customers. The lounge consists of three parts the first part for leisure, second for television crew and press conferences and a third part is a presidential suite. The lounge has a total surface area of 500 m2 . The lounge is also used as a press centre, upon the arrival of VIPs. Air Serbia Premium Lounge is the first dedicated airline owned and operated lounge at the airport. It is open from 5 am 8pm every day for Air Serbia Etihad Airways business class passengers, as well as members of the Air Serbia Etihad Guest frequent flyer program and other passengers who purchase one time lounge access.  Ground transport   Car  The airport is connected to the A3 motorway via a nearby interchange. The toll station on A3 is located to the west of the interchange, and the sections to the Belgrade downtown and the Belgrade bypass are toll free. Licensed taxis from the airport to the city are available.  Bus  The following scheduled bus services connect the airport with its surroundings:  Rail  The airport does not yet have a rail connection to the city. But it is planned to build such a link.

            "text": "Stanford White was an American architect. He was also a partner in the architectural firm McKim, Mead White, one of the most significant Beaux Arts firms. He designed many houses for the rich, in addition to numerous civic, institutional, and religious buildings. His temporary Washington Square Arch was so popular that he was commissioned to design a permanent one. His design principles embodied the American Renaissance . In 1906, White was shot and killed at the Madison Square Theatre by Harry Kendall Thaw, in front of a large audience during a musical theatre performance. Thaw was a wealthy but mentally unstable heir of a coal and railroad fortune who had become obsessed by White's alleged drugging, rape and subsequent relationship with his wife Evelyn Nesbit, which started when she was 16, four years before their marriage. She had married Thaw in 1905 and was a famous fashion model who was performing as an actress in the show. With the elements of a sex scandal among the wealthy and the public killing, the resulting sensational trial of Thaw was dubbed The Trial of the Century by contemporary reporters. Thaw was ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity.  Early life and training White was born in New York City in 1853, the son of Richard Grant White, a Shakespearean scholar, and Alexina Black . His father was a dandy and Anglophile with little money but with many connections to New York's art world, including the painter John LaFarge, the stained glass artist Louis Comfort Tiffany, and the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.White had no formal architectural training; like many other architects at the time, he learned on the job as an apprentice. Beginning at age 18, he worked for six years as the principal assistant to Henry Hobson Richardson, known for his personal style and considered by many to have been the greatest American architect of his day.In 1878, White embarked on a year and a half tour of Europe, to learn about historical styles and trends. When he returned to New York in September 1879, he joined two young architects, Charles Follen McKim and William Rutherford Mead, to form the firm of McKim, Mead and White. As part of the partnership, they agreed to credit all of the firm's designs as the work of the collective firm, not to be attributed to any individual architect.In 1884, White married 22 year old Bessie Springs Smith, daughter of J. Lawrence Smith. She was from a socially prominent Long Island family. Her ancestors had settled in what became Suffolk County in the colonial era, and Smithtown, was named for them. The White couple's estate, Box Hill, was both a home and a showplace for the luxe design aesthetic which White offered to prospective wealthy clients. Their son, Lawrence Grant White, was born in 1887.  McKim, Mead and White   Commercial and civic projects  In 1889, White designed the triumphal arch at Washington Square, which, according to White's great grandson, architect Samuel G. White, is the structure for which White should be best remembered. White was director of the Washington Centennial celebration. His temporary triumphal arch was so popular, that money was raised to construct a permanent version.Elsewhere in New York City, White designed the Villard Houses , the second Madison Square Garden , the Cable Building at 611 Broadway , the baldechin and altars of Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph at St. Paul the Apostle Church, the New York Herald Building , and the IRT Powerhouse on 11th Avenue and 58th Street. White also designed the Bowery Savings Bank Building at the intersection of the Bowery and Grand Street , Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square, the Century Club, Madison Square Presbyterian Church, as well as the Gould Memorial Library , originally for New York University. It is now part of the campus of Bronx Community College and is the site of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. White was also commissioned for churches, estates and other major buildings outside New York City: The First Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland , now Lovely Lane United Methodist Church. The Cosmopolitan Building, a three story Neo classical Revival building topped by three small domes, built in Irvington, New York, in 1895 as headquarters of Cosmopolitan Magazine. Cocke, Rouss, and Cabell halls at the University of Virginia. In 1889, he reconstructed the university's Rotunda, three years after it had burned down. The Blair Mansion at 7711 Eastern Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland . In the early 21st century, it was being used as commercial space, for a violin store. The Boston Public Library, on Copley Square, Boston, Massachusetts. The Benjamin Walworth Arnold House and Carriage House in Albany, New York.He helped to develop Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower, his last design. White designed several clubhouses that became centers for New York society, and which still stand: the Century, Colony, Harmonie, Lambs, Metropolitan, and The Players clubs. He designed two golf clubhouses. His Shinnecock Hills Golf Clubhouse design in Suffolk County on the South Shore is said to be the oldest golf clubhouse in the United States, and has been designated as a golf landmark. Palmetto Golf Club in Aiken, South Carolina boasts the second. It was completed in 1902. His clubhouse for the Atlantic Yacht Club, built in 1894 overlooking Gravesend Bay, burned down in 1934. Sons of society families resided in White's St. Anthony Hall Chapter House at Williams College; the building is now used for college offices.  Residential properties  In the division of projects within the firm, the sociable and gregarious White landed the most commissions for private houses. His fluent draftsmanship helped persuade clients who were not attuned to a floorplan. He could express the mood of a building he was designing. Many of White's Long Island mansions have survived. Harbor Hill was demolished in 1947, originally set on 688 acres in Roslyn. These houses can be classified as three types, depending on their locations: Gold Coast chateaux along the wealthiest tier, mostly in Nassau County; neo Colonial structures, especially those in the neighborhood of his own house at Box Hill in Smithtown, Suffolk County; and the South Fork houses in Suffolk County, from Southampton to Montauk Point, influenced by their coastal location. He also designed the Kate Annette Wetherill Estate in 1895. White designed a number of other New York mansions as well, including the Iselin family estate All View and Four Chimneys in New Rochelle, suburban Westchester County. White designed several country estate homes in Greenwich, Connecticut, including the Seaman Brush House , now the Stanton House Inn, operated as a bed and breakfast. In New York's Hudson Valley, he designed the 1896 Mills Mansion in Staatsburg. Among his cottages in Newport, Rhode Island, at Rosecliff he adapted Mansart's Grand Trianon. The mansion was built for large receptions, dinners, and dances with spatial planning and well contrived dramatic internal views en filade. His informal shingled cottages usually featured double corridors for separate circulation, so that a guest never bumped into a laundress with a basket of bed linens. Bedrooms were characteristically separated from hallways by a dressing room foyer lined with closets, so that an inner door and an outer door gave superb privacy. One of the few surviving urban residences designed by White is the Ross R. Winans Mansion in Baltimore's Mount Vernon Belvedere neighborhood. It is now used as the headquarters for Agora, Inc. Built in 1882 for Ross R. Winans, heir to Ross Winans, the mansion is a premier example of French Renaissance revival architecture. Since its period as Winans's residence, it has served as a girls preparatory school, doctor's offices, and a funeral parlor, before being acquired by Agora Publishing. In 2005, Agora completed an award winning renovation project.White designed Golden Crest Estate in Elberon Park, NJ while at McKim Mead and White for E. F. C. Young, President of the First National Bank of Jersey City and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for New Jersey Governor in 1892. He built the house in 1901, as a golden wedding anniversary gift for Young's wife Harriet. In 1929, the house was sold to Victor and Edmund Wisner, who ran it as a rooming house for summer vacationers. In the 1960s, it was a fraternity house for the then Monmouth College. From 1972 to 1976, it was owned and restored by Mary and Samuel Weir. It is now a private residence. White lived the same life as his clients, albeit not quite so lavishly, and he knew how the house had to perform: like a first rate hotel, theater foyer, or a theater set with appropriate historical references. He could design a cover for Scribner's Magazine or design a pedestal for his friend Augustus Saint Gaudens's sculpture. He extended the limits of architectural services to include interior decoration, dealing in art and antiques, and planning and designing parties. He collected paintings, pottery, and tapestries for use in his projects. If White could not acquire the right antiques for his interiors, he would sketch neo Georgian standing electroliers or a Renaissance library table. His design for elaborate picture framing, the Stanford White frame, still bears his name today. Outgoing and social, he had a large circle of friends and acquaintances, many of whom became clients. White had a major influence in the Shingle Style of the 1880s, Neo Colonial style, and the Newport cottages for which he is celebrated. He designed and decorated Fifth Avenue mansions for the Astors, the Vanderbilts , and other high society families.  Personal life White, a tall, flamboyant man with red hair and a red mustache, impressed some as witty, kind, and generous. The newspapers frequently described him as masterful , intense , burly yet boyish . He was a collector of rare and costly artwork and antiquities. He maintained a multi story apartment with a rear entrance on 24th Street in Manhattan. One room was painted green and outfitted with a red velvet swing, which hung from the ceiling suspended by ivy twined ropes. He used playing with the elaborate swing as a means to groom under age girls for a sexual relationship, including Evelyn Nesbit, a popular photographer's fashion model and chorus dancer. After White was killed and the newspapers began to investigate his life, continuing through the trial of Thaw, the married architect's sexual relations with numerous underage girls were revealed. The White family historian Suzannah Lessard writes: The process of seduction was a major feature of Stanford's obsession with sex, and it was an inexorable kind of seduction which moved into the lives of very young women, sometimes barely pubescent girls, in fragile social and financial situations girls who would be unlikely to resist his power and his money and his considerable charm, who would feel that they had little choice but to let him take over their lives. There are indications that Stanford would sometimes adopt the role of a paternal benefactor, and then would take advantage of the trust and gratitude that had been built. White belonged to an underground sex circle, made up of select members from the Union Club, a legitimate men's club. According to Simon Baatz: He was one of a group of wealthy rou s, all members of the Union Club, who organized frequent orgies in secret locations scattered about the city. Other members of the group included Henry Poor, a financier; James Lawrence Breese, a wealthy man about town with an avocational interest in photography; Charles MacDonald, a stockbroker and principal shareholder in the Southern Pacific Railroad; and Thomas Clarke, a dealer in antiques. Mark Twain, who was acquainted with White, included an evaluation of his character in his Autobiography. It reflected Twain's deep immersion in the testimony of the Thaw murder trial. Twain said that New York society had known for years preceding the incident that the married White was eagerly and diligently and ravenously and remorselessly hunting young girls to their destruction. These facts have been well known in New York for many years, but they have never been openly proclaimed until now. On the witness stand, in the hearing of a court room crowded with men, the girl Evelyn Nesbit told in the minutest detail the history of White's pursuit of her, even down to the particulars of his atrocious victory a victory whose particulars might well be said to be unprintable... Based on White's correspondence, including that conducted with Augustus Saint Gaudens, recent biographers have concluded that White was bisexual, and that the office of McKim, Mead White was unruffled by this. White's granddaughter has written that Stanford's eldest son was unflinching in his awareness of Stanford's nature .  Murder  In 1901, White established a caretaking relationship with Evelyn Nesbit, helping Nesbit get established as a model for artists and photographers in New York society, with the approval of Nesbit's mother. Five years later, Nesbit would testify that one evening he invited her to his apartment for dinner and gave her champagne and possibly some drug, and then raped her after she passed out: she was about 16 years old at this time and White was 48.For a period of at least six months afterwards, they acted as lovers and companions. Although they drifted apart, they remained in touch with each other and on good terms socially. In 1905 she married Harry Kendall Thaw, a Pittsburgh millionaire with a history of severe mental instability. Thaw was jealous and thought of White as his rival. But, well before he was killed, White had moved on to other young women as lovers. White considered Thaw a poseur of little consequence and categorized him as a clown, once calling him the Pennsylvania pug  a reference to Thaw's baby faced features.Accompanied by New York society figure James Clinch Smith, White dined at Martin's, near the theatre at Madison Square Garden. As it happened, Thaw and Nesbit also dined there, and Thaw was said to have seen White at the restaurant.That evening the premiere of Mam'zelle Champagne was being performed at the theatre. During the show's finale, I Could Love A Million Girls , Thaw approached White, produced a pistol, said, You've ruined my wife , and fired three shots at White from two feet away. He hit White twice in the face and once in his upper left shoulder, killing him instantly. The crowd's initial reaction was to think the incident was an elaborate party trick. When it became apparent that White was dead, chaos ensued. Nineteen year old Lawrence Grant White was guilt ridden after his father was slain, blaming himself for the death. If only he had gone to Philadelphia ! he lamented, referring to a trip that had been planned. Years later, he would write, On the night of June 25th, 1906, while attending a performance at Madison Square Garden, Stanford White was shot from behind by a crazed profligate whose great wealth was used to besmirch his victim's memory during the series of notorious trials that ensued. White was buried in St. James, New York, in Suffolk County.  News coverage  Following the killing, there was blanket press coverage, as well as editorial speculation and gossip. Journalistic interest in the sensational story was sustained. William Randolph Hearst's newspapers played up the story, and the murder trial became known as The Trial of the Century .White's reputation was severely damaged by the testimony in the trial, as his sexual activities became public knowledge. The Evening Standard spoke of his social dissolution . The Nation reconsidered his architectural work: He adorned many an American mansion with irrelevant plunder. Newspaper accounts drew from the trial transcripts to describe White as a sybarite of debauchery, a man who abandoned lofty enterprises for vicious revels.  Defenses  Few friends or associates publicly defended White, as some feared possible exposure for having participated in White's secret life. McKim responded to inquiries saying, There is no statement to make...There will be no information coming from us. Richard Harding Davis, a war correspondent and reputedly the model for the Gibson Man , was angered by the press accounts, which he said presented a distorted view of his friend White. An editorial published in Vanity Fair, lambasting White, prompted Davis to a rebuttal. His article appeared on August 8, 1906, in Collier's magazine: Since his death White has been described as a satyr. To answer this by saying that he was a great architect is not to answer at all...He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.  Autopsy  The autopsy report, made public by the coroner's testimony at the Thaw trial, revealed that White was in poor health when killed. He suffered from Bright's disease, incipient tuberculosis, and severe liver deterioration.  In popular culture In The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing, a 1955 movie, Ray Milland played White. The 1975 historical fiction novel Ragtime by E. L. Doctorow The 1981 film Ragtime, adapted from the novel of the same name. White was played by writer Norman Mailer, Thaw by Robert Joy, and Nesbit by Elizabeth McGovern. The 1996 musical Ragtime, based on the novel Dementia Americana a long narrative poem by Keith Maillard My Sweetheart's the Man in the Moon a play by Don Nigro La fille coup e en deux  a 2007 film by Claude Chabrol was inspired, in part, by the Stanford White scandal. In the 2022 HBO series The Gilded Age, White is played by John Sanders.

            "text": "The Exposition Universelle of 1889 was a world's fair held in Paris, France, from 5 May to 31 October 1889. It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the Eiffel Tower.  Organization The Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of French Revolution, and was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty five thousand were from outside of France.  Admission price Admission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of an economy plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes. Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions. Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 francs, while income was 49,500,000 francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit.  National participation and boycotts The countries that officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, India, Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia, Saint Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the South African Republic, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela. The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part. Because of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition. The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.Nonetheless, many citizens and companies from those countries participated, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. They included Germany and Alsace Lorraine, Austria Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, the United Kingdom and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.  Exposition sites  The Exposition occupied two large sites. The main site was on Champs de Mars on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the Ecole Militaire, and had been occupied by the 1878 Universal Exposition. This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the Trocadero Palace, which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition. The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. A separate, smaller site was located on the esplanade of Les Invalides, which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. The colonial pavilions conveyed the multiculturalism of France's colonies, the largest of them being the Palais Central des Colonies, designed by Stephen Sauvestre, who notably contributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower. In addition to the architectural displays of France's colonies, the exposition showcased a construction of villages inhabited by natives of the colonies, to be observed by viewers. The colonized people had their daily lives displayed for the exposition visitors, which made some of them uncomfortable. Samba Lawb Thiam, a jeweler from Senegal who was part of the 1889 exposition, said the following: We are very humiliated to be exhibited this way, in huts like savages; these straw and mud huts do not give an idea of Senegal. In Senegal ... we have large buildings, railroad stations, railroads; we light them with electricity. The Bureau of Hygiene does not tolerate the construction of this type of hovel. Those existing ones that fall into disrepair are not replaced. The incorporation of indigenous colonized individuals in the exposition was intended to be an educational element, but has also historically been framed as an exploitative and patronizing display of colonized people without their consent.This colonial section of the exposition was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank. This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called The History of Human Habitation , with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Opera. There were twenty two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter. They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants. The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.  Views of the Exposition       Structures   The Eiffel Tower  The Eiffel Tower, built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called A tower of three hundred meters with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty. The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions. The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance. Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. The construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois Perret, a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son in law of Eiffel, declared, no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history. During the Exposition, no one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.In the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform, though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway. By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. When the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.      The Gallery of Machines  A second monumental building on the site was the Galerie des machines, by the architect Ferdinand Dutert and engineer Victor Contamin, which had originally been built for the Universal Exposition of 1878. It was a huge iron and glass structure which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 square meters of glass windows. At 111 meters, the Gallery covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. It was later used again at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 and then destroyed in 1910. The Gallery of Machines used a system of hinged arches made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.   Science and technology  One important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. Thomas Edison visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph with clearer sound quality. Another new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, Otis Elevator. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe. The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes. There were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery. Prefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition. Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel, and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina. Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers, can now be found in the Forest of Dampierre.      The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts  Other major buildings included the Palaces of Liberal and Fine Arts, each with a richly decorated dome, facing each other across a garden and reflecting pool between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. Both were designed by Jean Camille Formig with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. The Exposition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine Egyptian Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Sch lcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Sch lcher had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique.     Fountains  The Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch. The fountain was designed by Jean Camille Formig , who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The other major fountain, not far away, was The Five Parts of the World , illustrating the continents. It was designed by Francis de Saint Vidal.  The Street of Cairo and exotic habitations  The Rue de Caire was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of Cairo. It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it. It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal. It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings, a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo. The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies. The Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents.      The Pavilions of the participating nations and special industries  The Pavilions of the participating nations were located along the edge of the Champ de Mars. The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. The Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect Albert Ballu, who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1,600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments. After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to Buenos Aires, where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952.In addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electricity pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. The Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products. One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from Champagne Mercier that could hold 200,000 bottles of champagne.           Charles Garnier's History of Habitation  An unusual display was the History of Habitation , designed by Charles Garnier, the architect of the Paris Opera House named for him. He was then 61 and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera. Although he had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, that denounced the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation. The houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine.The houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas. The dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historical accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular. The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition.    Other buildings  Many smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition. The architect Hector Guimard, then just twenty two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis Bleriot , and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren. The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910. the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features. In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now a days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.  Music and entertainment The Exposition itself included several large theatres for concerts and spectacles, including one for the dancers of Les Follies Parisiens. A separate theatre presented the music and dance of the French colonies in Indochina. Operas and concerts were also given in the grand hall of the Trocadero Palace. The Op ra Comique premiered on 14 May 1889 with a work specially composed for that event: Jules Massenet's Esclarmonde . The Barnum and Bailey Circus performed during the Exposition in the Salle des Fetes of the Palais des Machines. At the Exposition, the French composer Claude Debussy first heard Javanese gamelan music, performed by an ensemble from Java. This influenced some of his later compositions.Outside the Exposition, other theatres and venues presented a range of spectacles including Buffalo Bill Cody and his Wild West Show, with the sharpshooter Annie Oakley.   Transportation the miniature train Transport around the Exposition was partly provided by the 3 kilometre 600 mm gauge Decauville railway at Exposition Universelle. The Exposition railroad was reported to have carried 6,342,446 visitors in just six months of operation. Some of the locomotives used on this line later saw service on the Chemins de fer du Calvados and the Di go Suarez Decauville railway.  Notable visitors and special events Celebrities and dignitaries from around the world visited the Exposition. Thomas Edison, with his wife and daughter, visited the Exposition on August 14, 1889, his third day in France, to visit the exhibit where his improved phonograph was being demonstrated. He also ascended to the viewing platform of the Eiffel Tower, where he was met by a group of Sioux Indians who were at the Exposition to perform in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He returned to the Eiffel Tower later in his visit , where he was hosted for a lunch in Eiffel's private apartment on the Tower, along with the composer Charles Gounod. A Negro village where 400 people were displayed was a popular attraction.Other prominent visitors included the Shah of Persia Nasereddin Shah, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Alexandra; artists Antoni Gaudi, James McNeill Whistler, Edvard Munch, Rosa Bonheur and Paul Gauguin; U.S. journalist and diplomat Whitelaw Reid; author Henry James; Filipino patriots Jos Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar; and inventors Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. A central attraction in the French section was the Imperial Diamond, at the time the largest diamond in the world.The Mexican pavilion featured a model of an exotic Aztec temple, a combination of archeology, history, architecture, and technology. The presentation of Joseph Farcot's steam engine, that had already won a prize in 1878.  Statistics Expenses: 41,500,000 Francs Receipts: 49,500,000 Francs Visitors: 32,250,297 Exhibitors: over 61,722, of whom 55 were French Countries represented: 35  Legacy Most of the buildings were on military land or city owned park land, and they were demolished shortly after the Exposition closed. The most notable survivor was the Eiffel Tower, which had been deliberately built on Paris city owned land, to avoid demolition. The Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine Egyptian Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France in Martinique and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Sch lcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Sch lcher had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique.

            "text": "Smiljan is a village in the mountainous region of Western Lika in Croatia. It is located 6 km northwest of Gospi , and fifteen kilometers from the Zagreb Split highway; its population is 418 . Smiljan is the birthplace of inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla.  Geography It consists of eighteen scattered hamlets . Smiljan resort is located in the central part of the Velebit Lika plain, on the western edge of the field at the foot of the hill Kr mar. It consists of twelve villages which makes the spatial and functional unit. In the surroundings are Hill forts Bogdani , Smiljan and Kr mar, prehistoric tombs, the churches of St. Anastasia, St. Mark and St. Vitus. It got its name from the fort Smiljan which ruins are located at hill Vekavac.  History The oldest traces of settlement on the ground of Smiljan are dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Age. On the hillfort Miljac once was situated necropolis, and were found numerous remains of Iapodian culture.The origin of the name Smiljan is not fully certain. It is commonly believed to be derived from smilje, the name for the Helichrysum plant. However, Croatian linguist Petar imunovi believed Smiljan is patronymic in origin. Another hypothesis focuses on milja, Croatian for mile , present in other toponyms such as Milja a hill, which suggests a connection with a nearby merchant road.The area of Smiljan was controlled by the Ottoman Empire between 1527 1686, after which the Ottoman rule was expelled from those parts by counts Jerko Rukavina and Dujam Kova evi . Until that time the Ottoman aghas, Rizvan and Zenkovi , from Novi near Gospi had estates in Smiljan, Bu im and Trnovac.After the defeat of the Ottomans in Lika, most of the Bunjevci migrated to Lika, including Smiljan between 1683 87. A 1700 church register listed 17 Serbian Orthodox families in the village, who had settled during the Great Turkish War. Villages and hamlets in Lika and Krbava were divided according to religious confession, Serbian Orthodox minority lived in the hamlets of Seli te, Ljuta a and Bogdani at that time.In 1708 the Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was founded. There is a small chapel, Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. The Serbian Orthodox church of St. Peter and Paul was built in 1765; it is now a branch of a parish in Gospi . The re construction of the Catholic parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was started in 1860, and finished 1864. In 1830 a minor school was founded.During World War II, the town was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Paveli 's Independent State of Croatia . The fascist Ustashe regime committed the Genocide of the Serbs and the Holocaust. The house in which the inventor Nikola Tesla was born, as well as the Serbian Orthodox church in which his father had served as a priest, were destroyed by the Ustashe movement in 1941. During the same period, the Usta e also established a concentration camp in Smiljan through which 5,000 inmates passed. The camp was part of a wider network of Usta e concentration camps centred around the town of Gospi .  Demography The village of Smiljan was incorporated to the Croatian Military Frontier only in 1713 , and subsequently registered in the 1712 14 census done in Lika and Krbava. In 1712 14 there were 1,405 1,536 people, with 1,153 1,283 people land owners, 117 landless , with average 1.33 acre per individual, 120 139 families who were land owners, with average 9.6 members in family.Most of them were Roman Catholic Vlachs ie Bunjevci , then Serbian Orthodox Vlachs , and Carniolians . There were 103 Roman Catholic, and 17 Serbian Orthodox families.Some of the most numerous families in Lika and Krbava were in Smiljan; of count and captain Nikola Rukavina Bevandi , Dujam Kova evi , Ivan Dev i , Mijat Lemaji , Juri a Pavi i , Milanko Pejnovi , Petar Serdar , Ilija Brklja i , and Anton Tomljenovi .In 1746 there lived 2,149 people, with 2,144 people land owners, and 290 families of land owners.206 houses existed in 1830, with 1,880 people, of whom 1,401 Roman Catholic, and 479 Orthodox faith. After some settlements got separated, in 1857 numbered only 110 houses with 1,132 people, of whom 535 Roman Catholic and 597 Orthodox faith, with further separation, in 1910 the hamlet numbered only 50 people, however whole municipality had 2,286 people, of whom 1,698 Roman Catholic, and 588 Orthodox faith. Note: In 1869 and 1880 contains data for villages Rastoka and Smiljansko Polje, while in 1857 part of data for Smiljansko Polje. A nearby village of Smiljansko Polje has 135 residents .  Tesla memorial complex  Due to celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the electricity pioneer and inventor Nikola Tesla, Croatian officials opened a Tesla memorial complex, including a museum inside his restored childhood home. Today, Tesla's birth house, together with the Serbian Orthodox church of St. Peter and Paul and the surrounding area, make up a memorial complex. There are various exhibits of Tesla's inventions and a museum where the details of the inventor's life are shown. There is also a congress hall in a nearby building. The original memorial complex was built in 1956.In 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence, several of the buildings were severely damaged by fire due to shelling. The Croatian authorities restored the complex and reopened it in a 2006 ceremony, with the highest dignitaries of Croatia and Serbia attending.

            "text": "The Office of Alien Property Custodian was an office within the government of the United States during World War I and again during World War II, serving as a custodian to property that belonged to US enemies. The office was created in 1917 by Executive Order 2729 A under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 in order to assume control and dispose of enemy owned property in the United States and its possessions.  History Sec. 6 of TWEA authorized the president to appoint an official known as the alien property custodian who is responsible for receiv ing, ... hold ing , administer ing , and account ing for all money and property in the United States due or belonging to an enemy, or ally of enemy ... . TWEA was originally enacted during World War I to permit, under careful safeguards and restrictions, certain kinds of business to be carried on among warring nations, and to provid e for the care and administration of the property and property rights of enemies and their allies in this country pending the war. Created in October 1917 within the United States Department of Justice, the Office of Alien Property Custodian ceased to exist in 1934 and its functions were delegated to the Alien Property Bureau in the Claims Division of the Department of Justice. On December 9, 1941, the APB was superseded in the Justice Department by the Alien Property Division . The APD was abolished in 1942 and its functions were passed along to the Office of Alien Property Custodian within the Office of Emergency Management. APC was abolished in 1946 and its functions were transferred to the Office of Alien Property, Department of Justice. It was abolished in 1966 and most of the functions related to foreign assets control were passed to the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the United States Department of the Treasury.  Lineage of successive agencies  Office of Alien Property Custodian, Department of Justice Alien Property Bureau, Department of Justice Alien Property Division, Department of Justice Office of Alien Property Custodian, Department of Justice Office of Alien Property, Department of Justice Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department  World War I  President Woodrow Wilson appointed A. Mitchell Palmer, a political ally and former Congressman, Alien Property Custodian in October 1917. Palmer held the position from October 22, 1917 until March 4, 1919. A wartime government official, the Custodian had responsibility for the seizure, administration, and sometimes the sale of enemy property in the United States. Palmer was also allowed to take control of property that might hinder the war effort, including all property belonging to interned immigrants, whether they had been charged with a crime or not. Palmer's background in law and banking qualified him for the position, along with his party loyalty and intimate knowledge of political patronage.: 128 Under Palmer's leadership, the Custodian employed hundreds of officials.  Seized assets  The size of the assets the Custodian controlled only became clear over the next year. In January 1918, The New York Times wrote that Palmer's organization turned into the biggest trust institution in the world, a director of vast business enterprises of varied nature, a detective agency, and a court of equity. Late in 1918, Palmer reported he was managing almost 30,000 trusts with assets worth half a billion dollars. He estimated that another 9,000 trusts worth 300,000,000 awaited evaluation. Many of the enterprises in question produced materials significant to the war effort, such as medicines, glycerin for explosives, charcoal for gas masks. Others included mines, brewing, and newspaper publishing. Palmer built a team of professionals with banking expertise as well as an investigative bureau to track down well hidden assets. Below the top level positions, he distributed jobs as patronage. For example, he appointed one of his fellow members of the Democratic National Committee to serve as counsel for a textile company and another the vice president of a shipping line.: 128 35 In September 1918, Palmer testified at hearings held by the U.S. Senate's Overman Committee that the United States Brewers Association and the rest of the overwhelmingly German liquor industry harbored pro German sentiments. He stated that German brewers of America, in association with the United States Brewers' Association had attempted to buy a great newspaper and control the government of State and Nation , had generally been unpatriotic , and had pro German sympathies . Palmer wanted to seize the estate of the late Adolphus Busch, whose wife was stranded in Europe during the war, and succeeded in seizing the property of another brewer, George Ehret.The assets of the Orenstein Koppel Company, the Bosch Magneto Company, the Hamburg American Shipping Line, the German American Lumber Company, the New York Evening Mail, as well as twenty German insurance companies, were seized. Among other significant seizures, the United States assets of the chemical company Bayer were auctioned off and it lost its U.S. patent for Aspirin. In April 1919, the president of the Chemical Foundation, Inc. and Palmer's successor Francis Patrick Garvan transferred 4,500 German chemical patents valued at 8 million to the Chemical Foundation, paying only 250,000; the Chemical Foundation in its turn licensed patents to American companies.  Disposal of confiscated property  Palmer said that the alien property custodian kept the biggest general store in the country. Altogether, the United States Government confiscated close to 500 million of foreign assets during WWI. In 1921, the Congress while adopting the Joint Resolution Terminating the State of War Between the Imperial German Government and the United States of America and Between the Imperial and Royal Austro Hungarian Government and the United States of America specified that all seized property had remained in the United States ownership; also, the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 was not terminated. It stayed dormant until March 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked it to enforce a week long Bank Holiday of 1933. In 1925, the Office of Alien Property Custodian still controlled 300 million worth of alien property, with half of that amount in cash.  Criticism and response  Later criticism of Palmer's and his successors performance, especially Thomas W. Miller's, focused less on legality of their appointments or the fees earned by political cronies but on sales of enemy assets. There were safeguards in place, but competitive bidding meant nothing when an auction was rigged by withholding information from all participants. More revelations took years to surface and the connections between Palmer and direct profits proved too tenuous to support his indictment. However, Thomas W. Miller was caught in the act and served jail time for taking a 50,000 bribe.Palmer successfully campaigned to keep the powers to sell confiscated assets within the office of custodian. He promised to hinder Germany's industrial expansion after the war. Even when Germany was facing an inevitable defeat, Palmer insisted on continuing his crusade to make American industry independent of German investment, with major sales of the seized assets in the metals industry in the spring of 1919, for example. He offered his rationale in a speech to an audience of lawyers: The war power is of necessity an inherent power in every sovereign nation. It is the power of self preservation and that power has no limits other than the extent of the emergency. : 135 50, quote 149  World War II era On 11 March 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9095 establishing the Office of the Alien Property Custodian as an independent agency under his direct authority. He appointed Leo Crowley, a former banker and chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as APC. During the war the APC amassed a vast portfolio of enemy property including real estate, business enterprises, ships and intellectual property in the form of trademarks, copyrights, patents and pending patent applications. Following Nikola Tesla's death at the New Yorker Hotel in 1943, the Custodian seized much of Tesla's work from his hotel room even though Tesla was an American citizen.In 1947, Assistant Attorney General David L. Bazelon took over as head of the Office of Alien Property Custodian. He remained in this post until he received a recess appointment from President Harry S. Truman on October 21, 1949, to a new seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Before he was seated on the bench, Harold L. Ickes, a key figure in the Roosevelt administration, indicated that Bazelon's activities as head of the Office of Alien Property Custodian warranted a Senate investigation but predicted none would be forthcoming.  1950s In 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Dallas Townsend Sr. Assistant United States Attorney General, heading the Justice Department's Alien Property Office, an office he held until 1960. Townsend supervised the seizure of enemy property and assets that had been seized during World War II.Testifying before a U.S. Subcommittee in 1957, Townsend argued that a return of 10 of seized enemy property was a sufficient amount. One of the most unfair aspects of a general return of all German and Japanese property is that it would donate huge windfalls to large enemy corporations, industrialists and their agents, many of whom were strong supporters of the militaristic and aggressive policies of the former Governments of Germany and Japan, he told Senators.Townsend seized 329 million in proceeds of Interhandel, a Swiss holding company, saying that it was a front for the real owner, IG Farben, the German chemical cartel.  Abolishment On May 13, 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11281 which abolished the office, effective June 30 of that year.

            "text": "Teleforce is a proposed defensive weapon by Nikola Tesla that accelerated pellets or slugs of material to a high velocity inside a vacuum chamber via electrostatic repulsion and then fired them out of aimed nozzles at intended targets. Tesla claimed to have conceived of it after studying the Van de Graaff generator. Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground based infantry or for anti aircraft purposes.  Description Tesla described Teleforce's operation in 1934, specifying its superiority to the death rays believed to exist at the time: My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. The nozzle would send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks. In a letter that was written to J. P. Morgan, Jr. on November 29, 1934, Tesla described the weapon: I have made recent discoveries of inestimable value... The flying machine has completely demoralized the world, so much that in some cities, as London and Paris, people are in mortal fear from aerial bombing. The new means I have perfected afford absolute protection against this and other forms of attack. ... These new discoveries, which I have carried out experimentally on a limited scale, have created a profound impression. One of the most pressing problems seems to be the protection of London and I am writing to some influential friends in England hoping that my plan will be adopted without delay. The Russians are very anxious to render their borders safe against Japanese invasion and I have made them a proposal which is being seriously considered. In 1937, Tesla wrote a treatise, The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non dispersive Energy through the Natural Media , concerning charged particle beam weapons. Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a 'superweapon that would put an end to all war. This treatise is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It describes an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non dispersive particle streams .  Death ray misnomer Teleforce was mentioned publicly in the New York Sun and The New York Times on July 11, 1934. The press called it a peace ray or death ray. The idea of a death ray was a misunderstanding in regard to Tesla's term when he referred to his invention as a death beam so Tesla went on to explain that this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so called 'death rays.' Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles ... What set Tesla's proposal apart from the usual run of fantasy death rays was a unique vacuum chamber with one end open to the atmosphere. Tesla devised a unique vacuum seal by directing a high velocity air stream at the tip of his gun to maintain high vacua . The necessary pumping action would be accomplished with a large Tesla turbine.  Components of Teleforce In total, the components and methods included: An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a high vacuum as in the past. A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force. A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism. A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.It has been said that the charged particles would self focus via gas focusing, . In 1940, Tesla estimated that each station would cost no more than 2,000,000 and could have been constructed in a few months.After Tesla died, in a box purported to contain a part of Tesla's death ray apparatus, John G. Trump found a 45 year old multidecade resistance box.  Attempts at development and marketing By November 1934, Tesla was attempting to obtain funding from J. P. Morgan's son, Jack Morgan. The idea of Tesla possibly having a new type of weapon and, further, his offer to give it to the League of Nations as a way to prevent future war were seen together as an alarming security threat by one US diplomat a view not shared by his government. In 1935, the Soviet Union, through the US Amtorg Trading Corporation, an alleged Soviet arms front in New York City, paid Tesla 25,000 for detailed plans, specifications, and complete information on the method and apparatus, but it is unclear whether a physical device was ever produced. Tesla also attempted to get funding for his device in 1937, sending a paper outlining his plans to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Yugoslavia. The United Kingdom considered Tesla's offer to sell the device to them for 30 million, maybe with the idea that even hinting they had a super weapon would be a deterrent to Adolf Hitler, but by 1938 they had dropped all interest.During this period, Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention, saying that his room had been entered and that his papers had been scrutinized, but that the thieves or spies had left empty handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen, for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper; the blueprint for the Teleforce weapon was all in his mind.At his birthday press conference in 1937, Tesla was asked about his weapon, and he made the claim, But it is not an experiment... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world. At the 1940 birthday press conference, 84 year old Tesla offered to develop his weapon for the US, but there was no interest in his offer.

            "text": "Tesla Lightning in His Hand is a large scale opera about Serbian American engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla , composed by Constantine Koukias, a Tasmanian composer and opera director of Greek ancestry based in Amsterdam, where he is known by his Greek name of Konstantin Koukias, with libretto by Marianne Fisher.  Plot The opera depicts Tesla's life as a series of reversals of fortunes. The two hour work, sung in English, is in two parts and features a bass, a tenor, a bass baritone, two sopranos, seven musicians and a large male choir. Also audible are clattering typewriters, pigeons , Morse code and fragments of Anton n Dvo k's New World Symphony. It also included two Tesla coil as props at its premiere. A warning was issued in the program to audience members who might be wearing pace makers, hearing aides, or any form of electric, magnetic, mechanical or metallic implant or prosthetic device .  Production The full opera was produced in 2003 by IHOS Music Theatre and Opera. It was originally commissioned by the West Australian Opera and developed over three years through two staged works in development . Creator and original Artistic Director of Tasmania's 10 Days on the Island Festival, Robyn Archer, commissioned the full opera to open the festival in 2003. The work, sponsored by the John Holland Group, was staged in a massive shed on Hobart's docks, where the Tesla coils put on a spectacular display of electron sparks .  Reception Reviewing the production for the Melbourne Age, David Lander described it as gorgeous image based performance art with a fascinating, brittle score in which dilemmas are ignored in favour of sensuality . Tesla was featured on ABC Classic FM's New Music Australia program and has been cited as far afield as Croatia, where it was noted in a tourist board tribute to the scientist and Croatian Post's web page detailing a stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the inventor's birth.  2003 production credits Production director: Werner Ihlenfeld Production designer: Maria Kunda Artist in light: Hugh McSpedden  References   External links Tasmanian Composers Collective listing for Constantine Koukias IHOS Music Theatre and Opera Tesla web page",

            "text": "Wireless power transfer , wireless power transmission, wireless energy transmission , or electromagnetic power transfer is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, a transmitter device, driven by electric power from a power source, generates a time varying electromagnetic field, which transmits power across space to a receiver device, which extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load. The technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thus increasing the mobility, convenience, and safety of an electronic device for all users. Wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible. Wireless power techniques mainly fall into two categories, near field and far field. In near field or non radiative techniques, power is transferred over short distances by magnetic fields using inductive coupling between coils of wire, or by electric fields using capacitive coupling between metal electrodes. Inductive coupling is the most widely used wireless technology; its applications include charging handheld devices like phones and electric toothbrushes, RFID tags, induction cooking, and wirelessly charging or continuous wireless power transfer in implantable medical devices like artificial cardiac pacemakers, or electric vehicles. In far field or radiative techniques, also called power beaming, power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation, like microwaves or laser beams. These techniques can transport energy longer distances but must be aimed at the receiver. Proposed applications for this type include solar power satellites and wireless powered drone aircraft.An important issue associated with all wireless power systems is limiting the exposure of people and other living beings to potentially injurious electromagnetic fields.  Overview  Wireless power transfer is a generic term for a number of different technologies for transmitting energy by means of electromagnetic fields. The technologies, listed in the table below, differ in the distance over which they can transfer power efficiently, whether the transmitter must be aimed at the receiver, and in the type of electromagnetic energy they use: time varying electric fields, magnetic fields, radio waves, microwaves, infrared or visible light waves.In general a wireless power system consists of a transmitter device connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, which converts the power to a time varying electromagnetic field, and one or more receiver devices which receive the power and convert it back to DC or AC electric current which is used by an electrical load. At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating electromagnetic field by some type of antenna device. The word antenna is used loosely here; it may be a coil of wire which generates a magnetic field, a metal plate which generates an electric field, an antenna which radiates radio waves, or a laser which generates light. A similar antenna or coupling device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current. An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the frequency, which determines the wavelength. Wireless power uses the same fields and waves as wireless communication devices like radio, another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in cellphones, radio and television broadcasting, and WiFi. In radio communication the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, as long as it is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly. In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver. In contrast, with wireless power transfer the amount of energy received is the important thing, so the efficiency is the more significant parameter. For this reason, wireless power technologies are likely to be more limited by distance than wireless communication technologies. Wireless power transfer may be used to power up wireless information transmitters or receivers. This type of communication is known as wireless powered communication . When the harvested power is used to supply the power of wireless information transmitters, the network is known as Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer ; whereas when it is used to supply the power of wireless information receivers, it is known as a Wireless Powered Communication Network .These are the different wireless power technologies:  Field regions Electric and magnetic fields are created by charged particles in matter such as electrons. A stationary charge creates an electrostatic field in the space around it. A steady current of charges creates a static magnetic field around it. The above fields contain energy, but cannot carry power because they are static. However time varying fields can carry power. Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an alternating current of electrons in a wire, create time varying electric and magnetic fields in the space around them. These fields can exert oscillating forces on the electrons in a receiving antenna , causing them to move back and forth. These represent alternating current which can be used to power a load. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields surrounding moving electric charges in an antenna device can be divided into two regions, depending on distance Drange from the antenna. The boundary between the regions is somewhat vaguely defined. The fields have different characteristics in these regions, and different technologies are used for transferring power: Near field or nonradiative region This means the area within about 1 wavelength of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and power can be transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling between coils of wire. These fields are not radiative, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no receiving device or absorbing material within their limited range to couple to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on the size and shape of the antenna devices, which are usually coils of wire. The fields, and thus the power transmitted, decrease exponentially with distance, so if the distance between the two antennas Drange is much larger than the diameter of the antennas Dant very little power will be received. Therefore, these techniques cannot be used for long range power transmission.Resonance, such as resonant inductive coupling, can increase the coupling between the antennas greatly, allowing efficient transmission at somewhat greater distances, although the fields still decrease exponentially. Therefore the range of near field devices is conventionally divided into two categories: Short range up to about one antenna diameter: Drange Dant. This is the range over which ordinary nonresonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power. Mid range up to 10 times the antenna diameter: Drange 10 Dant. This is the range over which resonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power.Far field or radiative region Beyond about 1 wavelength of the antenna, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna whether or not there is a receiver to absorb it. The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves , which is determined by the frequency:  c f. At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant  , very little power is radiated. Therefore the near field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. Antennas about the same size as the wavelength Dant  such as monopole or dipole antennas, radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions , so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it. Therefore, these can be used for short range, inefficient power transmission but not for long range transmission.However, unlike fields, electromagnetic radiation can be focused by reflection or refraction into beams. By using a high gain antenna or optical system which concentrates the radiation into a narrow beam aimed at the receiver, it can be used for long range power transmission. From the Rayleigh criterion, to produce the narrow beams necessary to focus a significant amount of the energy on a distant receiver, an antenna must be much larger than the wavelength of the waves used: Dant  c f. Practical beam power devices require wavelengths in the centimeter region or below, corresponding to frequencies above 1 GHz, in the microwave range or above.  Near field techniques At large relative distance, the near field components of electric and magnetic fields are approximately quasi static oscillating dipole fields. These fields decrease with the cube of distance: 3 Since power is proportional to the square of the field strength, the power transferred decreases as 6. or 60 dB per decade. In other words, if far apart, doubling the distance between the two antennas causes the power received to decrease by a factor of 26 64. As a result, inductive and capacitive coupling can only be used for short range power transfer, within a few times the diameter of the antenna device Dant. Unlike in a radiative system where the maximum radiation occurs when the dipole antennas are oriented transverse to the direction of propagation, with dipole fields the maximum coupling occurs when the dipoles are oriented longitudinally.  Inductive coupling  In inductive coupling , power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. The transmitter and receiver coils together form a transformer . An alternating current through the transmitter coil creates an oscillating magnetic field by Ampere's law. The magnetic field passes through the receiving coil , where it induces an alternating EMF by Faraday's law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at 50 60 Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.Inductive coupling is the oldest and most widely used wireless power technology, and virtually the only one so far which is used in commercial products. It is used in inductive charging stands for cordless appliances used in wet environments such as electric toothbrushes and shavers, to reduce the risk of electric shock. Another application area is transcutaneous recharging of biomedical prosthetic devices implanted in the human body, such as cardiac pacemakers and insulin pumps, to avoid having wires passing through the skin. It is also used to charge electric vehicles such as cars and to either charge or power transit vehicles like buses and trains.However the fastest growing use is wireless charging pads to recharge mobile and handheld wireless devices such as laptop and tablet computers, computer mouse, cellphones, digital media players, and video game controllers. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission provided its first certification for a wireless transmission charging system in December 2017.The power transferred increases with frequency and the mutual inductance       M     displaystyle M  between the coils, which depends on their geometry and the distance         D      range          displaystyle D text range  between them. A widely used figure of merit is the coupling coefficient       k          M                    L        1              L        2                 displaystyle k ; ;M sqrt L 1 L 2  . This dimensionless parameter is equal to the fraction of magnetic flux through the transmitter coil       L   1     displaystyle L1  that passes through the receiver coil       L   2     displaystyle L2  when L2 is open circuited. If the two coils are on the same axis and close together so all the magnetic flux from       L   1     displaystyle L1  passes through       L   2     displaystyle L2 ,       k     1     displaystyle k 1  and the link efficiency approaches 100 . The greater the separation between the coils, the more of the magnetic field from the first coil misses the second, and the lower       k     displaystyle k  and the link efficiency are, approaching zero at large separations. The link efficiency and power transferred is roughly proportional to         k      2          displaystyle k 2  . In order to achieve high efficiency, the coils must be very close together, a fraction of the coil diameter         D      ant          displaystyle D text ant  , usually within centimeters, with the coils' axes aligned. Wide, flat coil shapes are usually used, to increase coupling. Ferrite flux confinement cores can confine the magnetic fields, improving coupling and reducing interference to nearby electronics, but they are heavy and bulky so small wireless devices often use air core coils. Ordinary inductive coupling can only achieve high efficiency when the coils are very close together, usually adjacent. In most modern inductive systems resonant inductive coupling is used, in which the efficiency is increased by using resonant circuits. This can achieve high efficiencies at greater distances than nonresonant inductive coupling.   Resonant inductive coupling  Resonant inductive coupling is a form of inductive coupling in which power is transferred by magnetic fields between two resonant circuits , one in the transmitter and one in the receiver . Each resonant circuit consists of a coil of wire connected to a capacitor, or a self resonant coil or other resonator with internal capacitance. The two are tuned to resonate at the same resonant frequency. The resonance between the coils can greatly increase coupling and power transfer, analogously to the way a vibrating tuning fork can induce sympathetic vibration in a distant fork tuned to the same pitch. Nikola Tesla first discovered resonant coupling during his pioneering experiments in wireless power transfer around the turn of the 20th century, but the possibilities of using resonant coupling to increase transmission range has only recently been explored. In 2007 a team led by Marin Solja i at MIT used two coupled tuned circuits each made of a 25 cm self resonant coil of wire at 10 MHz to achieve the transmission of 60 W of power over a distance of 2 meters  at around 40 efficiency.The concept behind resonant inductive coupling systems is that high Q factor resonators exchange energy at a much higher rate than they lose energy due to internal damping. Therefore, by using resonance, the same amount of power can be transferred at greater distances, using the much weaker magnetic fields out in the peripheral regions of the near fields. Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter . This is called mid range transfer, in contrast to the short range of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent. Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.A drawback of resonant coupling theory is that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency of the system is no longer constant but splits into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak.Resonant technology is currently being widely incorporated in modern inductive wireless power systems. One of the possibilities envisioned for this technology is area wireless power coverage. A coil in the wall or ceiling of a room might be able to wirelessly power lights and mobile devices anywhere in the room, with reasonable efficiency. An environmental and economic benefit of wirelessly powering small devices such as clocks, radios, music players and remote controls is that it could drastically reduce the 6 billion batteries disposed of each year, a large source of toxic waste and groundwater contamination.  Capacitive coupling  Capacitive coupling also referred to as electric coupling, makes use of electric fields for the transmission of power between two electrodes forming a capacitance for the transfer of power. In capacitive coupling , the conjugate of inductive coupling, energy is transmitted by electric fields between electrodes such as metal plates. The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric. An alternating voltage generated by the transmitter is applied to the transmitting plate, and the oscillating electric field induces an alternating potential on the receiver plate by electrostatic induction, which causes an alternating current to flow in the load circuit. The amount of power transferred increases with the frequency the square of the voltage, and the capacitance between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and inversely proportional to the separation. Capacitive coupling has only been used practically in a few low power applications, because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous, and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious ozone production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to dielectric polarization. Intervening materials between or near the electrodes can absorb the energy, in the case of humans possibly causing excessive electromagnetic field exposure. However capacitive coupling has a few advantages over inductive coupling. The field is largely confined between the capacitor plates, reducing interference, which in inductive coupling requires heavy ferrite flux confinement cores. Also, alignment requirements between the transmitter and receiver are less critical. Capacitive coupling has recently been applied to charging battery powered portable devices as well as charging or continuous wireless power transfer in biomedical implants, and is being considered as a means of transferring power between substrate layers in integrated circuits.Two types of circuit have been used: Transverse design: In this type of circuit, there are two transmitter plates and two receiver plates. Each transmitter plate is coupled to a receiver plate. The transmitter oscillator drives the transmitter plates in opposite phase by a high alternating voltage, and the load is connected between the two receiver plates. The alternating electric fields induce opposite phase alternating potentials in the receiver plates, and this push pull action causes current to flow back and forth between the plates through the load. A disadvantage of this configuration for wireless charging is that the two plates in the receiving device must be aligned face to face with the charger plates for the device to work. Longitudinal design: In this type of circuit, the transmitter and receiver have only one active electrode, and either the ground or a large passive electrode serves as the return path for the current. The transmitter oscillator is connected between an active and a passive electrode. The load is also connected between an active and a passive electrode. The electric field produced by the transmitter induces alternating charge displacement in the load dipole through electrostatic induction.  Resonant capacitive coupling  Resonance can also be used with capacitive coupling to extend the range. At the turn of the 20th century, Nikola Tesla did the first experiments with both resonant inductive and capacitive coupling.  Electrodynamic Wireless Power Transfer  An electrodynamic wireless power transfer system utilizes a receiver with a mechanically resonating or rotating permanent magnet. When subjected to a time varying magnetic field, the mechanical motion of the resonating magnet is converted into electricity by one or more electromechanical transduction schemes . Compared to other WPT schemes, EWPT leverages low frequency magnetic fields , which safely pass through conductive media and have higher human field exposure limits , showing promise for potential use in wirelessly recharging biomedical implants. For EWPT devices having identical resonant frequencies, the magnitude of power transfer is entirely dependent on critical coupling coefficient, denoted by       k     displaystyle k , between the transmitter and receiver devices. For coupled resonators with same resonant frequencies, wireless power transfer between the transmitter and the receiver is spread over three regimes under coupled, critically coupled and over coupled regimes. As the critical coupling coefficient increases from an under coupled regime to the critical coupled regime, the optimum voltage gain curve grows in magnitude and peaks when       k        k      c    r    i    t          displaystyle k k crit  and then enters into the over coupled regime where       k        k      c    r    i    t          displaystyle k k crit  and the peak splits into two. This critical coupling coefficient is demonstrated to be a function of distance between the source and the receiver devices.  Magnetodynamic coupling  In this method, power is transmitted between two rotating armatures, one in the transmitter and one in the receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets on the armatures. The transmitter armature is turned either by or as the rotor of an electric motor, and its magnetic field exerts torque on the receiver armature, turning it. The magnetic field acts like a mechanical coupling between the armatures. The receiver armature produces power to drive the load, either by turning a separate electric generator or by using the receiver armature itself as the rotor in a generator. This device has been proposed as an alternative to inductive power transfer for noncontact charging of electric vehicles. A rotating armature embedded in a garage floor or curb would turn a receiver armature in the underside of the vehicle to charge its batteries. It is claimed that this technique can transfer power over distances of 10 to 15 cm with high efficiency, over 90 . Also, the low frequency stray magnetic fields produced by the rotating magnets produce less electromagnetic interference to nearby electronic devices than the high frequency magnetic fields produced by inductive coupling systems. A prototype system charging electric vehicles has been in operation at University of British Columbia since 2012. Other researchers, however, claim that the two energy conversions make the system less efficient than electrical systems like inductive coupling.  Zenneck Wave Transmission  A new kind of system using the Zenneck type waves was shown by Oruganti et al., where they demonstrated that it was possible to excite Zenneck wave type waves on flat metal air interfaces and transmit power across metal obstacles. Here the idea is to excite a localized charge oscillation at the metal air interface, the resulting modes propagate along the metal air interface.  Far field techniques Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often multiple kilometer ranges, where the distance is much greater than the diameter of the device . High directivity antennas or well collimated laser light produce a beam of energy that can be made to match the shape of the receiving area. The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction. In general, visible light and microwaves are the forms of electromagnetic radiation best suited to energy transfer. The dimensions of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths ; so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one. The Rayleigh limit , although originally applied to image resolution, can be viewed in reverse, and dictates that the irradiance of any electromagnetic wave will be reduced as the beam diverges over distance at a minimum rate inversely proportional to the aperture size. The larger the ratio of a transmitting antenna's aperture or laser's exit aperture to the wavelength of radiation, the more can the radiation be concentrated in a compact beam Microwave power beaming can be more efficient than lasers, and is less prone to atmospheric attenuation caused by dust or aerosols such as fog. Here, the power levels are calculated by combining the above parameters together, and adding in the gains and losses due to the antenna characteristics and the transparency and dispersion of the medium through which the radiation passes. That process is known as calculating a link budget.  Microwaves  Power transmission via radio waves can be made more directional, allowing longer distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A rectenna may be used to convert the microwave energy back into electricity. Rectenna conversion efficiencies exceeding 95 have been realized. Power beaming using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the beaming of power to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.Power beaming by microwaves has the difficulty that, for most space applications, the required aperture sizes are very large due to diffraction limiting antenna directionality. For example, the 1978 NASA study of solar power satellites required a 1 kilometre diameter transmitting antenna and a 10 kilometre diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at 2.45 GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although short wavelengths may have difficulties with atmospheric absorption and beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the thinned array curse , it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. For earthbound applications, a large area 10 km diameter receiving array allows large total power levels to be used while operating at the low power density suggested for human electromagnetic exposure safety. A human safe power density of 1 mW cm2 distributed across a 10 km diameter area corresponds to 750 megawatts total power level. This is the power level found in many modern electric power plants. For comparison, a solar PV farm of similar size might easily exceed 10,000 megawatts at best conditions during daytime. Following World War II, which saw the development of high power microwave emitters known as cavity magnetrons, the idea of using microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.Japanese researcher Hidetsugu Yagi also investigated wireless energy transmission using a directional array antenna that he designed. In February 1926, Yagi and his colleague Shintaro Uda published their first paper on the tuned high gain directional array now known as the Yagi antenna. While it did not prove to be particularly useful for power transmission, this beam antenna has been widely adopted throughout the broadcasting and wireless telecommunications industries due to its excellent performance characteristics.Wireless high power transmission using microwaves is well proven. Experiments in the tens of kilowatts have been performed at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California in 1975 and more recently at Grand Bassin on Reunion Island. These methods achieve distances on the order of a kilometer. Under experimental conditions, microwave conversion efficiency was measured to be around 54 across one meter.A change to 24 GHz has been suggested as microwave emitters similar to LEDs have been made with very high quantum efficiencies using negative resistance, i.e., Gunn or IMPATT diodes, and this would be viable for short range links. In 2013, inventor Hatem Zeine demonstrated how wireless power transmission using phased array antennas can deliver electrical power up to 30 feet. It uses the same radio frequencies as WiFi.In 2015, researchers at the University of Washington introduced power over Wi Fi, which trickle charges batteries and powered battery free cameras and temperature sensors using transmissions from Wi Fi routers. Wi Fi signals were shown to power battery free temperature and camera sensors at ranges of up to 20 feet. It was also shown that Wi Fi can be used to wirelessly trickle charge nickel metal hydride and lithium ion coin cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet. In 2017, the Federal Communication Commission certified the first mid field radio frequency transmitter of wireless power. In 2021 the FCC granted a license to a over the air wireless charging system that combines near field and far field methods by using a frequency of about 900 MHz. Due to the radiated power of about 1 W this system is intended for small IoT devices as various sensors, trackers, detectors and monitors.  Lasers  In the case of electromagnetic radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum , power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is received and concentrated onto photovoltaic cells . This mechanism is generally known as 'power beaming' because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.Advantages compared to other wireless methods are: Collimated monochromatic wavefront propagation allows narrow beam cross section area for transmission over large distances. As a result, there is little or no reduction in power when increasing the distance from the transmitter to the receiver. Compact size: solid state lasers fit into small products. No radio frequency interference to existing radio communication such as Wi Fi and cell phones. Access control: only receivers hit by the laser receive power.Drawbacks include: Laser radiation is hazardous. Without a proper safety mechanism, low power levels can blind humans and other animals. High power levels can kill through localized spot heating. Conversion between electricity and light is limited. Photovoltaic cells achieve a maximum of 40 50 efficiency. Atmospheric absorption, and absorption and scattering by clouds, fog, rain, etc., causes up to 100 losses. Requires a direct line of sight with the target. Laser 'powerbeaming' technology was explored in military weapons and aerospace applications. Also, it is applied for the powering of various kinds of sensors in industrial environments. Lately, it is developed for powering commercial and consumer electronics. Wireless energy transfer systems using lasers for consumer space have to satisfy laser safety requirements standardized under IEC 60825.The first wireless power system using lasers for consumer applications was demonstrated in 2018, capable of delivering power to stationary and moving devices across a room. This wireless power system complies with safety regulations according to IEC 60825 standard. It is also approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration .Other details include propagation, and the coherence and the range limitation problem.Geoffrey Landis is one of the pioneers of solar power satellites and laser based transfer of energy, especially for space and lunar missions. The demand for safe and frequent space missions has resulted in proposals for a laser powered space elevator.NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center has demonstrated a lightweight unmanned model plane powered by a laser beam. This proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of periodic recharging using a laser beam system. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a proof of concept of utilizing a dual wavelength laser to wirelessly charge portable devices or UAVs.  Atmospheric plasma channel coupling  In atmospheric plasma channel coupling, energy is transferred between two electrodes by electrical conduction through ionized air. When an electric field gradient exists between the two electrodes, exceeding 34 kilovolts per centimeter at sea level atmospheric pressure, an electric arc occurs. This atmospheric dielectric breakdown results in the flow of electric current along a random trajectory through an ionized plasma channel between the two electrodes. An example of this is natural lightning, where one electrode is a virtual point in a cloud and the other is a point on Earth. Laser Induced Plasma Channel research is presently underway using ultrafast lasers to artificially promote development of the plasma channel through the air, directing the electric arc, and guiding the current across a specific path in a controllable manner. The laser energy reduces the atmospheric dielectric breakdown voltage and the air is made less insulating by superheating, which lowers the density of the filament of air.This new process is being explored for use as a laser lightning rod and as a means to trigger lightning bolts from clouds for natural lightning channel studies, for artificial atmospheric propagation studies, as a substitute for conventional radio antennas, for applications associated with electric welding and machining, for diverting power from high voltage capacitor discharges, for directed energy weapon applications employing electrical conduction through a ground return path, and electronic jamming.  Energy harvesting  In the context of wireless power, energy harvesting, also called power harvesting or energy scavenging, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves from nearby electrical equipment, light, thermal energy , or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule , it can be adequate to run or recharge small micropower wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. This new technology is being developed to eliminate the need for battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.  History   19th century developments and dead ends  The 19th century saw many developments of theories, and counter theories on how electrical energy might be transmitted. In 1826, Andr Marie Amp re discovered a connection between current and magnets. Michael Faraday described in 1831 with his law of induction the electromotive force driving a current in a conductor loop by a time varying magnetic flux. Transmission of electrical energy without wires was observed by many inventors and experimenters, but lack of a coherent theory attributed these phenomena vaguely to electromagnetic induction. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell's equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the wireless carrier of electromagnetic energy. Around 1884 John Henry Poynting defined the Poynting vector and gave Poynting's theorem, which describe the flow of power across an area within electromagnetic radiation and allow for a correct analysis of wireless power transfer systems. This was followed on by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz' 1888 validation of the theory, which included the evidence for radio waves.During the same period two schemes of wireless signaling were put forward by William Henry Ward and Mahlon Loomis that were based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. Both inventors' patents noted this layer connected with a return path using Earth currents ' would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries, and could also be used for lighting, heat, and motive power. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear's 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.  Tesla  After 1890, inventor Nikola Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using spark excited radio frequency resonant transformers, now called Tesla coils, which generated high AC voltages. Early on he attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He found he could increase the distance at which he could light a lamp by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the transmitter's LC circuit. using resonant inductive coupling. Tesla failed to make a commercial product out of his findings but his resonant inductive coupling method is now widely used in electronics and is currently being applied to short range wireless power systems. Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would break the air stratum down , eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a World Wireless System that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.  Near field and non radiative technologies  Inductive power transfer between nearby wire coils was the earliest wireless power technology to be developed, existing since the transformer was developed in the 1800s. Induction heating has been used since the early 1900s and is used for induction cooking.With the advent of cordless devices, induction charging stands have been developed for appliances used in wet environments, like electric toothbrushes and electric razors, to eliminate the hazard of electric shock. One of the earliest proposed applications of inductive transfer was to power electric locomotives. In 1892 Maurice Hutin and Maurice Leblanc patented a wireless method of powering railroad trains using resonant coils inductively coupled to a track wire at 3 kHz.In the early 1960s resonant inductive wireless energy transfer was used successfully in implantable medical devices including such devices as pacemakers and artificial hearts. While the early systems used a resonant receiver coil, later systems implemented resonant transmitter coils as well. These medical devices are designed for high efficiency using low power electronics while efficiently accommodating some misalignment and dynamic twisting of the coils. The separation between the coils in implantable applications is commonly less than 20 cm. Today resonant inductive energy transfer is regularly used for providing electric power in many commercially available medical implantable devices.The first passive RFID technologies were invented by Mario Cardullo and Koelle et al. and by the 1990s were being used in proximity cards and contactless smartcards. The proliferation of portable wireless communication devices such as mobile phones, tablet, and laptop computers in recent decades is currently driving the development of mid range wireless powering and charging technology to eliminate the need for these devices to be tethered to wall plugs during charging. The Wireless Power Consortium was established in 2008 to develop interoperable standards across manufacturers. Its Qi inductive power standard published in August 2009 enables high efficiency charging and powering of portable devices of up to 5 watts over distances of 4 cm . The wireless device is placed on a flat charger plate and power is transferred from a flat coil in the charger to a similar one in the device. In 2007, a team led by Marin Solja i at MIT used a dual resonance transmitter with a 25 cm diameter secondary tuned to 10 MHz to transfer 60 W of power to a similar dual resonance receiver over a distance of 2 meters  at around 40 efficiency.In 2008 the team of Greg Leyh and Mike Kennan of Nevada Lightning Lab used a grounded dual resonance transmitter with a 57 cm diameter secondary tuned to 60 kHz and a similar grounded dual resonance receiver to transfer power through coupled electric fields with an earth current return circuit over a distance of 12 meters . In 2011, Dr. Christopher A. Tucker and Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading, recreated Tesla's 1900 patent 0,645,576 in miniature and demonstrated power transmission over 4 meters with a coil diameter of 10 centimetres at a resonant frequency of 27.50 MHz, with an effective efficiency of 60 .  Microwaves and lasers  Before World War II, little progress was made in wireless power transmission. Radio was developed for communication uses, but could not be used for power transmission since the relatively low frequency radio waves spread out in all directions and little energy reached the receiver. In radio communication, at the receiver, an amplifier intensifies a weak signal using energy from another source. For power transmission, efficient transmission required transmitters that could generate higher frequency microwaves, which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.The development of microwave technology during World War II, such as the klystron and magnetron tubes and parabolic antennas, made radiative methods practical for the first time, and the first long distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by William C. Brown. In 1964, Brown invented the rectenna which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground. A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 1980s was to develop a solar power satellite. Conceived in 1968 by Peter Glaser, this would harvest energy from sunlight using solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the electric power grid. In landmark 1975 experiments as technical director of a JPL Raytheon program, Brown demonstrated long range transmission by beaming 475 W of microwave power to a rectenna a mile away, with a microwave to DC conversion efficiency of 54 . At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he and Robert Dickinson transmitted 30 kW DC output power across 1.5 km with 2.38 GHz microwaves from a 26 m dish to a 7.3 x 3.5 m rectenna array. The incident RF to DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna was 80 . In 1983 Japan launched Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction Experiment , a rocket experiment to test transmission of high power microwaves through the ionosphere.In recent years a focus of research has been the development of wireless powered drone aircraft, which began in 1959 with the Dept. of Defense's RAMP project which sponsored Brown's research. In 1987 Canada's Communications Research Center developed a small prototype airplane called Stationary High Altitude Relay Platform to relay telecommunication data between points on earth similar to a communications satellite. Powered by a rectenna, it could fly at 13 miles altitude and stay aloft for months. In 1992 a team at Kyoto University built a more advanced craft called MILAX . In 2003 NASA flew the first laser powered aircraft. The small model plane's motor was powered by electricity generated by photocells from a beam of infrared light from a ground based laser, while a control system kept the laser pointed at the plane.

            "text": "Tesla's electro mechanical oscillator is a steam powered electric generator patented by Nikola Tesla in 1893. Later in life Tesla claimed one version of the oscillator caused an earthquake in New York City in 1898, gaining it the popular culture title Tesla's earthquake machine .  Description Tesla's oscillator is a reciprocating electricity generator. Steam would be forced into the oscillator, and exit through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature, causing it to vibrate up and down at high speed, producing electricity. The casing's upper chamber had to withstand pressures of 400 psi and temperatures exceeding 200 C. Some versions used air trapped behind the piston as an air spring , increasing efficiency. Another variation used electromagnets to control the frequency of the piston's oscillation. Tesla developed many versions of the oscillator and looked on it as a possible replacement for inefficient reciprocating steam engines used to turn generators, but it was superseded by the development of highly efficient steam turbines. Tesla also used the highly regular tunable oscillation of the device to set frequency in his high frequency electrical and wireless transmission experiments. There are also claims it had a physiological effect on people subjected to its vibrations in that it acted as a laxative causing people to immediately run to the bathroom afterwards.  Earthquake claims In 1935 at his annual birthday party press meeting a 79 year old Tesla related a story where he claimed a version of his mechanical oscillator caused extreme vibrations in structures and even an earthquake in downtown New York City. Reporter John J. O'Neill's biography of Nikola Tesla includes a version of this story .One version of the story has Tesla experimenting with a small version of his mechanical oscillator at his laboratory on 46 East Houston Street near the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo. Tesla said the oscillator was around 7 inches long and weighing 1 or 2 pounds , something you could put in your overcoat pocket . At one point while experimenting with the oscillator, he alleged it generated a resonance in several buildings, causing complaints to the police. As the speed grew, he said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledgehammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived. Other versions have Tesla smashing the device before the police arrive and have multi ton equipment in the basement moving around. Another version has Tesla clamping an oscillator to a building under construction and causing it to vibrate so violently the steelworkers working on it left the building in a panic.At the 1935 party Tesla also claimed the mechanical oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with Five pounds of air pressure if attached on a girder and that he expected to earn 100 million from the oscillator within two years.  MythBusters  The oscillator earthquake machine was explored in 2006 in Episode 60 Earthquake Machine . The MythBusters made a device powered by electricity rather than steam. It produced vibrations that could be felt hundreds of feet away, but no earthquake shaking on the bridge they attached to; they judged that the claim that the device produced an earthquake to be false .

            "text": "Colorado Springs Notes, 1899 1900  is a book compiled and edited by Aleksandar Marin i and Vojin Popovi detailing the work of Nikola Tesla at his experimental station in Colorado Springs at the turn of the 20th century.  Preface Tesla's notes at the Colorado Springs experimental station were unpublished until the release of this book. Arrangements through the Nikola Tesla Museum allowed Aleksandar Marin i to make commentaries on the notes. The Nikola Tesla Museum published the work to mark the 120th anniversary of Tesla's birth.  Introduction Tesla was focused in his research for the practical development of a system for wireless transmission of power and a utilization system. Tesla said, in On electricity , Electrical Review : In fact, progress in this field has given me fresh hope that I shall see the fulfillment of one of my fondest dreams; namely, the transmission of power from station to station without the employment of any connecting wires. Tesla went to Colorado Springs in mid May 1899 with the intent to research: Transmitters of great power. Individualization and isolating the energy transmission means. Laws of propagation of currents through the earth and the atmosphere.Tesla spent more than half his time researching transmitters. Tesla spent less than a quarter of his time researching delicate receivers and about a tenth of his time measuring the capacity of the vertical antenna. Also, Tesla spent a tenth of his time researching miscellaneous subjects. The authors notes J. R. Wait's comment on Tesla activity, From an historical standpoint, it is significant that the genius Nikola Tesla envisaged a world wide communication system using a huge spark gap transmitter located in Colorado Springs in 1899. A few years later he built a large facility in Long Island that he hoped would transmit signals to the Cornish coast of England. In addition, he proposed to use a modified version of the system to distribute power to all points of the globe .The authors note that no alterations have been made to the original which still contains certain minor errors; calculation errors which influence conclusions are noted. The authors also note the end of the book contains commentaries on the Diary with explanatory notes.  June 1 to January 7 The main content of the book is composed of notes written by Tesla between June 1, 1899 to January 7, 1900.

            "text": "Wardenclyffe Tower , also known as the Tesla Tower, was an early experimental wireless transmission station designed and built by Nikola Tesla on Long Island in 1901 1902, located in the village of Shoreham, New York. Tesla intended to transmit messages, telephony and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea based on his theories of using the Earth to conduct the signals. His decision to scale up the facility and implement his ideas of wireless power transmission to better compete with Guglielmo Marconi's radio based telegraph system was met with refusal to fund the changes by the project's primary backer, financier J. P. Morgan. Additional investment could not be found, and the project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational. In an attempt to satisfy Tesla's debts, the tower was demolished for scrap in 1917 and the property taken in foreclosure in 1922. For 50 years, Wardenclyffe was a processing facility producing photography supplies. Many buildings were added to the site and the land it occupies has been trimmed down from 200 acres to 16 acres but the original, 94 by 94 ft , brick building designed by Stanford White remains standing to this day. In the 1980s and 2000s, hazardous waste from the photographic era was cleaned up, and the site was sold and cleared for new development. A grassroots campaign to save the site succeeded in purchasing the property in 2013, with plans to build a future museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla. In 2018 the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Design and operational principles   Origin  Tesla's design for Wardenclyffe grew out of his experiments beginning in the early 1890s. His primary goal in these experiments was to develop a new wireless power transmission system. He discarded the idea of using the newly discovered Hertzian waves, detected in 1888 by German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz since Tesla doubted they existed and basic physics told him, and most other scientists from that period, that they would only travel in straight lines the way visible light did, meaning they would travel straight out into space becoming hopelessly lost .In laboratory work and later large scale experiments at Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla developed his own ideas on how a worldwide wireless system would work. He theorized from these experiments that if he injected electric current into the Earth at just the right frequency he could harness what he believed was the planet's own electrical charge and cause it to resonate at a frequency that would be amplified in standing waves that could be tapped anywhere on the planet to run devices or, through modulation, carry a signal. His system was based more on 19th century ideas of electrical conduction and telegraphy instead of the newer theories of air borne electromagnetic waves, with an electrical charge being conducted through the ground and being returned through the air.Tesla's design used a concept of a charged conductive upper layer in the atmosphere, a theory dating back to an 1872 idea for a proposed wireless power system by Mahlon Loomis. Tesla not only believed that he could use this layer as his return path in his electrical conduction system, but that the power flowing through it would make it glow, providing night time lighting for cities and shipping lanes.In a February 1901 Collier's Weekly article titled Talking With Planets Tesla described his system of energy transmission and of telegraphy without the use of wires as: the Earth itself as the medium for conducting the currents, thus dispensing with wires and all other artificial conductors ... a machine which, to explain its operation in plain language, resembled a pump in its action, drawing electricity from the Earth and driving it back into the same at an enormous rate, thus creating ripples or disturbances which, spreading through the Earth as through a wire, could be detected at great distances by carefully attuned receiving circuits. In this manner I was able to transmit to a distance, not only feeble effects for the purposes of signaling, but considerable amounts of energy, and later discoveries I made convinced me that I shall ultimately succeed in conveying power without wires, for industrial purposes, with high economy, and to any distance, however great. Although Tesla demonstrated wireless power transmission at Colorado Springs, lighting electric lights mounted outside the building where he had his large experimental coil, he did not scientifically test his theories. He believed he had achieved Earth resonance which, according to his theory, would work at any distance.  Financing  Tesla was back in New York in January 1900. He had convinced his friend Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of The Century Magazine, to allow him to publish an article covering his work and Johnson had even sent a photographer to Colorado Springs the previous year to photograph Tesla's experiments. The article titled The Problem of Increasing Human Energy written by Tesla appeared in the June, 1900 edition of Century Magazine. Instead of the understandable scientific description Johnson had hoped for it was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise where Tesla described his futuristic ideas on harnessing the sun's energy, control of the weather with electricity, wireless control, and how future inventions would make war impossible. It also contained what were to become iconic images by photographer Dickenson Alley of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments. Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for his system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf Astoria's Palm Garden , The Players Club and Delmonico's. Tesla first went to his old friend George Westinghouse for help. Westinghouse seemed like a natural fit for the project given the large scale AC equipment Westinghouse manufactured and Tesla's need for similar equipment. Tesla asked Westinghouse to meet me on some fair terms in furnishing me the machinery, retaining the ownership of the same and interesting yourself to a certain extent . While Westinghouse declined to buy into the project, he did agree to lend Tesla 6,000. Westinghouse suggested Tesla pursue some of the rich venture capitalists. Tesla talked to John Jacob Astor, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and even sent a cabochon sapphire ring as a gift to Henry O. Havemeyer. No investment was forthcoming from Havemeyer and Ryan but Astor did buy 500 shares in Tesla's company. Tesla gained the attention of financier J. P. Morgan in November 1900. Morgan, who was impressed by Guglielmo Marconi's feat of sending reports from the America's Cup yacht races off Long Island back to New York City via radio based wireless the previous year, was dubious about the feasibility and patent priority of Tesla's system.In several discussions Tesla assured Morgan his system was superior to, and based on patents that superseded, that of Marconi and of other wireless inventors, and that it would far outpace the performance of its main competitor, the transatlantic telegraph cable. Morgan signed a contract with Tesla in March 1901, agreeing to give the inventor 150,000 to develop and build a wireless station on Long Island, New York, capable of sending wireless messages to London as well as ships at sea. The deal also included Morgan having a 51 interest in the company as well as a 51 share in present and future wireless patents developed from the project.  Design changes and financial problems  Tesla began working on his wireless station immediately. As soon as the contract was signed with Morgan in March 1901 he placed an order for generators and transformers with the Westinghouse Electric Company. Tesla's plans changed radically after he read a June 1901 Electrical Review article by Marconi titled Syntonic Wireless Telegraph .At this point Marconi was transmitting radio signals beyond the range most physicists thought possible and the description of the Italian inventor's use of a Tesla coil connected to the Earth led Tesla to believe Marconi was copying his earth resonance system to do it. Tesla, believing a small pilot system capable of sending Morse code yacht race results to Morgan in Europe would not be able to capture the attention of potential investors, decided to scale up his designs with a much more powerful transmitter, incorporating his ideas of advanced telephone and image transmission as well as his ideas of wireless power delivery. In July 1901 Tesla informed Morgan of his planned changes to the project and the need for much more money to build it. He explained the more grandiose plan as a way to leap ahead of competitors and secure much larger profits on the investment. With Tesla basically proposing a breach of contract, Morgan refused to lend additional funds and demanded an account of money already spent. Tesla would claim a few years later that funds were also running short because of Morgan's role in triggering the stock market panic of 1901, making everything Tesla had to buy much more expensive.Despite Morgan stating no additional funds would be supplied, Tesla continued on with the project. He explored the idea of building several small towers or a tower 300 feet and even 600 feet tall in order to transmit the type of low frequency long waves that Tesla thought were needed to resonate the Earth. His friend, architect Stanford White, who was working on designing structures for the project, calculated that a 600 foot tower would cost 450,000 and the idea had to be scrapped.  Plant at Wardenclyffe Tesla purchased 200 acres of land close to a railway line 65 miles from New York City in Shoreham on Long Island Sound from land developer James S. Warden who was building a resort community known as Wardenclyffe On Sound. Tesla would later state his plans were to eventually make Wardenclyffe a hub city in his plans for a worldwide system of 30 wireless plants, sending messages and media content and broadcasting electrical power. The land surrounding the Wardenclyffe plant was intended to be what Tesla would later in life refer to as a radio city with factories producing Tesla's patented devices. Warden expected to build housing on the part of his remaining land for the expected 2,000 2,500 Tesla employees. At the end of July 1901 Tesla closed a contract for the building of the wireless telegraph plant and electrical laboratory at Wardenclyffe. The final design Tesla started building at Wardenclyffe consisted of a wood framed tower 186 feet tall and the cupola 68 feet in diameter. It had a 55 ton steel hemispherical structure at the top . The structure was such as to allow each piece to be taken out and replaced as necessary. The main building occupied the rest of the facility grounds. Stanford White designed the Wardenclyffe facility main building. It included a laboratory area, instrumentation room, boiler room, generator room and machine shop. Inside the main building, there were electromechanical devices, electrical generators, electrical transformers, glass blowing equipment, X ray devices, Tesla coils, a remote controlled boat, cases with bulbs and tubes, wires, cables, a library, and an office. It was constructed in the style of the Italian Renaissance. The tower was designed by W.D. Crow, an associate of White. There was a great deal of construction under the tower to establish some form of ground connection but Tesla and his workers kept the public and the press away from the project so little is known. The descriptions include that the facility had a ten by twelve foot wood and steel lined shaft sunk into the ground 120 feet beneath the tower with a stairway inside it. Tesla stated that at the bottom of the shaft he had special machines rigged up which would push the iron pipe, one length after another, and I pushed these iron pipes, I think sixteen of them, three hundred feet, and then the current through these pipes takes hold of the earth. In Tesla's words the function of this was to have a grip on the earth so the whole of this globe can quiver. There is also contemporaneous and later descriptions of four 100 foot long tunnels, possibly brick lined and waterproofed, radiating from the bottom of the shaft north, south, east, and west terminating back at ground level in little brick igloos. Speculation on the tunnels ranges from them being for drainage, acting as access ways, or having the function of enhancing ground connection or resonance by interacting with the water table below the tower, maybe via being filled with salt water or liquid nitrogen.The Tesla biographer John Joseph O'Neill noted the cupola at the top of the 186 foot tower had a 5 foot hole in its top where ultraviolet lights were to be mounted, perhaps to create an ionized path up through the atmosphere that could conduct electricity. How Tesla intended to employ the ground conduction method and atmospheric method in Wardenclyffe's design is unknown. Power for the entire system was to be provided by a coal fired 200 kilowatt Westinghouse alternating current industrial generator. Construction began in September 1901 but money was so short Tesla complained in a letter to White he was facing foreclosure. Tesla kept writing Morgan letters pleading for more money and assuring the financier his wireless system would be superior to Marconi's, but in December Tesla's plans were dealt another serious blow when Marconi announced to the world he was able to send a wireless transmission across the Atlantic. Construction at Wardenclyffe continued through 1902 and in June of that year Tesla began moving his laboratory operations from 46 East Houston Street laboratory to the 94 foot square brick building at Wardenclyffe. By the end of 1902 the tower reached full height of 187 feet. What Tesla was up to at Wardenclyffe and the site itself was generally kept from the public. Tesla would respond to reporters inquiries stating there was a similar wireless plant in Scotland and that We have been sending wireless messages for long distances from this station for some time, but whether we are going into the telegraph field on a commercial basis I cannot say at present. Tesla continued to write to Morgan asking the investor to reconsider his position on the contract and invest the additional funds the project needed. In a July 3, 1903 letter Tesla wrote Will you help me or let my great work almost complete go to pots? Morgan's reply on July 14 was I have received your letter and in reply would say that I should not feel disposed at present to make any further advances . The night of Morgan's reply, and several nights after, newspapers reported that the Wardenclyffe tower came alive shooting off bright flashes lighting up the night sky. No explanation was forthcoming from Tesla or any of his workers as to the meaning of the display and Wardenclyffe never seemed to operate again. Tesla's finances continued to unravel. Investor money on Wall Street was continuing to flow to Marconi's system, which was making regular transmissions, and doing it with equipment far less expensive than the wireless plant Tesla was attempting to build. Some in the press began turning against Tesla's project claiming it was a hoax and the fall 1903 rich man's panic on Wall Street dried up investment further. Some money came from Thomas Fortune Ryan but the funds went towards the debt on the project instead of funding any further construction. Investors seemed to be shying away from putting money into a project that J. P. Morgan had abandoned. Tesla continued to write Morgan trying to get extra funding stating his knowledge and ability if applied effectively would advance the world a century . Morgan would only reply through his secretary saying it will be impossible for me Morgan to do anything in the matter . Tesla's attempts to raise money by getting the US Navy interested in his remote control boat torpedo and other attempts to commercialize his inventions went nowhere. In May 1905, Tesla's patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a further severe reduction of funding to the Wardenclyffe Tower. In an attempt to find alternative funding Tesla advertised the services of the Wardenclyffe facility but he was met with little success.  Abandonment  In 1906 the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. In June architect Stanford White was murdered by Harry Kendall Thaw over White's affair with Thaw's wife, actress Evelyn Nesbit. In October long time investor William Rankine died of a heart attack. Things were so bad by the fall of that year George Scherff, Tesla's chief manager who had been supervising Wardenclyffe, had to leave to find other employment. The people living around Wardenclyffe noticed the Tesla plant seemed to have been abandoned without notice.In 1904 Tesla took out a mortgage on the Wardenclyffe property with George C. Boldt, proprietor of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, to cover Tesla's living expenses at the hotel. In 1908 Tesla procured a second mortgage from Boldt to further cover expenses. The facility was partially abandoned around 1911, and the tower structure deteriorated. Between 1912 and 1915, Tesla's finances unraveled, and when the funders wanted to know how they were going to recoup their investments, Tesla was unable to give satisfactory answers. The March 1, 1916 edition of the publication Export American Industries ran a story titled Tesla's Million Dollar Folly describing the abandoned Wardenclyffe site: There everything seemed left as for a day chairs, desks, and papers in businesslike array. The great wheels seemed only awaiting Monday life. But the magic word has not been spoken, and the spell still rests on the great plant. By mid 1917 the facility's main building was breached and vandalized.  Demolition  By 1915, Tesla's accumulated debt at the Waldorf Astoria was around 20,000 . When Tesla was unable to make any further payments on the mortgages, Boldt foreclosed on the Wardenclyffe property. Boldt failed to find any use for the property and finally decided to demolish the tower for scrap. On July 4, 1917, the Smiley Steel Company of New York began demolition of the tower by dynamiting it. The tower was knocked on a tilt by the initial explosion but it took until September to totally demolish it. The scrap value realized was 1750. Since this was during World War I a rumor spread, picked up by newspapers and other publications, that the tower was demolished on orders of the United States Government with claims German spies were using it as a radio transmitter or observation post, or that it was being used as a landmark for German submarines. Tesla was not pleased with what he saw as attacks on his patriotism via the rumors about Wardenclyffe, but since the original mortgages with Boldt as well as the foreclosure had been kept off the public record in order to hide his financial difficulties, Tesla was not able to reveal the real reason for the demolition.George Boldt decided to make the property available for sale. On April 20, 1922, Tesla lost an appeal of judgment on Boldt's foreclosure. This effectively locked Tesla out of any future development of the facility.  Post Tesla era In 1925, the property ownership was transferred to Walter L. Johnson of Brooklyn. On March 6, 1939, Plantacres, Inc. purchased the facility's land and subsequently leased it to Peerless Photo Products, Inc. AGFA Corporation bought the property from Peerless and used the site from 1969 to 1992 before closing the facility. The site has undergone a final cleanup of waste produced during its Photo Products era. The clean up was conducted under the scrutiny of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and paid for by AGFA. In 2009, AGFA put the property up for sale for 1,650,000. The main building remains standing to this day; AGFA advertised that the land can be delivered fully cleared and level. It says it spent 5 million through September 2008 cleaning up silver and cadmium. A non profit preservation organization supported by The Oatmeal purchased the land in 2013 with hopes to create a museum to Tesla there.  Landmarking  On February 14, 1967, the nonprofit public benefit corporation Brookhaven Town Historical Trust was established. It selected the Wardenclyffe facility to be designated as a historic site and as the first site to be preserved by the Trust on March 3, 1967. The Brookhaven Town Historic Trust was rescinded by resolution on February 1, 1972. There were never any appointments made after a legal opinion was received; it was never set up properly. On July 7, 1976, a plaque from Yugoslavia was installed by representatives from Brookhaven National Laboratory near the entrance of the building. It reads: The sign was stolen from the property in November 2009. An anonymous benefactor is offering a 2,000 reward if it is returned to the property.In 1976, an application was filed to nominate the main building for listing on the National Register of Historic Places . It failed to get approval. The Tesla Wardenclyffe Project, Inc. was established in 1994 for the purpose of seeking placement of the Wardenclyffe laboratory office building and the Tesla tower foundation on both the New York State and NRHP. Its mission is the preservation and adaptive reuse of Wardenclyffe, the century old laboratory of electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla located in Shoreham, Long Island, New York.In October 1994, a second application for formal nomination was filed. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation conducted inspections and determined the facility meets New York State criteria for historic designation. A second visit was made on February 25, 2009. The site cannot be registered until it is nominated by a willing owner. Designation of the structure as a National Landmark is awaiting completion of plant decommissioning activities by its present owner.  Museum  In August 2012, concerned about an apparent offer to purchase the site and develop it for commercial use, web cartoon The Oatmeal launched a fundraiser for the Tesla Science Center to raise 1.7 million in order to purchase the property, with the hope of eventually building a museum on the grounds.Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of The Oatmeal, collaborated in 2012 to honor the Father of the Electric Age , by preserving the Wardenclyffe facility as a science center and museum. They initiated the Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum fund raising campaign on the Indiegogo crowdfunding site, to raise funding to buy the Wardenclyffe property and restore the facility. The project reached its goal of raising 850,000 within a week, more than exceeded the requested amount, including a 33,333 donation from the producers of the Tesla film Fragments from Olympus The Vision of Nikola Tesla . The campaign also attracted donations from benefactors such as Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, Inc.The money raised within one week was enough to get a matching grant from the state of New York, allowing the project to be able to meet the seller's asking price of 1.6 million; the state had agreed to match donations up to half that amount. A total of 1.37 million was donated, the matching grant from the State of New York brings the total collected to over 2.2 million. The surplus will be used to fund the cleaning and restoration of the property. Tesla, Wardenclyffe and the museum fundraising effort will be the subject of a new documentary being produced called Tower to the People Tesla's Dream at Wardenclyffe Continues.On May 2, 2013, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe announced that they had purchased the 15.69 acre laboratory site from Agfa Corporation and will begin to raise about 10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of Tesla and his legacy. On May 13, 2014, The Oatmeal published a comic called What It's Like to Own a Model S, Part 2 , in which they requested a further donation of 8 million from Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk in order to propel the museum toward completion. The next day, Musk stated on Twitter that he would be happy to help. On July 10, 2014, during a 158th birthday celebration for Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site, it was announced that Musk would donate 1 million toward funding the museum, as well as having a Tesla Motors supercharging station installed onsite.The center plans to offer several programs, including science teacher associations, conferences, symposia, field trips, associations with science competitions, and other science programs. Planned permanent exhibits include a Tesla exhibit, exploratorium type exhibits, and a living museum. On September 23, 2013, the President of Serbia, Tomislav Nikoli , unveiled a monument to Tesla at the Wardenclyffe site. Nikoli said that he had planned to push for the monument to be displayed at the United Nations, but chose Wardenclyffe once he learned it had been purchased for the center.  Facility grounds Wardenclyffe is located near the Shoreham Post Office and Shoreham Fire House on Route 25A in Shoreham, Long Island, New York. Wardenclyffe was divided into two main sections. The tower, which was located in the back, and the main building now compose the entire facility grounds. At one time the property was about 200 acres . Now it consists of slightly less than 16 acres .

            "text": "The Royal Order of St. Sava is an Order of merit, first awarded by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1883 and later by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was awarded to nationals and foreigners for meritorious achievements in the field of religion, education, science and the arts as well as for social and relief work. The order was abolished in 1945 with the proclamation of the People s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the end of the monarchy. It continues as a dynastic order, with appointments currently made by Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. An homonymous order was established in 1985, conferred by the Serbian Orthodox Church to ecclesiastic and secular persons with special merits.  History of the state order The Order of Saint Sava was established by Milan I of Serbia, four years after the country gained independence and its transformation from a principality into a kingdom in March 1882. It was first awarded in January 1883 to recognised civilians for meritorious achievements benefitting the Church, the arts and sciences, the royal house, and the state. In 1914, a change to the Order was made to allow soldiers of the Serbian Army who served with distinction to receive the honour, as well as to women for war merit and humanity The Order of St. Sava was thereafter awarded by the kings of Serbia and its successor Yugoslavia until the abolition of the monarchy in 1945.Five grades were awarded: Knight Grand Cross Knight Grand Officer Commander OfficerThe first grade was a jewel, worn with a sash over the shoulder and also with a breast star. The second and third grade laureates wore the Order on a neckband. The fourth grade was a medal with a triangular suspension, a rosette attached to the ribbon above the medal. The fifth grade had a triangular suspension without a rosette. The medals of the fourth and fifth grades were worn on the breast. All white ribbons had two light blue stripes.Several Order of St. Sava were bestowed to members of the British medical team during the First World War for humanity and gallantry performed under fire , after their volunteer medical units followed the Serbian army during the Great Retreat through the mountains of Albania.  History of the church order Since 1985, the Order has been awarded on the occasion of the 800th anniversary of St. Sava. This order is dedicated to ecclesiastic and secular persons, who have special merits for the Serbian Orthodox Church. According to the ordinance of the church, each person who received a medal of third grade may receive the medal of the higher grade as well as the first grade for future merits, provided that three years have passed at least since the previous award. The order is determined in three grades: the first one is white, the second red and the third blue coloured.

            "text": "Allis Chalmers was a U.S. manufacturer of machinery for various industries. Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company , Fraser Chalmers , the Gates Iron Works , and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company . It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis Chalmers Energy and AGCO.  History   Overview  Author photographer Randy Leffingwell aptly summarized the firm's origins and character. He observed that it grew by acquiring and consolidating the innovations of various smaller firms and building upon them; and he continued that Metal work and machinery were the common background. Financial successes and failures brought them together. Former marketing executive Walter M. Buescher said that Allis Chalmers was a conglomerate before the word was coined. Whether or not it is literally true that Allis Chalmers predated the sense of conglomerate meaning a widely diversified parent corporation, Buescher's point is valid: Allis Chalmers, despite its common theme of machinery, was an amalgamation of disparate business lines, each with a unique marketplace, beginning in an era when consolidations within industries were fashionable but those across industries were not yet common.  1800s to 1901  Edward P. Allis was an entrepreneur who in 1860 bought a bankrupt firm at a sheriff's auction, the Reliance Works of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had been owned by James Decker and Charles Seville. Decker Seville were millwrights who made equipment for flour milling. Under Allis's management, the firm was reinvigorated and began producing steam engines and other mill equipment just at the time that many sawmills and flour mills were converting to steam power. Although the financial panic of 1873 caught Edward Allis overextended and forced him into bankruptcy, his own reputation saved him and reorganization came quickly, forming the Edward P. Allis Company. Leffingwell said, He set out to hire known experts: George Hinkley, who perfected the band saw; William Gray, who revolutionized the flour milling process through roller milling; and Edwin Reynolds, who ran the Corliss Steam Engine works. Allis died in 1889, but under his sons and the other principals, the firm continued to prosper, and by 1900 it had grown to become one of America's largest steam engine builders. Thomas Chalmers was a Scottish immigrant to America who came to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour milling equipment. The Gates firm built the first steam operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country. In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps. By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment. Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement milling equipment. Another Scottish immigrant family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, they had organized a small machine shop and foundry in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 they were building boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors. By 1901 the principals of the Edward P. Allis, Fraser Chalmers, and Gates firms had decided to merge their companies. Edwin Reynolds believed Allis could control the industrial engine business. In May 1901 the Allis Chalmers Company was formed. It acquired Dickson's industrial engine business. Dickson's locomotive business was rolled into the new locomotive consolidation, the American Locomotive Company .  1901 1911  The managing director of the new company was Charles Allis, his brother William was chairman of the board, and William J. Chalmers was deputy managing director. Shortly after the merger was completed, a new factory was built in an area west of Milwaukee that was then known as North Greenfield. In 1902, with this new factory, the locale was renamed West Allis, Wisconsin. With the combining of the constituent firms, Allis Chalmers offered a wide array of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining; ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including skip cars, slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.In 1903, Allis Chalmers acquired the Bullock Electric Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, which added steam turbines to Allis Chalmers's powerplant equipment business line.  1912 1919  By 1912, the Allis Chalmers Company was in financial trouble, so it was reorganized. It was renamed the Allis Chalmers Manufacturing Company, and Otto Falk, a former Brigadier General of the Wisconsin National Guard, was appointed to turn it around. Falk pushed for new products and new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, which at the time was blossoming all over America. Allis Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10 18, the Model 6 12, and the Model 15 30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded.  1920s  As had also been true of the 1900 1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a favorable time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was also a time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18 30, the 12 20, the 15 25, and the United tractor Model U. Famed inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla spent the period 1919 1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis Chalmers.In 1926 Falk hired Harry Merritt, who would be a senior executive in Allis Chalmers's tractor business for many years. Merritt had worked in the sales and marketing of various brands of farm and construction equipment, most recently Holt, when Falk hired him away. Buescher, who worked under Merritt, credited Merritt with turning around Allis Chalmers's ailing farm equipment business and transforming it into the main profit center for the parent corporation. He said, Some say that General Falk pulled Harry Merritt into Milwaukee to liquidate the ailing tractor division. Others say that he was brought in to breathe new life into the moribund and unprofitable operation. Even if the first appraisal is correct, the second proved to be the way it turned out.  After Merritt's arrival, the profit picture changed. The farm equipment business proved to be a financial lifesaver for the corporation.  From next to nothing in 1927, Merritt saw the percentage of farm equipment business go to just short of sixty percent of corporate sales. Also in 1926, Allis Chalmers acquired Nordyke Marmon Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a maker of flour milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, a maker of electrical transformers. In 1928, Allis Chalmers acquired the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding a line of crawler tractors. In 1929, it acquired the La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him to think about the use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all red , Minneapolis Moline switched to Prairie Gold , and Case switched to Flambeau Red . John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow. In 1928, Henry Ford canceled U.S. production of the Fordson tractor. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons . Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, the onset of the Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis Chalmers Model U.  1930s  The 1930s were a pivotal decade. Despite the Great Depression, Allis Chalmers succeeded as demand for its machinery continued. In 1931, it acquired Advance Rumely of La Porte, Indiana, mostly because Merritt wanted the company's network of 24 branch houses and about 2,500 dealers, which would greatly increase Allis Chalmers's marketing and sales power in the farm equipment business. Also in 1931, the corporation's electrical equipment business expanded via acquisition when Brown, Boveri Cie, in a financial pinch because of the Depression, sold its U.S. electrical operations to Allis Chalmers. After 1931 Allis Chalmers was the licensee for U.S. sales of European products of Brown, Boveri Cie.In 1932, Allis Chalmers collaborated with Firestone to introduce pneumatic rubber tires to tractors. The innovation quickly spread industry wide, as it improved tractive force and fuel economy in the range of 10 to 20 . Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line. In 1933, Allis Chalmers introduced its Model WC, its first generation row crop tractor, which would become its highest selling tractor ever. In 1937, its lighter and more affordable second generation row crop, the Model B, arrived, and also became a top seller. Its All Crop Harvester was the market leader in pull type combine harvesters. In October 1937, Allis Chalmers was one of fourteen major electrical manufacturing companies that went to court to change the way labor unions excluded contractors and products in the building trades through the union use of the Men and Means Clause . The action of Allis Chalmers and others eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision of June 18, 1945, that ended certain union practices that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  1940s  World War II caused Allis Chalmers, like most other manufacturing companies, to become extremely busy. As happened with many firms, its civilian product lines experienced a period of being on hold , with emphasis on parts and service to keep existing machines running, but its war materiel production was pushed to the maximum of productivity and output. In the late 1930s through mid 1940s, Allis Chalmers made machinery for naval ships, such as Liberty ship steam engines, steam turbines, generators, and electric motors; artillery tractors and tractors for other army use; electrical switches and controls; and other products. Allis Chalmers was also one of many firms contracted to build equipment for the Manhattan Project. Its experience in mining and milling machinery made it a logical choice for uranium mining and processing equipment. Allis Chalmers ranked 45th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.Immediately at the war's end, in 1945 1946, Allis Chalmers endured a crippling 11 month labor strike. Buescher was convinced that the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike. This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s. But it certainly gave competitors a chance to grab market share. After WWII some companies refused to sell equipment to Japanese farmers. Allis Chalmers dealers did not hesitate to sell to these farmers so many farms to this day still have an Allis Chalmers tractor in Oregon. In 1948, the Model WC was improved with various new features and became the Model WD, another top seller. The WD was a milestone for the company. It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two clutch system. It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard. Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.  1950s  The 1950s were a time of great demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater capability from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive dieselization, from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines, because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis Chalmers for construction equipment business. The Buda Lanova models were re christened the Allis Chalmers Diesel engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating and expanding the line. In 1952, the company acquired Laplant Choate, which added various models of scrapers to its construction equipment line. In 1953, the WD 45 was introduced, replacing the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests. This was almost double the horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from the seat of the tractor. A Buda diesel powered WD 45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D series in 1957. In 1955, the company acquired Gleaner Manufacturing Company, which was an important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull type combines, with its All Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented the All Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis Chalmers' profit. Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition. In 1957, the Allis Chalmers D Series of tractors was introduced. It enjoyed great success over the next decade. In 1959, Allis Chalmers acquired the French company Vendeuvre. Also in 1959, it acquired Tractomotive Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois, which it had been partnering with as an auxiliary equipment supplier for at least a decade.In Haycraft's history of the construction equipment business , he expressed the view that Allis Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in house product development. In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway. Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition and the need for subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view. However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir, Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often does not pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.  1960s and 1970s  In 1960, the U.S. government uncovered an attempt to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including the largest in the industry , with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy electrical cartel was that it was a desperate attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.The D series continued to be successful in the 1960s. The factory installed turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower . In 1965, Allis Chalmers acquired Simplicity for its line of lawn and garden equipment. Also in that year, the nuclear reactor SAFARI 1, a research reactor built by Allis Chalmers, went into operation.In the 1960s, the farm equipment, construction equipment, and heavy electrical industries were not as profitable for Allis Chalmers as they had been in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega conglomerates like Ling Temco Vought, Gulf Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case. In 1960, Allis Chalmers built the first grate kiln ore pellet plant at the Humboldt mine in Michigan. The company eventually built about 50 such plants.In 1974, Allis Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA, which bought a 65 majority stake at the outset. The new company was called Fiat Allis. In May 1975, the company closed its 20 acre, 78 year old Pittsburgh North Side factory that employed close to 1,100 full time and produced both distribution and instrument control transformers.In 1977, to compete in the recently expanding market segment of compact diesel utility tractors , Allis Chalmers began importing Hinomoto tractors with Toyosha diesel engines from Japan. They were rebadged with the Allis Chalmers brand for U.S. sales. In 1978, a joint venture with Siemens, Siemens Allis, was formed, supplying electrical control equipment.  1980s and 1990s  The company began to struggle in the 1980s in a climate of rapid economic change. It was forced amid financial struggles to sell major business lines. In 1983, Allis Chalmers sold Simplicity, the lawn and garden equipment division, to the division's management.1985 was a year of great dissolution for Allis Chalmers the year when it folded three of its main business lines: The Fiat Allis joint venture in construction equipment, over which the firms' managements had long since had a falling out, ended when Fiat bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. It renamed the company Fiatallis. The Allis Chalmers farm equipment business line ended when Allis sold it to K H D of Germany, at the time the owner of Deutz Fahr. K H D renamed the business as Deutz Allis and discarded the Allis Chalmers 8000 Series tractors and Persian Orange branding in favor of spring green tractors built by White Farm Equipment with Deutz air cooled engines. The Siemens Allis joint venture in electrical controls ended when Siemens bought out Allis's remaining minority stake. Siemens then blended the company into the Siemens Energy and Automation division.In 1988, Allis Chalmers sold its American Air Filter filtration business for approximately 225 million to SnyderGeneral Corporation of Dallas, a leading global air quality control firm. In 1990, Deutz Allis was sold to its management and became Allis Gleaner Corporation . Tractors began selling under the AGCO Allis name and were again painted Persian Orange. The AGCO brand of orange tractors was produced until 2011 when AGCO announced that it was phasing out the brand.In 1998, what remained of the Allis Chalmers manufacturing businesses were divested, and in January 1999, the company officially closed its Milwaukee offices. The remaining service businesses became Allis Chalmers Energy in Houston, Texas.  Brand reuse, 2000 to present  In August 2008, Briggs Stratton announced that it would sell lawn tractors under the Allis Chalmers brand name.

Tractor models  In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15kW fuel cell tractor for Allis Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This was the first fuel cell powered vehicle. Potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte. The original AC fuel cell tractor is currently on display at the Smithsonian. Below is a gallery showcasing some of the models that Allis Chalmers produced throughout its history, most of which are painted in their distinctive orange paint.          Balers  The first model introduced in 1949 was called the Roto Baler and the fore runner of modern round balers, albeit with much smaller bales. The Roto Baler was built until the 1960s or 1970s. Allis Chalmers also built many small square baler models.  Combine Harvesters  Allis Chalmers originally developed their pull type all crop harvester as their solution for growers to harvest their crops beginning in 1933. In 1955, Allis Chalmers acquired the Gleaner Baldwin Gleaner Manufacturing Company and its line of self propelled combine harvesters.   Industrial Construction Equipment The company produced several lines of earth moving and construction equipment ranging from: Road graders Tracked bulldozers Tracked loaders Forklifts Others    Industrial and power house equipment Allis Chalmers marketed a full line of Industrial and Power House equipment, including turbo generators and medium voltage switchgear. In the 1920s through the 1960s AC Power House and Industrial equipment was competitive with industry giants like General Electric and Westinghouse. As early as the 1920s AC was manufacturing multi MVA hydro electric generators and turbines, many of which remain in service today . Allis Chalmers manufactured several lines of medium voltage switchgear, such as the HF and MA lines. The HF line competed with the General Electric AM Magneblast line of vertical lift medium voltage switchgear. The MA line was a competitor of the ITE HK line of horizontal racking medium voltage switchgear. Allis Chalmers produced a line of substation transformers, voltage regulators, and distribution transformers. Allis Chalmers, during the period 1930 1965 and beyond, manufactured and marketed an extensive line of ore crushing equipment for the mining industry In 1965, Allis Chalmers built Big Allis, or Ravenswood No. 3, the biggest generator in New York. It is located in Queens, and has an output of 1000 MW. It is operational today.    Lawn and outdoor machinery In the late 1960s and early 1970s AC expanded into lawn and out door equipment.  All terrain vehicles  AC made a line of 6 wheeled Amphibious ATV's called the Terra Tiger .  Fuel cell golf carts  In 1965, Allis Chalmers built hydrogen fueled fuel cell golf carts.

            "text": "The Trinity Chapel Complex, now better known as the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava is a historic Eastern Orthodox church at 15 West 25th Street between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The church building was constructed in 1850 55 and was designed by architect Richard Upjohn in English Gothic Revival style. It was built as one of several uptown chapels of the Trinity Church parish, but was sold to the Serbian Eastern Orthodox parish in 1942, re opening as the Cathedral of St. Sava in 1944. The church complex includes the Trinity Chapel School, now the cathedral's Parish House, which was built in 1860 and was designed by Jacob Wrey Mould, a polychromatic Victorian Gothic building which is Mould's only extant structure in New York City. Attached to the sanctuary itself is the Clergy House at 26 West 26th Street, which was built in 1866 and was designed by Richard Upjohn and his son Richard M. Upjohn.The chapel was designated a New York City landmark in 1968, and the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.Most of the church was destroyed in a four alarm fire on May 1, 2016. In June 2016 reports were circulating that the city of New York ordered that the remains of the structure be demolished, stating that the walls are too unstable to be allowed to stand. The Buildings Department quickly clarified that the inspection was not complete and they had not ordered the immediate demolition of the building and instead is working with the parish to stabilize the structure.  Architecture  The outside is made of heavy exterior blocks of the building were etched in a rough finish, accented with austere Gothic trim and details. The front fa ade sits on West 25th Street and faces south. It measures around 65 feet in width by roughly 100 feet in height. The fa ade is supported by four stone buttresses, framed by delicate stone turrets at the sides, and punctuated by a large rose window above the entrance.Prior to the fire that took place May 1, 2016, the church was known to have had one of the largest timber hammerbeam roofs in the City of New York.  History   Trinity Chapel  With the population of New York City moving ever northward up Manhattan island in the mid 19th century, Trinity Church, the center of Episcopalianism in the city, needed to provide for its uptown parishioners, especially in the increasingly sought after residential neighborhoods around Union and Madison Squares. The church's solution was to build a chapel, named Trinity Chapel, on West 25th Street just off of Madison Square as an uptown annex. The architect selected was Richard Upjohn, who designed the third and current version of Trinity Church, as well as the Church of the Ascension on Fifth Avenue and West 10th Street, as well as many other churches in the Gothic Revival mode in the northeast. The parish was a wealthy and influential one, and Trinity was the only one of Trinity Church's chapels which was capable of supporting itself without assistance from the home church. In 1865 in Trinity Episcopal Church the Orthodox Liturgy was held for the first time in American history. Among the congregants was writer Edith Wharton, who was married in the church in 1885. In 1892, the reredos and altar were redesigned by Frederick Clarke Withers.  Cathedral of St. Sava  By 1930, as the rich and influential continued their uptown migration, the neighborhood around Madison Square had seriously declined. The chapel was now located within the Tenderloin, the city's main entertainment and red light district, and the congregation had dwindled. A Serbian Orthodox congregation, founded in the 1930s, purchased the building in 1942, with assistance from various Serbian churches, and the building re opened in 1944 as a Serbian Orthodox cathedral dedicated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of the Serbs. The first pastor was Rev. Dushan Shoulkletovich. Peter II, the last king of Yugoslavia attended services here.Gradual changes were made to the sanctuary to make it more Eastern Orthodox in style. A hand carved oak iconostasis was added in 1962. The Byzantine, hand carved Iconostasis, brought from the Monastery of St. Naum in Ohrid, Yugoslavia, was placed in the cathedral and blessed.The Icons on the Iconostasis were written by Russian iconographer, Ivan Meljinkov.When a bomb went off near the church on September 4, 1966 destroying some of the stained glass, they were replaced with new ones commissioned in Byzantine style.Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Pavle visited St. Sava Cathedral in October 1992. This was the first time the New York Church community was visited by a Patriarch.Outside the church are busts of Bishop Nikolai Velimirovich, who was instrumental in founding the parish, helped to organize the Serbian Orthodox Church in America, and was in later years the luminary in residence at the cathedral; Nikola Tesla, the inventor and entrepreneur; and Michael Pupin, a physicist of Serbian heritage.Prior to the fire of May 1, 2016 around 4 million had been spent on renovations to the cathedral's roof, gutters, and its attached community center in the past decade. The church's ceiling was repainted during those renovations to depict a nighttime sky.  2016 fire On May 1, 2016, a massive fire occurred at the church, on the day Orthodox Christians were celebrating Easter, destroying most of the building. The four alarm fire started at 6:49 p.m. local time and was brought under control by 8:30 p.m. employing more than 170 firefighters overall.There was one minor injury.The stone walls of the cathedral remain standing, and have been deemed to be structurally sound and not currently in danger of collapsing. Church officials have indicated they will examine whether any part of the structure could be preserved.The parish house associated with the Chapel Complex was not harmed by fire.  Aftermath  St. Sava parishioners reunited a few blocks away the first Sunday after the fire at Gramercy Park's Episcopal Calvary St. George's Parish Church to worship.Church officials indicate there will be plans to rebuild at the current site. Offers of support, including a letter from Patriarch Bartholomew, have been shared with the parishioners of the church.Serbia's Foreign Minister Ivica Da i indicated that the City of New York would be asked through diplomatic channels to aid in the rebuilding of the church. He also indicated Prime Minister Aleksandar Vu i authorized him to say that the government will help rebuild the church, because it has great significance for the Serbian community and the Serbian spirit in New York. As of two days after the fire, the definitive cause of the fire had not been determined. Candles that had not been properly extinguished after an Easter service were identified as a likely cause, according to a spokesperson of the New York City Fire Department . A caretaker told fire marshals that he stowed the candles in a cardboard box under a piece of wooden furniture in a rear corner of the 161 year old church.Nearly a month after the fire FDNY spokesman Frank Gribbon indicated conclusively that, Fire marshals have ... determined that candles, which had not been completely extinguished, caused the fire. It was reported that the city has ordered the remains of the church demolished, calling them unstable. The Buildings Department quickly clarified that the inspection was not complete and they had not ordered the immediate demolition of the building. In August 2016 the parish announced that the Building Department ordered metal beams be used to shore up the walls and the building be covered with a waterproof canvas to keep it from being damaged further by the elements. The parish announced they anticipate that effort to be completed in September 2016.In May 2018 the parish filed a lawsuit against their insurer Church Mutual for 47M USD. The insurer's payment was 12.7M USD based on the 1945 purchase price and subsequent improvements. The church countered that the payment did not account for present day rebuilding costs will be approximately 60M USD. The parish and the insurer reached an undisclosed settlement in April 2019. Installation of the new roof over the nave was completed in July 2019. As of November 2019 steel I beams for the new floor were being installed as well as framing for the windows which will be fitted with temporary acrylic panels. An image captured in March 2020 showed that the building had been enclosed.

            "text": "A vacuum tube, electron tube, valve , or tube , is a device that controls electric current flow in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied. The type known as a thermionic tube or thermionic valve utilizes thermionic emission of electrons from a hot cathode for fundamental electronic functions such as signal amplification and current rectification. Non thermionic types such as a vacuum phototube, however, achieve electron emission through the photoelectric effect, and are used for such purposes as the detection of light intensities. In both types, the electrons are accelerated from the cathode to the anode by the electric field in the tube. The simplest vacuum tube, the diode , invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming, contains only a heated electron emitting cathode and an anode. Electrons can only flow in one direction through the device from the cathode to the anode. Adding one or more control grids within the tube allows the current between the cathode and anode to be controlled by the voltage on the grids.These devices became a key component of electronic circuits for the first half of the twentieth century. They were crucial to the development of radio, television, radar, sound recording and reproduction, long distance telephone networks, and analog and early digital computers. Although some applications had used earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter for radio or mechanical computers for computing, it was the invention of the thermionic vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical, and created the discipline of electronics.In the 1940s, the invention of semiconductor devices made it possible to produce solid state devices, which are smaller, more efficient, reliable, durable, safer, and more economical than thermionic tubes. Beginning in the mid 1960s, thermionic tubes were being replaced by the transistor. However, the cathode ray tube remained the basis for television monitors and oscilloscopes until the early 21st century. Thermionic tubes are still used in some applications, such as the magnetron used in microwave ovens, certain high frequency amplifiers, amplifiers for electric musical instruments such as guitars, as well as high end audio amplifiers, which many audio enthusiasts prefer for their warmer tube sound. Not all electronic circuit valves electron tubes are vacuum tubes. Gas filled tubes are similar devices, but containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.  Classifications  One classification of thermionic vacuum tubes is by the number of active electrodes. A device with two active elements is a diode, usually used for rectification. Devices with three elements are triodes used for amplification and switching. Additional electrodes create tetrodes, pentodes, and so forth, which have multiple additional functions made possible by the additional controllable electrodes. Other classifications are: by frequency range by power rating by cathode filament type and warm up time by characteristic curves design by application specialized parameters specialized functions tubes used to display information Tubes have different functions, such as cathode ray tubes which create a beam of electrons for display purposes in addition to more specialized functions such as electron microscopy and electron beam lithography. X ray tubes are also vacuum tubes. Phototubes and photomultipliers rely on electron flow through a vacuum, though in those cases electron emission from the cathode depends on energy from photons rather than thermionic emission. Since these sorts of vacuum tubes have functions other than electronic amplification and rectification they are described elsewhere.  Description  A vacuum tube consists of two or more electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight envelope. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass to metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input.: 580 The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid to anode capacitance, improved high frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections. The earliest vacuum tubes evolved from incandescent light bulbs, containing a filament sealed in an evacuated glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission, originally known as the Edison effect. A second electrode, the anode or plate, will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a diode, and is used for rectification. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode will convert alternating current to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore be used in a DC power supply, as a demodulator of amplitude modulated radio signals and for similar functions. Early tubes used the filament as the cathode; this is called a directly heated tube. Most modern tubes are indirectly heated by a heater element inside a metal tube that is the cathode. The heater is electrically isolated from the surrounding cathode and simply serves to heat the cathode sufficiently for thermionic emission of electrons. The electrical isolation allows all the tubes' heaters to be supplied from a common circuit while allowing the cathodes in different tubes to operate at different voltages. H. J. Round invented the indirectly heated tube around 1913.The filaments require constant and often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode and heat it; this can occur even in an idle amplifier due to the quiescent current necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water jacket. Klystrons and magnetrons often operate their anodes at ground potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode. Except for diodes, additional electrodes are positioned between the cathode and the plate . These electrodes are referred to as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass on their way to the plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, transforms the diode into a voltage controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field that repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts . The solid state device which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field effect transistor , although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.  History and development  The 19th century saw increasing research with evacuated tubes, such as the Geissler and Crookes tubes. The many scientists and inventors who experimented with such tubes include Thomas Edison, Eugen Goldstein, Nikola Tesla, and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf. With the exception of early light bulbs, such tubes were only used in scientific research or as novelties. The groundwork laid by these scientists and inventors, however, was critical to the development of subsequent vacuum tube technology. Although thermionic emission was originally reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie, it was Thomas Edison's apparently independent discovery of the phenomenon in 1883 that became well known. Although Edison was aware of the unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest concentrated on the sensitivity of the anode current to the current through the filament . It was years later that John Ambrose Fleming applied the rectifying property of the Edison effect to detection of radio signals, as an improvement over the magnetic detector.Amplification by vacuum tube became practical only with Lee de Forest's 1907 invention of the three terminal audion tube, a crude form of what was to become the triode. Being essentially the first electronic amplifier, such tubes were instrumental in long distance telephony and public address systems, and introduced a far superior and versatile technology for use in radio transmitters and receivers. The electronics revolution of the 20th century arguably began with the invention of the triode vacuum tube.  Diodes  At the end of the 19th century, radio or wireless technology was in an early stage of development and the Marconi Company was engaged in development and construction of radio communication systems. Guglielmo Marconi appointed English physicist John Ambrose Fleming as scientific advisor in 1899. Fleming had been engaged as scientific advisor to Edison Telephone , as scientific advisor at Edison Electric Light , and was also technical consultant to Edison Swan. One of Marconi's needs was for improvement of the detector. Marconi had developed a magnetic detector, which was less responsive to natural sources of radio frequency interference than the coherer, but the magnetic detector only provided an audio frequency signal to a telephone receiver. A reliable detector that could drive a printing instrument was needed. As a result of experiments conducted on Edison effect bulbs, Fleming developed a vacuum tube that he termed the oscillation valve because it passed current in only one direction. The cathode was a carbon lamp filament, heated by passing current through it, that produced thermionic emission of electrons. Electrons that had been emitted from the cathode were attracted to the plate when the plate was at a positive voltage with respect to the cathode. Electrons could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and not capable of thermionic emission of electrons. Fleming filed a patent for these tubes, assigned to the Marconi company, in the UK in November 1904 and this patent was issued in September 1905. Later known as the Fleming valve, the oscillation valve was developed for the purpose of rectifying radio frequency current as the detector component of radio receiver circuits.While offering no advantage over the electrical sensitivity of crystal detectors, the Fleming valve offered advantage, particularly in shipboard use, over the difficulty of adjustment of the crystal detector and the susceptibility of the crystal detector to being dislodged from adjustment by vibration or bumping.The first vacuum tube diodes designed for rectifier application in power supply circuits were introduced in April 1915 by Saul Dushman of General Electric.  Triodes  In the 19th century, telegraph and telephone engineers had recognized the need to extend the distance that signals could be transmitted. In 1906, Robert von Lieben filed for a patent for a cathode ray tube which used an external magnetic deflection coil and was intended for use as an amplifier in telephony equipment. This von Lieben magnetic deflection tube was not a successful amplifier, however, because of the power used by the deflection coil. Von Lieben would later make refinements to triode vacuum tubes. Lee de Forest is credited with inventing the triode tube in 1907 while experimenting to improve his original Audion. By placing an additional electrode between the filament and plate , he discovered the ability of the resulting device to amplify signals. As the voltage applied to the control grid was lowered from the cathode's voltage to somewhat more negative voltages, the amount of current from the filament to the plate would be reduced. The negative electrostatic field created by the grid in the vicinity of the cathode would inhibit the passage of emitted electrons and reduce the current to the plate. With the voltage of the grid less than that of the cathode, no direct current could pass from the cathode to the grid. Thus a change of voltage applied to the grid, requiring very little power input to the grid, could make a change in the plate current and could lead to a much larger voltage change at the plate; the result was voltage and power amplification. In 1908, de Forest was granted a patent for such a three electrode version of his original Audion for use as an electronic amplifier in radio communications. This eventually became known as the triode. De Forest's original device was made with conventional vacuum technology. The vacuum was not a hard vacuum but rather left a very small amount of residual gas. The physics behind the device's operation was also not settled. The residual gas would cause a blue glow when the plate voltage was high . In 1912, de Forest and John Stone Stone brought the Audion for demonstration to AT T's engineering department. Dr. Harold D. Arnold of AT T recognized that the blue glow was caused by ionized gas. Arnold recommended that AT T purchase the patent, and AT T followed his recommendation. Arnold developed high vacuum tubes which were tested in the summer of 1913 on AT T's long distance network. The high vacuum tubes could operate at high plate voltages without a blue glow. Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt significantly improved on the original triode design in 1914, while working on his sound on film process in Berlin, Germany. Tigerstedt's innovation was to make the electrodes concentric cylinders with the cathode at the centre, thus greatly increasing the collection of emitted electrons at the anode.Irving Langmuir at the General Electric research laboratory had improved Wolfgang Gaede's high vacuum diffusion pump and used it to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but de Forest and AT T successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent. Pliotrons were closely followed by the French type 'TM' and later the English type 'R' which were in widespread use by the allied military by 1916. Historically, vacuum levels in production vacuum tubes typically ranged from 10 Pa down to 10 nPa .The triode and its derivatives are transconductance devices, in which the controlling signal applied to the grid is a voltage, and the resulting amplified signal appearing at the anode is a current. Compare this to the behavior of the bipolar junction transistor, in which the controlling signal is a current and the output is also a current. For vacuum tubes, transconductance or mutual conductance is defined as the change in the plate cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid to cathode voltage, with a constant plate to cathode voltage. Typical values of gm for a small signal vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens. It is one of the three 'constants' of a vacuum tube, the other two being its gain and plate resistance Rp or Ra. The Van der Bijl equation defines their relationship as follows:         g      m                       R        p                 displaystyle g m mu over R p  The non linear operating characteristic of the triode caused early tube audio amplifiers to exhibit harmonic distortion at low volumes. Plotting plate current as a function of applied grid voltage, it was seen that there was a range of grid voltages for which the transfer characteristics were approximately linear. To use this range, a negative bias voltage had to be applied to the grid to position the DC operating point in the linear region. This was called the idle condition, and the plate current at this point the idle current . The controlling voltage was superimposed onto the bias voltage, resulting in a linear variation of plate current in response to positive and negative variation of the input voltage around that point. This concept is called grid bias. Many early radio sets had a third battery called the C battery . The C battery's positive terminal was connected to the cathode of the tubes and whose negative terminal supplied this bias voltage to the grids of the tubes. Later circuits, after tubes were made with heaters isolated from their cathodes, used cathode biasing, avoiding the need for a separate negative power supply. For cathode biasing, a relatively low value resistor is connected between the cathode and ground. This makes the cathode positive with respect to the grid, which is at ground potential for DC. However C batteries continued to be included in some equipment even when the A and B batteries had been replaced by power from the AC mains. That was possible because there was essentially no current draw on these batteries; they could thus last for many years without requiring replacement. When triodes were first used in radio transmitters and receivers, it was found that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited. This was due to the parasitic capacitance between the plate and the control grid , known as the Miller capacitance. Eventually the technique of neutralization was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed and led to the success of the Neutrodyne radio during the 1920s. However, neutralization required careful adjustment and proved unsatisfactory when used over a wide range of frequencies.  Tetrodes and pentodes  To combat the stability problems of the triode as a radio frequency amplifier due to grid to plate capacitance, the physicist Walter H. Schottky invented the tetrode or screen grid tube in 1919. He showed that the addition of an electrostatic shield between the control grid and the plate could solve the problem. This design was refined by Hull and Williams. The added grid became known as the screen grid or shield grid. The screen grid is operated at a positive voltage significantly less than the plate voltage and it is bypassed to ground with a capacitor of low impedance at the frequencies to be amplified. This arrangement substantially decouples the plate and the control grid, eliminating the need for neutralizing circuitry at medium wave broadcast frequencies. The screen grid also largely reduces the influence of the plate voltage on the space charge near the cathode, permitting the tetrode to produce greater voltage gain than the triode in amplifier circuits. While the amplification factors of typical triodes commonly range from below ten to around 100, tetrode amplification factors of 500 are common. Consequently, higher voltage gains from a single tube amplification stage became possible, reducing the number of tubes required. Screen grid tubes were put on the market in late 1927. However, the useful region of operation of the screen grid tube as an amplifier was limited to plate voltages greater than the screen grid voltage, due to secondary emission from the plate. In any tube, electrons strike the plate with sufficient energy to cause the emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re captured by the plate. But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid since it is also at a positive voltage, robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the tube. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons over a certain range of plate voltages, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the dynatron region or tetrode kink and is an example of negative resistance which can itself cause instability. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that screen current is increased, which may cause the screen to exceed its power rating. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance region of the plate characteristic was exploited with the dynatron oscillator circuit to produce a simple oscillator only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate. The dynatron oscillator operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the tunnel diode oscillator many years later. The dynatron region of the screen grid tube was eliminated by adding a grid between the screen grid and the plate to create the pentode. The suppressor grid of the pentode was usually connected to the cathode and its negative voltage relative to the anode repelled secondary electrons so that they would be collected by the anode instead of the screen grid. The term pentode means the tube has five electrodes. The pentode was invented in 1926 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen and became generally favored over the simple tetrode. Pentodes are made in two classes: those with the suppressor grid wired internally to the cathode and those with the suppressor grid wired to a separate pin for user access . An alternative solution for power applications is the beam tetrode or beam power tube, discussed below.  Multifunction and multisection tubes  Superheterodyne receivers require a local oscillator and mixer, combined in the function of a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as using a combination of a triode with a hexode and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include control grids and screen grids . Many designs use such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current adds to that of the incoming radio frequency signal. The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers, including the miniature tube version of the All American Five . Octodes, such as the 7A8, were rarely used in the United States, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage. To further reduce the cost and complexity of radio equipment, two separate structures can be combined in the bulb of a single multisection tube. An early example is the Loewe 3NF. This 1920s device has three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one tube socket, it was able to substantially undercut the competition, since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the United States, Cleartron briefly produced the Multivalve triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also has a single tube socket, but because it uses a four pin base, the additional element connections are made on a mezzanine platform at the top of the tube base. By 1940 multisection tubes had become commonplace. There were constraints, however, due to patents and other licensing considerations . Constraints due to the number of external pins often forced the functions to share some of those external connections such as their cathode connections . The RCA Type 55 is a double diode triode used as a detector, automatic gain control rectifier and audio preamplifier in early AC powered radios. These sets often include the 53 Dual Triode Audio Output. Another early type of multi section tube, the 6SN7, is a dual triode which performs the functions of two triode tubes while taking up half as much space and costing less. The 12AX7 is a dual high mu triode in a miniature enclosure, and became widely used in audio signal amplifiers, instruments, and guitar amplifiers. The introduction of the miniature tube base which can have 9 pins, more than previously available, allowed other multi section tubes to be introduced, such as the 6GH8 ECF82 triode pentode, quite popular in television receivers. The desire to include even more functions in one envelope resulted in the General Electric Compactron which has 12 pins. A typical example, the 6AG11, contains two triodes and two diodes.Some otherwise conventional tubes do not fall into standard categories; the 6AR8, 6JH8 and 6ME8 have several common grids, followed by a pair of beam deflection electrodes which deflected the current towards either of two anodes.They were sometimes known as the 'sheet beam' tubes and used in some color TV sets for color demodulation. The similar 7360 was popular as a balanced SSB modulator.  Beam power tubes  A beam power tube forms the electron stream from the cathode into multiple partially collimated beams to produce a low potential space charge region between the anode and screen grid to return anode secondary emission electrons to the anode when the anode potential is less than that of the screen grid. Formation of beams also reduces screen grid current. In some cylindrically symmetrical beam power tubes, the cathode is formed of narrow strips of emitting material that are aligned with the apertures of the control grid, reducing control grid current. This design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high power, high efficiency power tubes. Manufacturer's data sheets often use the terms beam pentode or beam power pentode instead of beam power tube, and use a pentode graphic symbol instead of a graphic symbol showing beam forming plates.Beam power tubes offer the advantages of a longer load line, less screen current, higher transconductance and lower third harmonic distortion than comparable power pentodes. Beam power tubes can be connected as triodes for improved audio tonal quality but in triode mode deliver significantly reduced power output.  Gas filled tubes  Gas filled tubes such as discharge tubes and cold cathode tubes are not hard vacuum tubes, though are always filled with gas at less than sea level atmospheric pressure. Types such as the voltage regulator tube and thyratron resemble hard vacuum tubes and fit in sockets designed for vacuum tubes. Their distinctive orange, red, or purple glow during operation indicates the presence of gas; electrons flowing in a vacuum do not produce light within that region. These types may still be referred to as electron tubes as they do perform electronic functions. High power rectifiers use mercury vapor to achieve a lower forward voltage drop than high vacuum tubes.  Miniature tubes  Early tubes used a metal or glass envelope atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique was developed to use an all glass construction with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This was used in the design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having seven or nine pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi fi amplifiers. However, the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.  Sub miniature tubes  Sub miniature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in consumer applications as hearing aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The acorn tube was also very small, as was the metal cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, about the size of a thimble. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high frequency operation; nuvistors were used in aircraft radio transceivers, UHF television tuners, and some HiFi FM radio tuners until replaced by high frequency capable transistors.  Improvements in construction and performance  The earliest vacuum tubes strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and were made by lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. de Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir led to the development of high vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200 C. The development of oxide coated filaments in the mid 1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat , which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.  Indirectly heated cathodes  The desire to power electronic equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty with respect to the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a power transformer introduced mains frequency hum into audio stages. The invention of the equipotential cathode reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC power transformer winding having a grounded center tap. A superior solution, and one which allowed each cathode to float at a different voltage, was that of the indirectly heated cathode: a cylinder of oxide coated nickel acted as an electron emitting cathode and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer electrically connected to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a heater , and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum. In the 1930s, indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes. Tubes designed for high gain audio applications may have twisted heater wires to cancel out stray electric fields, fields that could induce objectionable hum into the program material. Heaters may be energized with either alternating current or direct current . DC is often used where low hum is required.  Use in electronic computers  Vacuum tubes used as switches made electronic computing possible for the first time, but the cost and relatively short mean time to failure of tubes were limiting factors. The common wisdom was that valves which, like light bulbs, contained a hot glowing filament could never be used satisfactorily in large numbers, for they were unreliable, and in a large installation too many would fail in too short a time . Tommy Flowers, who later designed Colossus, discovered that, so long as valves were switched on and left on, they could operate reliably for very long periods, especially if their 'heaters' were run on a reduced current . In 1934 Flowers built a successful experimental installation using over 3,000 tubes in small independent modules; when a tube failed, it was possible to switch off one module and keep the others going, thereby reducing the risk of another tube failure being caused; this installation was accepted by the Post Office . Flowers was also a pioneer of using tubes as very fast electronic switches. Later work confirmed that tube unreliability was not as serious an issue as generally believed; the 1946 ENIAC, with over 17,000 tubes, had a tube failure on average every two days. The quality of the tubes was a factor, and the diversion of skilled people during the Second World War lowered the general quality of tubes. During the war Colossus was instrumental in breaking German codes. After the war, development continued with tube based computers including, military computers ENIAC and Whirlwind, the Ferranti Mark 1 , and UNIVAC I, also available commercially. Advances using subminiature tubes included the Jaincomp series of machines produced by the Jacobs Instrument Company of Bethesda, Maryland. Models such as its Jaincomp B employed just 300 such tubes in a desktop sized unit that offered performance to rival many of the then room sized machines.  Colossus  Flowers's Colossus and its successor Colossus Mk2 were built by the British during World War II to substantially speed up the task of breaking the German high level Lorenz encryption. Using about 1,500 vacuum tubes , Colossus replaced an earlier machine based on relay and switch logic . Colossus was able to break in a matter of hours messages that had previously taken several weeks; it was also much more reliable. Colossus was the first use of vacuum tubes working in concert on such a large scale for a single machine.  Whirlwind and special quality tubes  To meet the reliability requirements of the 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, special quality tubes with extended life, and a long lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced largely to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. The silicon forms barium orthosilicate at the interface between the nickel sleeve and the cathode barium oxide coating.: 301 This cathode interface is a high resistance layer which greatly reduces the cathode current when the tube is switched into conduction mode.: 224 Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy allowed the production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. High purity nickel tubing and cathode coatings free of materials such as silicates and aluminum that can reduce emissivity also contribute to long cathode life. The first such computer tube was Sylvania's 7AK7 pentode of 1948 .: 59 Computers were the first tube devices to run tubes at cutoff for quite extended periods of time. Running in cutoff with the heater on accelerates cathode poisoning and the output current of the tube will be greatly reduced when switched into conduction mode.: 224 The 7AK7 tubes improved the cathode poisoning problem, but that alone was insufficient to achieve the required reliability.: 60 Further measures included switching off the heater voltage when the tubes were not required to conduct for extended periods, turning on and off the heater voltage with a slow ramp to avoid thermal shock on the heater element,: 226 and stress testing the tubes during offline maintenance periods to bring on early failure of weak units.: 60 61 The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air defense computer system. By the late 1950s, it was routine for special quality small signal tubes to last for hundreds of thousands of hours if operated conservatively. This increased reliability also made mid cable amplifiers in submarine cables possible.  Heat generation and cooling  A considerable amount of heat is produced when tubes operate, from both the filament and the stream of electrons bombarding the plate. In power amplifiers, this source of heat is greater than cathode heating. A few types of tube permit operation with the anodes at a dull red heat; in other types, red heat indicates severe overload. The requirements for heat removal can significantly change the appearance of high power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still. Heat escapes the device by black body radiation from the anode as infrared radiation, and by convection of air over the tube envelope. Convection is not possible inside most tubes since the anode is surrounded by vacuum. Tubes which generate relatively little heat, such as the 1.4 volt filament directly heated tubes designed for use in battery powered equipment, often have shiny metal anodes. 1T4, 1R5 and 1A7 are examples. Gas filled tubes such as thyratrons may also use a shiny metal anode since the gas present inside the tube allows for heat convection from the anode to the glass enclosure. The anode is often treated to make its surface emit more infrared energy. High power amplifier tubes are designed with external anodes that can be cooled by convection, forced air or circulating water. The water cooled 80 kg, 1.25 MW 8974 is among the largest commercial tubes available today. In a water cooled tube, the anode voltage appears directly on the cooling water surface, thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator to prevent high voltage leakage through the cooling water to the radiator system. Water as usually supplied has ions that conduct electricity; deionized water, a good insulator, is required. Such systems usually have a built in water conductance monitor which will shut down the high tension supply if the conductance becomes too high. The screen grid may also generate considerable heat. Limits to screen grid dissipation, in addition to plate dissipation, are listed for power devices. If these are exceeded then tube failure is likely.  Tube packages  Most modern tubes have glass envelopes, but metal, fused quartz and ceramic have also been used. A first version of the 6L6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads, while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions. Metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2 kW dissipation. The nuvistor was a modern receiving tube using a very small metal and ceramic package. The internal elements of tubes have always been connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however, these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections at the base of the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage. High power tubes such as transmitting tubes have packages designed more to enhance heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope is also the anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150 kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water vapor cooling are used. The highest power tube currently available is the Eimac 4CM2500KG, a forced water cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts. By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.  Names The generic name thermionic valve used in the UK derives from the unidirectional current flow allowed by the earliest device, the thermionic diode emitting electrons from a heated filament, by analogy with a non return valve in a water pipe. The US names vacuum tube , electron tube , and thermionic tube all simply describe a tubular envelope which has been evacuated , has a heater and controls electron flow. In many cases, manufacturers and the military gave tubes designations that said nothing about their purpose . In the early days some manufacturers used proprietary names which might convey some information, but only about their products; the KT66 and KT88 were kinkless tetrodes . Later, consumer tubes were given names that conveyed some information, with the same name often used generically by several manufacturers. In the US, Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association designations comprise a number, followed by one or two letters, and a number. The first number is the heater voltage; the letters designate a particular tube but say nothing about its structure; and the final number is the total number of electrodes . For example, the 12AX7 is a double triode with a 12.6V heater . The AX has no meaning other than to designate this particular tube according to its characteristics. Similar, but not identical, tubes are the 12AD7, 12AE7...12AT7, 12AU7, 12AV7, 12AW7 , 12AY7, and the 12AZ7. A system widely used in Europe known as the Mullard Philips tube designation, also extended to transistors, uses a letter, followed by one or more further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current , the functions of all sections of the tube , the socket type , and the particular tube . For example, the ECC83 is a 6.3V double triode with a miniature base . In this system special quality tubes are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.  Special purpose tubes  Some special purpose tubes are constructed with particular gases in the envelope. For instance, voltage regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon, helium or neon, which will ionize at predictable voltages. The thyratron is a special purpose tube filled with low pressure gas or mercury vapor. Like vacuum tubes, it contains a hot cathode and an anode, but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode. When the control electrode starts conduction, the gas ionizes, after which the control electrode can no longer stop the current; the tube latches into conduction. Removing anode voltage lets the gas de ionize, restoring its non conductive state. Some thyratrons can carry large currents for their physical size. One example is the miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s jukeboxes as control switches for relays. A cold cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an ignitron; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern silicon controlled rectifiers, also called thyristors due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters. A specialized tube is the krytron, which is used for rapid high voltage switching. Krytrons are used to initiate the detonations used to set off a nuclear weapon; krytrons are heavily controlled at an international level. X ray tubes are used in medical imaging among other uses. X ray tubes used for continuous duty operation in fluoroscopy and CT imaging equipment may use a focused cathode and a rotating anode to dissipate the large amounts of heat thereby generated. These are housed in an oil filled aluminum housing to provide cooling. The photomultiplier tube is an extremely sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and secondary emission, rather than thermionic emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use photomultiplier tube arrays to detect low intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation. The Ignatron tube was used in resistance welding equipment in the early 1970s. The Ignatron had a cathode, anode and an igniter. The tube base was filled with mercury and the tube was used as a very high current switch. A large current potential was placed between the anode and cathode of the tube but was only permitted to conduct when the igniter in contact with the mercury had enough current to vaporize the mercury and complete the circuit. Because this was used in resistance welding there were two Ignatrons for the two phases of an AC circuit. Because of the mercury at the bottom of the tube they were extremely difficult to ship. These tubes were eventually replaced by SCRs .  Powering the tube   Batteries  Batteries provided the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets. Three different voltages were generally required, using three different batteries designated as the A, B, and C battery. The A battery or LT battery provided the filament voltage. Tube heaters were designed for single, double or triple cell lead acid batteries, giving nominal heater voltages of 2 V, 4 V or 6 V. In portable radios, dry batteries were sometimes used with 1.5 or 1 V heaters. Reducing filament consumption improved the life span of batteries. By 1955 towards the end of the tube era, tubes using only 50 mA down to as little as 10 mA for the heaters had been developed.The high voltage applied to the anode was provided by the B battery or the HT supply or battery. These were generally of dry cell construction and typically came in 22.5 , 45 , 67.5 , 90 , 120 or 135 volt versions. After the use of B batteries was phased out and rectified line power was employed to produce the high voltage needed by tubes' plates, the term B persisted in the US when referring to the high voltage source. Most of the rest of the English speaking world refers to this supply as just HT . Early sets used a grid bias battery or C battery which was connected to provide a negative voltage. Since no current flows through a tube's grid connection, these batteries had no current drain and lasted the longest, usually limited by their own shelf life. The supply from the grid bias battery was rarely, if ever, disconnected when the radio was otherwise switched off. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using cathode biasing, eliminating the need for a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode along with the development of resistor capacitor coupling which replaced earlier interstage transformers. The C battery for bias is a designation having no relation to the C cell battery size.  AC power  Battery replacement was a major operating cost for early radio receiver users. The development of the battery eliminator, and, in 1925, batteryless receivers operated by household power, reduced operating costs and contributed to the growing popularity of radio. A power supply using a transformer with several windings, one or more rectifiers , and large filter capacitors provided the required direct current voltages from the alternating current source. As a cost reduction measure, especially in high volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current and with a similar warm up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so called AC DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five. Where the mains voltage was in the 100 120 V range, this limited voltage proved suitable only for low power receivers. Television receivers either required a transformer or could use a voltage doubling circuit. Where 230 V nominal mains voltage was used, television receivers as well could dispense with a power transformer. Transformer less power supplies required safety precautions in their design to limit the shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an interlock tying the power cord to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A cheater cord was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed. To avoid the warm up delay, instant on television receivers passed a small heating current through their tubes even when the set was nominally off. At switch on, full heating current was provided and the set would play almost immediately.  Reliability  One reliability problem of tubes with oxide cathodes is the possibility that the cathode may slowly become poisoned by gas molecules from other elements in the tube, which reduce its ability to emit electrons. Trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate current runaway due to ionization of free gas molecules. Vacuum hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime. Depending on the material, temperature and construction, the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements. The resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break in a manner similar to incandescent lamp filaments, but rarely do, since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps. The heater's failure mode is typically a stress related fracture of the tungsten wire or at a weld point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered up in a step function. Low cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage equal to that of the line . Some receivers made before World War II had series string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes. Following World War II, tubes intended to be used in series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same warm up time. Earlier designs had quite different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode and warmed up more slowly than lower powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily operate with heater voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life. Another important reliability problem is caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These made it easy to construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes. When a vacuum tube is overloaded or operated past its design dissipation, its anode may glow red. In consumer equipment, a glowing plate is universally a sign of an overloaded tube. However, some large transmitting tubes are designed to operate with their anodes at red, orange, or in rare cases, white heat. Special quality versions of standard tubes were often made, designed for improved performance in some respect, such as a longer life cathode, low noise construction, mechanical ruggedness via ruggedized filaments, low microphony, for applications where the tube will spend much of its time cut off, etc. The only way to know the particular features of a special quality part is by reading the datasheet. Names may reflect the standard name , or be absolutely anything .The longest recorded valve life was earned by a Mazda AC P pentode valve in operation at the BBC's main Northern Ireland transmitter at Lisnagarvey. The valve was in service from 1935 until 1961 and had a recorded life of 232,592 hours. The BBC maintained meticulous records of their valves' lives with periodic returns to their central valve stores.  Vacuum  A vacuum tube needs an extremely high vacuum to avoid the consequences of generating positive ions within the tube. Residual gas atoms ionize when struck by an electron and can adversely affect the cathode, reducing emission. Larger amounts of residual gas can create a visible glow discharge between the tube electrodes and cause overheating of the electrodes, producing more gas, damaging the tube and possibly other components due to excess current. To avoid these effects, the residual pressure within the tube must be low enough that the mean free path of an electron is much longer than the size of the tube . Commercial vacuum tubes are evacuated at manufacture to about 0.000001 mmHg .To prevent gases from compromising the tube's vacuum, modern tubes are constructed with getters, which are usually metals that oxidize quickly, barium being the most common. For glass tubes, while the tube envelope is being evacuated, the internal parts except the getter are heated by RF induction heating to evolve any remaining gas from the metal parts. The tube is then sealed and the getter trough or pan, for flash getters, is heated to a high temperature, again by radio frequency induction heating, which causes the getter material to vaporize and react with any residual gas. The vapor is deposited on the inside of the glass envelope, leaving a silver colored metallic patch that continues to absorb small amounts of gas that may leak into the tube during its working life. Great care is taken with the valve design to ensure this material is not deposited on any of the working electrodes. If a tube develops a serious leak in the envelope, this deposit turns a white color as it reacts with atmospheric oxygen. Large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials, such as zirconium. Early gettered tubes used phosphorus based getters, and these tubes are easily identifiable, as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass. The use of phosphorus was short lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters. Unlike the barium getters, the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired. Getters act by chemically combining with residual or infiltrating gases, but are unable to counteract inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, orthicons, and image orthicons, comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified , and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, so there is no long term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.  Transmitting tubes  Large transmitting tubes have carbonized tungsten filaments containing a small trace of thorium. An extremely thin layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms diffuse to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end of life scenario for a thoriated tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of tungsten carbide and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end of life in a tube with this type of emitter. WAAY TV in Huntsville, Alabama achieved 163,000 hours of service from an Eimac external cavity klystron in the visual circuit of its transmitter; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube. It has been said that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid state circuits at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave service where solid state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid state power amplifiers up to approximately 15kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube based power amplifiers.  Receiving tubes  Cathodes in small receiving tubes are coated with a mixture of barium oxide and strontium oxide, sometimes with addition of calcium oxide or aluminium oxide. An electric heater is inserted into the cathode sleeve and insulated from it electrically by a coating of aluminum oxide. This complex construction causes barium and strontium atoms to diffuse to the surface of the cathode and emit electrons when heated to about 780 degrees Celsius.  Failure modes   Catastrophic failures  A catastrophic failure is one that suddenly makes the vacuum tube unusable. A crack in the glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; tube sockets must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high voltage arcing. Tube heaters may also fail without warning, especially if exposed to over voltage or as a result of manufacturing defects. Tube heaters do not normally fail by evaporation like lamp filaments since they operate at much lower temperature. The surge of inrush current when the heater is first energized causes stress in the heater and can be avoided by slowly warming the heaters, gradually increasing current with a NTC thermistor included in the circuit. Tubes intended for series string operation of the heaters across the supply have a specified controlled warm up time to avoid excess voltage on some heaters as others warm up. Directly heated filament type cathodes as used in battery operated tubes or some rectifiers may fail if the filament sags, causing internal arcing. Excess heater to cathode voltage in indirectly heated cathodes can break down the insulation between elements and destroy the heater. Arcing between tube elements can destroy the tube. An arc can be caused by applying voltage to the anode before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing excess current through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.Tube rectifiers have limited current capability and exceeding ratings will eventually destroy a tube.  Degenerative failures  Degenerative failures are those caused by the slow deterioration of performance over time. Overheating of internal parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, can result in trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A getter is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level of internal gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter is effective against many atmospheric gases but has no chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and cathode ray tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal to glass lead in seals are one possible infiltration site. Gas and ions within the tube contribute to grid current which can disturb operation of a vacuum tube circuit. Another effect of overheating is the slow deposit of metallic vapors on internal spacers, resulting in inter element leakage. Tubes on standby for long periods, with heater voltage applied, may develop high cathode interface resistance and display poor emission characteristics. This effect occurred especially in pulse and digital circuits, where tubes had no plate current flowing for extended times. Tubes designed specifically for this mode of operation were made. Cathode depletion is the loss of emission after thousands of hours of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television cathode ray tubes. Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.  Other failures  Vacuum tubes may develop defects in operation that make an individual tube unsuitable in a given device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from the ends of the heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small signal audio use, although unobjectionable for other purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results. Tube pins can develop non conducting or high resistance surface films due to heat or dirt. Pins can be cleaned to restore conductance.  Testing  Vacuum tubes can be tested outside of their circuitry using a vacuum tube tester.  Other vacuum tube devices Most small signal vacuum tube devices have been superseded by semiconductors, but some vacuum tube electronic devices are still in common use. The magnetron is the type of tube used in all microwave ovens. In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the vacuum tube still has reliability and cost advantages for high frequency RF power generation. Some tubes, such as magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, Carcinotrons, and klystrons, combine magnetic and electrostatic effects. These are efficient RF generators and still find use in radar, microwave ovens and industrial heating. Traveling wave tubes are very good amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites. High powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the UHF range.  Cathode ray tubes  The cathode ray tube is a vacuum tube used particularly for display purposes. Although there are still many televisions and computer monitors using cathode ray tubes, they are rapidly being replaced by flat panel displays whose quality has greatly improved even as their prices drop. This is also true of digital oscilloscopes , although traditional analog scopes continue to be produced, are economical, and preferred by many technicians. At one time many radios used magic eye tubes , a specialized sort of CRT used in place of a meter movement to indicate signal strength or input level in a tape recorder. A modern indicator device, the vacuum fluorescent display is also a sort of cathode ray tube.The X ray tube is a type of cathode ray tube that generates X rays when high voltage electrons hit the anode.Gyrotrons or vacuum masers, used to generate high power millimeter band waves, are magnetic vacuum tubes in which a small relativistic effect, due to the high voltage, is used for bunching the electrons. Gyrotrons can generate very high powers .,Free electron lasers, used to generate high power coherent light and even X rays, are highly relativistic vacuum tubes driven by high energy particle accelerators. Thus, these are sorts of cathode ray tubes.  Electron multipliers  A photomultiplier is a phototube whose sensitivity is greatly increased through the use of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid state photodetectors , the single photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation as an alternative to the Geiger M ller tube . Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication. For decades, electron tube designers tried to augment amplifying tubes with electron multipliers in order to increase gain, but these suffered from short life because the material used for the dynodes poisoned the tube's hot cathode. However, eventually, Philips of the Netherlands developed the EFP60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime and was used in at least one product, a laboratory pulse generator. By that time, however, transistors were rapidly improving, making such developments superfluous. One variant called a channel electron multiplier does not use individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The microchannel plate consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an image intensifier in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing. Tektronix made a high performance wideband oscilloscope CRT with a channel electron multiplier plate behind the phosphor layer. This plate was a bundled array of a huge number of short individual c.e.m. tubes that accepted a low current beam and intensified it to provide a display of practical brightness.  Vacuum tubes in the 21st century   Niche applications  Although vacuum tubes have been largely replaced by solid state devices in most amplifying, switching, and rectifying applications, there are certain exceptions. In addition to the special functions noted above, tubes still have some niche applications. In general, vacuum tubes are much less susceptible than corresponding solid state components to transient overvoltages, such as mains voltage surges or lightning, the electromagnetic pulse effect of nuclear explosions, or geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares. This property kept them in use for certain military applications long after more practical and less expensive solid state technology was available for the same applications, as for example with the MiG 25.Vacuum tubes are still practical alternatives to solid state devices in generating high power at radio frequencies in applications such as industrial radio frequency heating, particle accelerators, and broadcast transmitters. This is particularly true at microwave frequencies where such devices as the klystron and traveling wave tube provide amplification at power levels unattainable using current semiconductor devices. The household microwave oven uses a magnetron tube to efficiently generate hundreds of watts of microwave power. Solid state devices such as gallium nitride are promising replacements, but are very expensive and still in development. In military applications, a high power vacuum tube can generate a 10 100 megawatt signal that can burn out an unprotected receiver's frontend. Such devices are considered non nuclear electromagnetic weapons; they were introduced in the late 1990s by both the U.S. and Russia.  Audiophiles  Enough people prefer tube sound to make tube amplifiers commercially viable in three areas: musical instrument amplifiers, devices used in recording studios, and audiophile equipment.Many guitarists prefer using valve amplifiers to solid state models, often due to the way they tend to distort when overdriven. Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to distort the signal. Different circuits will distort the signal in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes. Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.  Displays   Cathode ray tube  The cathode ray tube was the dominant display technology for televisions and computer monitors at the start of the 21st century. However, rapid advances and falling prices of LCD flat panel technology soon took the place of CRTs in these devices. By 2010, most CRT production had ended.  Vacuum tubes using field electron emitters  In the early years of the 21st century there has been renewed interest in vacuum tubes, this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate, as in integrated circuit technology. This subject is now called vacuum nanoelectronics. The most common design uses a cold cathode in the form of a large area field electron source . With these devices, electrons are field emitted from a large number of closely spaced individual emission sites. Such integrated microtubes may find application in microwave devices including mobile phones, for Bluetooth and Wi Fi transmission, and in radar and satellite communication. As of 2012, they were being studied for possible applications in field emission display technology, but there were significant production problems.As of 2014, NASA's Ames Research Center was reported to be working on vacuum channel transistors produced using CMOS techniques.  Characteristics   Space charge of a vacuum tube  When a cathode is heated and reaches an operating temperature around 1050 Kelvin , free electrons are driven from its surface. These free electrons form a cloud in the empty space between the Cathode and the anode, known as the space charge. This space charge cloud supplies the electrons that create the current flow from the cathode to the anode. As electrons are drawn to the anode during the operation of the circuit, new electrons will boil off the cathode to replenish the space charge. The space charge is an example of an electric field.  Voltage Current characteristics of vacuum tube  All tubes with one or more control grids are controlled by an AC input voltage applied to the control grid, while the resulting amplified signal appears at the anode as a current. Due to the high voltage placed on the anode, a relatively small anode current can represent a considerable increase in energy over the value of the original signal voltage. The space charge electrons driven off the heated cathode are strongly attracted the positive anode. The control grid in a tube mediate this current flow by combining the small AC signal current with the grid's slightly negative value. When the signal sine wave is applied to the grid, it rides on this negative value, driving it both positive and negative as the AC signal wave changes. This relationship is shown with a set of Plate Characteristics curves, which visually display how the output current from the anode can be affected by a small input voltage applied on the grid , for any given voltage on the plate . Every tube has a unique set of such characteristic curves. The curves graphically relate the changes to the instantaneous plate current driven by a much smaller change in the grid to cathode voltage as the input signal varies. The V I characteristic depends upon the size and material of the plate and cathode. Express the ratio between voltage plate and plate current. V I curve Plate current, plate voltage characteristics DC plate resistance of the plate resistance of the path between anode and cathode of direct current AC plate resistance of the plate resistance of the path between anode and cathode of alternating current  Size of electrostatic field  Size of electrostatic field is the size between two or more plates in the tube.

            "text": "Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror is the fourth episode of the twelfth series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who, first broadcast on BBC One on 19 January 2020. It was written by Nina Metivier, and directed by Nida Manzoor. In 1903, the Thirteenth Doctor helps Nikola Tesla escape from being kidnapped by the Skithra aliens, along with the assistance of her companions Graham O'Brien , Ryan Sinclair , and Yasmin Khan . The episode was watched by 5.20 million viewers, and received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  At Niagara Falls in 1903, Nikola Tesla is unsuccessful in getting investors for his wireless power transmission system as it is seen as dangerous and crazy. After working late fixing his generator, he comes across a floating orb. Feeling endangered, he makes a run with his assistant, Dorothy Skerritt, as a cloaked figure shoots at them. The Doctor arrives in time to help them escape aboard a train headed to New York City, ditching their pursuer by detaching the carriage. In New York, the group finds protesters waiting outside Tesla's lab, having been goaded into fearing Tesla and his inventions by his competitor Thomas Edison. The Doctor identifies the orb as an Orb of Thassa designed to share knowledge, but repurposed for an unknown cause. After spotting a spy for Edison, the Doctor, Graham and Ryan visit Edison's workshop, suspecting him to be behind the attack on Tesla. The cloaked figure arrives at Edison's lab and fatally electrocutes everyone in the workshop before pursuing Edison. The group escapes and traps one of the creatures in a chemical ring of fire, but it escapes by teleportation. The Doctor tries to warn Tesla and Yaz back at his lab, but the two are captured and transported to an invisible alien ship above the city. The Queen of the Skithra demands they fix her ship. When Tesla refuses, the Queen threatens to kill Yaz, but the Doctor transports herself onto the ship just in time. She learns that the Skithra ship is just a collection of stolen parts from various species and the Skithra just use others to do their work for them. The Skithra also chose Tesla as their engineer because he was able to discover their signal while he had been working on his wireless power system. The Doctor transports herself, Tesla, and Yaz back to Tesla's Wardenclyffe lab. The Doctor warns the Queen to leave, but the Queen refuses, threatening to destroy Earth if Tesla is not handed over. While Tesla and the Doctor hook up the TARDIS to help power Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower, Graham, Ryan, Yaz, Dorothy and Edison ward off the invading scorpion like Skithra. The Tower activates, and electrical bolts shoot through the Skithra ship, forcing it to leave Earth. Yaz is disappointed that despite Tesla's heroics, his reputation in the future remained unchanged, but the Doctor reminds her that Tesla's vision for a wireless world will still come to pass.  Production   Development  Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror was written by Nina Metivier, who had worked as a script editor on the previous series.  Casting  Robert Glenister and Goran Vi nji were cast, as Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla respectively. Glenister previously appeared on Doctor Who as the android Salateen in the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani. Anjli Mohindra, who had previously portrayed Rani Chandra in the Doctor Who spin off The Sarah Jane Adventures, played Queen Skithra. Further cast members were announced in Doctor Who Magazine 547 in early January 2020.  Filming  Nida Manzoor directed the third block, consisting of the fourth and fifth episodes. The sets for 1903 New York City were located at Nu Boyana Film Studios in Sofia, Bulgaria.  Promotion  The trailer for the episode was released after the broadcast of the previous episode, Orphan 55 .  Broadcast and reception   Television  Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror aired on 19 January 2020.  Ratings  Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror was watched by 4.04 million viewers overnight, making it the sixth most watched programme for the day in the United Kingdom. The episode had an Audience Appreciation Index score of 79. The episode received an official total of 5.20 million viewers across all UK channels.  Critical reception  The episode holds an approval rating of 89 on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 7 10 based on 18 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, If a tad light on meaning, Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror is still an enjoyable historical romp that benefits greatly from Jodie Whittaker and guest star Goran Vi nji 's crackling chemistry.

            "text": "Hotel Marguery was the first of three buildings located at 270 Park Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It was a six building apartment hotel complex built in 1917 as part of Terminal City. It was demolished in 1957 to make way for the Union Carbide Building.  Hotel and residences  After the construction of Grand Central Terminal in 1913, the newly fashionable Terminal City area north of the terminal was ripe for investment. Developer Dr. Charles V. Paterno built what was called the largest apartment building in the world with two distinct sections. The mansion like apartments that took the address 270 Park Avenue, and the apartment hotel that used the name Hotel Marguery on Madison Avenue. The residents would share a 70 by 275 foot garden with a private drive. As the restrained brick and stone structure rose, Manhattan millionaires rushed to take apartments. The 6 building complex which formed the 12 story, stone clad Renaissance Revival Hotel Marguery was built in 1917 by Dr. Paterno at a cost of more than 5 million. New York Central Railroad owned the land underneath the project since the construction of Grand Central Terminal. The buildings were centered around a 250 foot long Italian Garden which occupied the center of the block. When the building was first constructed, Vanderbilt Avenue passed through the center of the buildings where the garden was eventually built. After the street was closed, the hotel built a 60 feet tall carriage arch which allowed private access to the courtyard. The buildings contained 29 stores, 180 long term apartments, and 110 luxury suites which ranged from 6 to 16 rooms apiece. By the 1940s, the high end apartments rented for over 20,000 per month on average.On January 3, 1930, an explosion started a fire in the basement of the building which cut power and killed two people due to smoke inhalation. In 1933, the hotel's owners sued to reduce their property taxes significantly on the grounds that the property's assessed value was almost 5 million too high. After eight years in court, Justice Charles B. McLaughlin reduced the assessment in 1941 by an aggregate 19.588 million for the previous eight years, resulting in a refund of over 600,000 to the hotel's owners. In 1923, Nikola Tesla rented rooms at the Hotel Marguery. Harry Frazee, the owner of the Boston Red Sox who sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees, also lived here. In June 1945, a wealthy textile executive named Albert E. Langford was shot to death in the hallway outside of his apartment on the seventh floor of the Hotel Marguery. In September 1947, the NYPD busted an underground gambling ring in the hotel, arresting 11 men.  CBS and Time Inc. Plans for a replacement to the Hotel Marguery had first surfaced in 1944, when William Zeckendorf's Webb and Knapp planned a new 34 story structure. The building would have had a limestone facade with decorative vertical stainless steel columns. In 1945, CBS agreed to occupy the building but quickly backed out. Department store Wanamaker's also reportedly considered the site for an uptown location in addition to the main branch at Broadway and Ninth. Plans for the new structure faced a setback in 1946 when the Office of Price Administration denied Webb Knapp's petition to evict the 116 residents of the building.In the late 1940s, Time Inc. had an option to purchase the property and build a new headquarters for the company. The company planned a 39 story, 1 million square feet building designed by Harrison Abramovitz which was approved in June 1947, despite the protests of the hotel tenants. Time would have occupied 350,000 square feet of the space as its new world headquarters. At 23 million, the project was expected to be the largest private construction project in Manhattan since the end of World War II. Following the new tower's approval, the Marguery's tenants announced they would fight the decisions in the courts and through the city's Office of Rent Control. The tenants of the hotel hired New York prosecutor Peter McCoy as their attorney to oppose the destruction of the buildings. McCoy had previously prosecuted stockbrokers for the government before entering private practice. The tenants also appealed to the New York City Council to oppose the demolition. In 1948, the hotel closed as it had lost its luster and was reportedly heavily populated by ladies of the night and by gambling outfits. Due to the failure to evict the Marguery's tenants, Time gave up on the plans for a new tower in March 1950. Ultimately, Time instead moved to 1271 Avenue of the Americas at Rockefeller Center in 1958. By 1951, the Hotel Marguery's former Italian Gardens had been converted to a parking lot. The same year, Webb Knapp unveiled plans to spend 50 million to erect a 44 story, 580 feet tall office building on the site. The building would be topped by a 1,000 feet tall steel latticework observation tower, making the proposed building taller than the Empire State Building and the tallest building in New York City. The chemical company Union Carbide agreed to lease the site in August 1955 to serve as its world headquarters. At the time, the Marguery had been almost entirely converted from apartments into office suites. Some of the 250 tenants included Renault, Rheem Manufacturing Company, Georgia Pacific, Nedick's, Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, Airlines for America, The Manila Times, and the United Nations delegations for Mexico, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Venezuela. Demolition of the former hotel began in early 1957 and was completed by late August. The new building at 270 Park Avenue was completed in 1960.  In popular culture When the Hotel Marguery occupied 270 Park Avenue, the 1947 film noir Kiss of Death used it as one of several New York City locations.  References",

            "text": "The American Institute of Electrical Engineers was a United States based organization of electrical engineers that existed from 1884 through 1962. On January 1, 1963, it merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers .  History  The 1884 founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers included some of the most prominent inventors and innovators in the then new field of electrical engineering, among them Nikola Tesla, Thomas Alva Edison, Elihu Thomson, Edwin J. Houston, and Edward Weston. The purpose of the AIEE was stated to promote the Arts and Sciences connected with the production and utilization of electricity and the welfare of those employed in these Industries: by means of social intercourse, the reading and discussion of professional papers and the circulation by means of publication among members and associates of information thus obtained. The first president of AIEE was Norvin Green, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company. Other notable AIEE presidents were Alexander Graham Bell , Charles Proteus Steinmetz , Bion J. Arnold , Schuyler S. Wheeler , Dugald C. Jackson , Ralph D. Mershon , Michael I. Pupin , and Titus G. LeClair . The first technical meeting of the AIEE was held during the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . After several years of operating primarily in New York City, the AIEE authorized local sections in 1902. These were formed first in the United States and then in other countries . The AIEE's regional structure was soon complemented by a technical structure the first technical committee of AIEE being formed in 1903. Standardization work started in 1891 with the formation of a committee on units and standards, followed by a committee on standard wiring. The formation of the AIEE Subcommittee on Large Scale Computing in 1946 was considered a key milestone in the history of computer engineering. It was the first time that a professional association recognized the significance of computers and computing in electro technology. The early technical areas of interest of AIEE were electric power, lighting, and wired communications. Radio and wireless communications became the major focus of a rival organization, the Institute of Radio Engineers . The dynamic growth of radio technology and the emergence of the new discipline of electronics in the 1940s led to stiff competition between AIEE and IRE, with IRE showing faster growth in the 1950s and early 1960s, and attracting more students. In 1957, the IRE, with approximately 55,500 members, surpassed the AIEE in membership size; by 1962 the IRE had 96,500 members to the AIEE's 57,000.  Institute's first logo After the AIEE's founding in 1884, its member's badge was created in 1893 by a committee headed by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, President of AIEE from 1891 to 1892. The badge's logo depicted Benjamin Franklin's kite, representative of the discovery that lightning carried electricity. The design also showed a winding of gold wire with its midpoints crossed by a galvanometer's indicator, invoking the electrical engineer's Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, Ohm's law and the letters 'AIEE' were added in gold at the logo's base. The busy logo design was replaced four years later.  Merger and evolution The AIEE and the IRE merged in 1963 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , in short order becoming the world's largest technical society.

            "text": "John Stone Stone was an American mathematician, physicist and inventor. He initially worked in telephone research, followed by influential work developing early radio technology, where he was especially known for improvements in tuning. Despite his often advanced designs, the Stone Telegraph and Telephone Company failed in 1908, and he spent the remainder of his career as an engineering consultant.  Biography   Early years  Stone was born in Dover village, in Goochland County, Virginia, the son of Charles Pomeroy Stone, an American Civil War Union general and engineer, and Annie Jeannie Stone Stone. From 1870 until 1883, General Stone held the post of Chief of Staff to the khedive of Egypt, and, while growing up in Cairo, John Stone Stone became fluent in Arabic, French, German and Spanish in addition to English. His father tutored him in mathematics, and following the family's return to the United States, Stone attended Columbia Grammar Preparatory School in New York City, after which he studied civil engineering for two years at the Columbia University School of Mines, followed by two years at Johns Hopkins University, where he studied mathematics, physics and theoretical and applied electricity.  Telephone work  After completing his education, in 1890 he began working at the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, Massachusetts, in the experimental department of its Research and Development Laboratory. While there, drawing on the work of Oliver Heaviside, he made a rigorous mathematical analysis of the company's development of a long distance telephone link between New York and Chicago. His later work involved electrical resonance, which he initially investigated for its potential use in an automatic telephone exchange. In 1892, he attempted to wirelessly transmit audio using high frequency transmissions . This effort was unsuccessful, but the work proved applicable to the development of wired wireless transmissions over telephone lines, although his patent application was later ruled to have been anticipated by Major George O. Squier. In 1893, he developed a common battery system for telephone use, which provided, from a central location, the electric current needed to operate subscribers' phones. From 1896 to 1906 he also gave an annual short course of instruction in electrical resonance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to graduating classes in physics and electrical engineering.  Radio development  In 1899, Stone resigned from his telephone company position and began to work in Boston as an independent consulting engineer, although he was also retained by his former employer as a Consultant and Expert in patent causes . His first client was Herman W. Ladd, who was attempting to perfect his Telelocograph system for using radio signals as wireless lighthouses and for navigational direction finding. Ladd's approach turned out to be impractical, but the work gave Stone insight about the difficulties facing the embryonic technology of radiotelegraphic signalling, and he recognized that his earlier work on resonant circuits on telephone lines could be applied to improve radio transmitter and receiver designs. Moreover, unlike most other early radio experimenters, Stone had the mathematical background needed to fully analyze electrical circuits. In late 1900, the Stone Wireless Telegraphy Syndicate was started in Boston, with an initial funding of 10,000, to do experimental work in devising a commercial system. Stone used his knowledge of electrical tuning to develop a high selectivity approach to reduce the amount of interference caused by static and signals from other stations. Starting with Tesla style open core electrical transformers, he developed adjustable selective four circuit tuning that employed loose coupling to help insure that the transmitter and receiver were operating on a single common frequency. . He also took special care to mathematically analyze transmitter and receiver designs to increase efficiency and reduce losses. In early 1900, he applied for a U.S. patent for his tuning work, which was divided into three patents that were issued in 1901 and 1902. In mid 1902 the Stone Telegraph and Telephone Company, also based in Boston, was formed, in order to begin commercial operations. Stone acted as Chief Engineer, and two stations separated by sixteen kilometers were constructed at Cambridge and Lynn, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1905, demonstration radiotelegraph stations, using spark transmitters and electrolytic detectors, were installed for evaluation by the U.S. Navy. By the end of 1906, the government had purchased five ship and three land installations.The company's first commercial radiotelegraph link was between the Isle of Shoals and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which operated during the summer of 1905, replacing a failed Western Union telegraph cable. In 1907 Stone founded, and served as the president of, the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers , which was created as an educational resource for his company's employees. In 1906 the company tested a ship borne direction finder designed by Stone that, although fairly accurate, proved impractical as it required the entire ship to turn in order to take readings. Operating as a small independent concern, Stone found that he could not keep up with the advances in the industry, and in 1908 his company suspended operations, and was placed into receivership. Its assets, including its valuable portfolio of patents, were sold to Lee DeForest's Radio Telephone Company, for 10,000 cash and 300,000 of stock.In early 1911, he moved to New York City, once again working as a consultant. He also gained prominence as an independent expert, testifying in numerous radio patent cases. In 1912, he acted as an intermediary, making arrangements for Lee DeForest to demonstrate an early version of his three electrode audion vacuum tube to AT T engineers, who re engineered the device into an amplifier that was capable of establishing transcontinental telephone service. In 1914 1915 Stone served as president of the Institute of Radio Engineers.  Later life  In 1919 he permanently moved to San Diego, California, where his ailing mother resided. Here he became an associate at large of the Department of Development Research of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company until his retirement in 1934.Once married and divorced, Stone died in San Diego, California on May 20, 1943, and was buried in Mt. Hope cemetery alongside his mother Jeanne Stone and sister Egypta Stone Wilson. Shortly after his death, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a 1935 decision by the Court of Claims, which ruled that his 1900 tuning patent had priority over the U.S. counterpart to Marconi's four sevens patent.  Legacy John Stone Stone was issued about 120 patents in the United States, and a similar number in other countries, covering telegraph and telephone devices and radio technology. He won the Franklin Institute Edward Longstreth Medal in 1913. He was also awarded the Institute of Radio Engineers' Medal of Honor in 1923, For his valuable pioneer contributions to the radio art , and at the presentation ceremony, Frederick A. Kolster acknowledged his contributions with the following: No man has contributed more to the advancement of the Radio Science than has John Stone Stone, and no man is more thoroughly entitled to the full and grateful appreciation of the entire Radio World.  Other activities Among his political and other activities, he served as a member of the American Defense Society's Board of Trustees. He was also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; past president and vice president of the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers; vice president of the Wireless Telegraph Association of America; member of the American Electrochemical Society; Associate of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers; member of the Society of Arts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; member of the Mathematical and Physical Club; the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity, the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association of New England and a hereditary member of the Aztec Club of 1847.

            "text": "A plasma globe or plasma lamp is a clear glass container filled with a mixture of various noble gases with a high voltage electrode in the center of the container. When voltage is applied, a plasma is formed within the container. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of multiple constant beams of colored light . Plasma globes were popular as novelty items in the 1980s.The plasma lamp was invented by Nikola Tesla, during his experimentation with high frequency currents in an evacuated glass tube for the purpose of studying high voltage phenomena. Tesla called his invention an inert gas discharge tube . The modern plasma lamp design was developed by James Falk and MIT student Bill Parker.A crackle tube is a related device filled with phosphor coated beads.  Construction Although many variations exist, a plasma lamp is usually a clear glass sphere filled with a mixture of various gases at nearly atmospheric pressure. Plasma lamps are driven by high frequency alternating current at 2 5 kV. The drive circuit is essentially a specialized power inverter, in which current from a lower voltage DC supply powers a high frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high frequency, high voltage transformer. The radio frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center. Additionally, some designs utilize the globe as a resonant cavity, which provides positive feedback to the drive transistor through the transformer. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an electrode when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by capacitive coupling right through the glass. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the globe . If a hand is placed close to the globe it produces a faint smell of ozone, as the gas is produced by high voltage interaction with atmospheric oxygen. Some globes have a control knob that varies the amount of power going to the center electrode. At the very lowest setting that will light or strike the globe, a single tendril is made. This single tendril's plasma channel engages enough space to transmit this lowest striking energy to the outside world through the glass of the globe. As the power is increased, this single channel's capacity is overwhelmed and a second channel forms, then a third, and so on. The tendrils each compete for a footprint on the inner orb as well. The energies flowing through these are all of the same polarity so they repel each other as like charges: a thin dark boundary surrounds each footprint on the inner electrode. The globe is prepared by pumping out as much air as is practical. The globe is then back filled with neon to a pressure similar to one atmosphere. If the radio frequency power is turned on, if the globe is struck or lit , now, the whole globe will glow a diffuse red. If a little argon is added, the filaments will form. If a very small amount of xenon is added, the flowers will bloom at the ends of the filaments.The neon available for purchase for a neon sign shop often comes in glass flasks at the pressure of a partial vacuum. These cannot be used to fill a globe with a useful mixture. Tanks of gas, each with its specific, proper, pressure regulator and fitting, are required: one for each of the gases involved. Of the other noble gases, radon is radioactive, helium escapes through the glass relatively quickly, and krypton is expensive. Other gases such as mercury vapor can be used. Molecular gases may be dissociated by the plasma.  Interaction  Placing a finger tip on the glass creates an attractive spot for the energy to flow because the conductive human body is more easily polarized than the dielectric material around the electrode providing an alternative discharge path having less resistance. Therefore, the capacity of the large conducting body to accept radio frequency energy is greater than that of the surrounding air. The energy available to the filaments of plasma within the globe will preferentially flow toward the better acceptor. This flow also causes a single filament, from the inner ball to the point of contact, to become brighter and thinner. The filament is brighter because there is more current flowing through it and into the 150 pF capacity, or capacitance, presented by an object, a conducting body, the size of a human. The filament is thinner because the magnetic fields around it, augmented by the now higher current flowing through it, causes a magnetohydrodynamic effect called pinch: the plasma channel's own magnetic fields create a force acting to compress the size of the plasma channel itself. Much of the movement of the filaments is due to heating of the gas around the filament. When gas along the filament is heated, it becomes more buoyant and rises, carrying the filament with it. If the filament is discharging into a fixed object on the side of the globe, it will begin to deform into a curved path between the central electrode and the object. When the distance between the electrode and the object becomes too great to maintain, the filament will break and a new filament will reform between the electrode and the hand . An electric current is produced within any conductive object near the orb. The glass acts as a dielectric in a capacitor formed between the ionized gas and the hand.  History  In U.S. Patent 0,514,170 , Nikola Tesla describes a plasma lamp. This patent is for one of the first high intensity discharge lamps. Tesla used an incandescent type lamp globe with a single internal conductive element and excited the element with high voltage currents from a Tesla coil, thus creating the brush discharge emanation. He gained patent protection on a particular form of the lamp in which a light giving small body or button of refractory material is supported by a conductor entering a very highly exhausted globe or receiver. Tesla called this invention the single terminal lamp, or, later, the Inert Gas Discharge Tube .The Groundstar style of plasma globe was created by James Falk and marketed to collectors and science museums in the 1970s and 1980s. Jerry Pournelle in 1984 praised Orb Corporation's Omnisphere as the most fabulous object in the entire world and magnificent ... a new kind of art object , stating you can't buy mine for any price .The technology needed to formulate gas mixtures used in today's plasma spheres was not available to Tesla. Modern lamps typically use combinations of xenon, krypton and neon, although other gases can be used. These gas mixtures, along with different glass shapes and integrated circuit driven electronics, create the vivid colors, range of motions, and complex patterns seen in today's plasma spheres.  Applications Plasma globes are mainly used as curiosities or toys for their unique lighting effects and the tricks that can be performed on them by users moving their hands around them. They might also form part of a school's laboratory equipment for demonstration purposes. They are not usually employed for general lighting. However, in recent years, some novelty stores have begun selling miniature plasma lamp nightlights that can be mounted on a standard light socket.Plasma globes can be used for experimenting with high voltages. If a conductive plate or wire coil is placed on the globe, capacitive coupling can transfer enough voltage to the plate or coil to produce a small arc or energize a high voltage load. This is possible because the plasma inside the globe and the conductor outside it act as plates of a capacitor, with the glass in between as a dielectric. A step down transformer connected between the plate and the globe's electrode can produce lower voltage, higher current radio frequency output. Careful earth grounding is essential to prevent injury or damage to equipment.  Hazards Bringing conductive materials or electronic devices close to a plasma globe may cause the glass to become hot. The high voltage radio frequency energy coupled to them from within the globe may cause a mild electric shock to the person touching, even through a protective glass casing. The radio frequency field produced by plasma lamps can interfere with the operation of touchpads used on laptop computers, digital audio players, cell phones, and other similar devices. Some types of plasma globes can radiate sufficient radio frequency interference to interfere with cordless telephones and Wi Fi devices several feet or some meters away. If an electrical conductor touches the outside of the globe, capacitive coupling can induce enough potential on it to produce a small arc. This is possible because the globe's glass acts as a capacitor dielectric: the inside of the lamp acts as one plate, and the conductive object on the outside acts as the opposite capacitor plate. This is a dangerous action that can damage the globe or other electronic devices, and presents a fire ignition hazard.Perceptible amounts of ozone can be formed on the surface of a plasma globe. Many people can detect ozone at concentrations of 0.01 0.1 ppm, which is right below the lowest concentration at which ozone is considered harmful to health. Exposure of 0.1 to 1 ppm produces headaches, burning eyes, and irritation to the respiratory passages.

            "text": "Niagara Falls is a group of three waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles the international border of the two countries. It is also known as the Canadian Falls. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both islands situated in New York. Formed by the Niagara River, which drains Lake Erie into Lake Ontario, the combined falls have the highest flow rate of any waterfall in North America that has a vertical drop of more than 50 m . During peak daytime tourist hours, more than 168,000 m3 of water goes over the crest of the falls every minute. Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful waterfall in North America, as measured by flow rate. Niagara Falls is famed for its beauty and is a valuable source of hydroelectric power. Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century. Niagara Falls is 27 km northwest of Buffalo, New York, and 69 km southeast of Toronto, between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls was formed when glaciers receded at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation , and water from the newly formed Great Lakes carved a path over and through the Niagara Escarpment en route to the Atlantic Ocean.  Characteristics  Horseshoe Falls is about 57 m high, while the height of the American Falls varies between 21 and 30 m because of the presence of giant boulders at its base. The larger Horseshoe Falls is about 790 m wide, while the American Falls is 320 m wide. The distance between the American extremity of Niagara Falls and the Canadian extremity is 1,039 m . The peak flow over Horseshoe Falls was recorded at 6,400 m3 per second. The average annual flow rate is 2,400 m3 per second. Since the flow is a direct function of the Lake Erie water elevation, it typically peaks in late spring or early summer. During the summer months, at least 2,800 m3 per second of water traverse the falls, some 90 of which goes over Horseshoe Falls, while the balance is diverted to hydroelectric facilities and then on to American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls. This is accomplished by employing a weir the International Control Dam with movable gates upstream from Horseshoe Falls. The water flow is halved at night and during the low tourist season winter months and only attains a minimum flow of 1,400 cubic metres per second. Water diversion is regulated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty and is administered by the International Niagara Board of Control. The verdant green color of the water flowing over Niagara Falls is a byproduct of the estimated 60 tonnes minute of dissolved salts and rock flour generated by the erosive force of the Niagara River.  Geology The features that became Niagara Falls were created by the Wisconsin glaciation about 10,000 years ago. The retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved, thus creating the Great Lakes as we know them today. Scientists posit there is an old valley, St David's Buried Gorge, buried by glacial drift, at the approximate location of the present Welland Canal. When the ice melted, the upper Great Lakes emptied into the Niagara River, which followed the rearranged topography across the Niagara Escarpment. In time, the river cut a gorge through the north facing cliff, or cuesta. Because of the interactions of three major rock formations, the rocky bed did not erode evenly. The caprock formation is composed of hard, erosion resistant limestone and dolomite of the Lockport Formation . That hard layer of stone eroded more slowly than the underlying materials. Immediately below the caprock lies the weaker, softer, sloping Rochester Formation . This formation is composed mainly of shale, though it has some thin limestone layers. It also contains ancient fossils. In time, the river eroded the soft layer that supported the hard layers, undercutting the hard caprock, which gave way in great chunks. This process repeated countless times, eventually carving out the falls. Submerged in the river in the lower valley, hidden from view, is the Queenston Formation , which is composed of shales and fine sandstones. All three formations were laid down in an ancient sea, their differences of character deriving from changing conditions within that sea. About 10,900 years ago, the Niagara Falls was between present day Queenston, Ontario, and Lewiston, New York, but erosion of the crest caused the falls to retreat approximately 6.8 miles southward. The shape of Horseshoe Falls has changed through the process of erosion, evolving from a small arch to a horseshoe bend to the present day V shape. Just upstream from the falls' current location, Goat Island splits the course of the Niagara River, resulting in the separation of Horseshoe Falls to the west from the American and Bridal Veil Falls to the east. Engineering has slowed erosion and recession.  Future of the falls  The current rate of erosion is approximately 30 centimeters per year, down from a historical average of 0.91 m per year. At this rate, in about 50,000 years Niagara Falls will have eroded the remaining 32 km to Lake Erie, and the falls will cease to exist.  Preservation efforts  In the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay for a glimpse, and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park. Goat Island was one of the inspirations for the American side of the effort. William Dorsheimer, moved by the scene from the island, brought Olmsted to Buffalo in 1868 to design a city park system, which helped promote Olmsted's career. In 1879, the New York state legislature commissioned Olmsted and James T. Gardner to survey the falls and to create the single most important document in the Niagara preservation movement, a Special Report on the preservation of Niagara Falls . The report advocated for state purchase, restoration and preservation through public ownership of the scenic lands surrounding Niagara Falls. Restoring the former beauty of the falls was described in the report as a sacred obligation to mankind . In 1883, New York Governor Grover Cleveland drafted legislation authorizing acquisition of lands for a state reservation at Niagara, and the Niagara Falls Association, a private citizens group founded in 1882, mounted a great letter writing campaign and petition drive in support of the park. Professor Charles Eliot Norton and Olmsted were among the leaders of the public campaign, while New York Governor Alonzo Cornell opposed.Preservationists' efforts were rewarded on April 30, 1885, when Governor David B. Hill signed legislation creating the Niagara Reservation, New York's first state park. New York State began to purchase land from developers, under the charter of the Niagara Reservation State Park. In the same year, the province of Ontario established the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park for the same purpose. On the Canadian side, the Niagara Parks Commission governs land usage along the entire course of the Niagara River, from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.In 1887, Olmsted and Calvert Vaux issued a supplemental report detailing plans to restore the falls. Their intent was to restore and conserve the natural surroundings of the Falls of Niagara, rather than to attempt to add anything thereto , and the report anticipated fundamental questions, such as how to provide access without destroying the beauty of the falls, and how to restore natural landscapes damaged by man. They planned a park with scenic roadways, paths and a few shelters designed to protect the landscape while allowing large numbers of visitors to enjoy the falls. Commemorative statues, shops, restaurants, and a 1959 glass and metal observation tower were added later. Preservationists continue to strive to strike a balance between Olmsted's idyllic vision and the realities of administering a popular scenic attraction.Preservation efforts continued well into the 20th century. J. Horace McFarland, the Sierra Club, and the Appalachian Mountain Club persuaded the United States Congress in 1906 to enact legislation to preserve the falls by regulating the waters of the Niagara River. The act sought, in cooperation with the Canadian government, to restrict diversion of water, and a treaty resulted in 1909 that limited the total amount of water diverted from the falls by both nations to approximately 56,000 cubic feet per second . That limitation remained in effect until 1950. Erosion control efforts have always been of importance. Underwater weirs redirect the most damaging currents, and the top of the falls has been strengthened. In June 1969, the Niagara River was completely diverted from American Falls for several months through construction of a temporary rock and earth dam, clearly visible in the photograph at right. During this time, two bodies were removed from under the falls, including a man who had been seen jumping over the falls, and the body of a woman, which was discovered once the falls dried. While Horseshoe Falls absorbed the extra flow, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers studied the riverbed and mechanically bolted and strengthened any faults they found; faults that would, if left untreated, have hastened the retreat of American Falls. A plan to remove the huge mound of talus deposited in 1954 was abandoned owing to cost, and in November 1969, the temporary dam was dynamited, restoring flow to American Falls. Even after these undertakings, Luna Island, the small piece of land between the American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls, remained off limits to the public for years owing to fears that it was unstable and could collapse into the gorge. Commercial interests have continued to encroach on the land surrounding the state park, including the construction of several tall buildings on the Canadian side. The result is a significant alteration and urbanisation of the landscape. One study found that the tall buildings changed the breeze patterns and increased the number of mist days from 29 per year to 68 per year, but another study disputed this idea.In 2013, New York State began an effort to renovate Three Sisters Islands located south of Goat Island. Funds were used from the re licensing of the New York Power Authority hydroelectric plant downriver in Lewiston, New York, to rebuild walking paths on the Three Sisters Islands and to plant native vegetation on the islands. The state also renovated the area around Prospect Point at the brink of American Falls in the state park.  Toponymy Theories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. The Native American word Ongiara means thundering water; The New York Times used this in 1925. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as the Niagagarega people on several late 17th century French maps of the area. According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Onguiaahra, meaning point of land cut in two . In 1847, an Iroquois interpreter stated that the name came from Jaonniaka re, meaning noisy point or portage . To Mohawks, the name refers to the neck , pronounced onyara ; the portage or neck of land between lakes Erie and Ontario onyara.  History  Many figures have been suggested as first circulating a European eyewitness description of Niagara Falls. The Frenchman Samuel de Champlain visited the area as early as 1604 during his exploration of Canada, and members of his party reported to him the spectacular waterfalls, which he described in his journals. The first description of the falls is credited to Belgian missionary, Father Louis Hennepin in 1677, after traveling with the explorer Ren Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, thus bringing the falls to the attention of Europeans. French Jesuit missionary Paul Ragueneau likely visited the falls some 35 years before Hennepin's visit while working among the Huron First Nation in Canada. Jean de Br beuf also may have visited the falls, while spending time with the Neutral Nation. The Finnish Swedish naturalist Pehr Kalm explored the area in the early 18th century and is credited with the first scientific description of the falls. In 1762, Captain Thomas Davies, a British Army officer and artist, surveyed the area and painted the watercolor, An East View of the Great Cataract of Niagara, the first eyewitness painting of the falls. During the 19th century, tourism became popular, and by mid century, it was the area's main industry. Theodosia Burr Alston and her husband Joseph Alston were the first recorded couple to honeymoon there in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte's brother J r me visited with his bride in the early 19th century. In 1825, British explorer John Franklin visited the falls while passing through New York en route to Cumberland House as part of his second Arctic expedition, calling them so justly celebrated as the first in the world for grandeur .After the American Civil War, the New York Central Railroad publicized Niagara Falls as a focus of pleasure and honeymoon visits. In about 1840, the English industrial chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson traveled to Canada, stopping at the Niagara Falls long enough to make the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten minutes or more, the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson. The image is left right inverted and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of Horseshoe Falls; these were then transferred to engravings to illustrate No l Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes . On August 6, 1918, an iron scow became stuck on the rocks above the falls. The two men on the scow were rescued, but the vessel remained trapped on rocks in the river, and is still visible there in a deteriorate state, although its position shifted by 50 meters during a storm on October 31, 2019. Daredevil William Red Hill Sr. was particularly praised for his role in the rescue.After the First World War, tourism boomed as automobiles made getting to the falls much easier. The story of Niagara Falls in the 20th century is largely that of efforts to harness the energy of the falls for hydroelectric power, and to control the development on both sides that threaten the area's natural beauty. Before the late 20th century, the northeastern end of Horseshoe Falls was in the United States, flowing around the Terrapin Rocks, which were once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges. In 1955, the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in, creating Terrapin Point. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point. Altogether, 400 ft of Horseshoe Falls were eliminated, including 100 ft on the Canadian side. According to author Ginger Strand, the Horseshoe Falls is now entirely in Canada. Other sources say most of Horseshoe Falls is in Canada.The only recorded freeze up of the river and falls was caused by an ice jam on March 29, 1848. No water fell for as much as 40 hours. Waterwheels stopped, and mills and factories shut down for having no power. In 1912, American Falls was completely frozen, but the other two falls kept flowing. Although the falls commonly ice up most winters, the river and the falls do not freeze completely. The years 1885, 1902, 1906, 1911, 1932, 1936, 2014, 2017 and 2019 are noted for partial freezing of the falls. A so called ice bridge was common in certain years at the base of the falls and was used by people who wanted to cross the river before bridges had been built. During some winters, the ice sheet was as thick as 40 feet to 100 feet , but that thickness has not occurred since 1954. The ice bridge of 1841 was said to be at least 100 feet thick. On February 12, 1912, the ice bridge which had formed on January 15 began breaking up while people were still on it. Many escaped, but three died during the event, later named the Ice Bridge Tragedy.  Bridge crossings  A number of bridges have spanned the Niagara River in the general vicinity of the falls. The first, not far from the whirlpool, was a suspension bridge above the gorge. It opened for use by the public in July 1848 and remained in use until 1855. A second bridge in the Upper Falls area was commissioned, with two levels or decks, one for use by the Great Western Railway. This Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge opened in 1855. In 1882, the Grand Trunk Railway took over control of the second deck after it absorbed the Great Western company. Significant structural improvements were made in the late 1870s and then in 1886; this bridge remained in use until 1897.Because of the volume of traffic, the decision was made to construct a new arch bridge nearby, under and around the existing bridge. After it opened in September 1897, a decision was made to remove and scrap the railway suspension bridge. This new bridge was initially known as the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge; it had two decks, the lower one used for carriages and the upper for trains. In 1937, it was renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge and remains in use today. All of the structures built up to that time were referred to as Lower Niagara bridges and were some distance from the falls.The first bridge in the so called Upper Niagara area was a two level suspension structure that opened in January 1869; it was destroyed during a severe storm in January 1889. The replacement was built quickly and opened in May 1889. In order to handle heavy traffic, a second bridge was commissioned, slightly closer to American Falls. This one was a steel bridge and opened to traffic in June 1897; it was known as the Upper Steel Arch Bridge but was often called the Honeymoon Bridge. The single level included a track for trolleys and space for carriages and pedestrians. The design led to the bridge being very close to the surface of the river and in January 1938, an ice jam twisted the steel frame of the bridge which later collapsed on January 27, 1938. Another Lower Niagara bridge had been commissioned in 1883 by Cornelius Vanderbilt for use by railways at a location roughly approximately 200 feet south of the Railway Suspension Bridge. This one was of an entirely different design; it was a cantilever bridge to provide greater strength. The Niagara Cantilever Bridge had two cantilevers which were joined by steel sections; it opened officially in December 1883, and improvements were made over the years for a stronger structure. As rail traffic was increasing, the Michigan Central Railroad company decided to build a new bridge in 1923, to be located between the Lower Steel Arch Bridge and the Cantilever Bridge. The Michigan Central Railway Bridge opened in February 1925 and remained in use until the early 21st century. The Cantilever Bridge was removed and scrapped after the new rail bridge opened. Nonetheless, it was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in 2006.There was a lengthy dispute as to which agency should build the replacement for the Niagara Railway Arch, or Lower Steel Arch Bridge in the Upper Niagara area. When that was resolved, construction of a steel bridge commenced in February 1940. Named the Rainbow Bridge, and featuring two lanes for traffic separated by a barrier, it opened in November 1941 and remains in use today.  Industry and commerce   Hydroelectric power  The enormous energy of Niagara Falls has long been recognized as a potential source of power. The first known effort to harness the waters was in 1750, when Daniel Joncaire built a small canal above the falls to power his sawmill. Augustus and Peter Porter purchased this area and all of American Falls in 1805 from the New York state government, and enlarged the original canal to provide hydraulic power for their gristmill and tannery. In 1853, the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Mining Company was chartered, which eventually constructed the canals that would be used to generate electricity. In 1881, under the leadership of Jacob F. Schoellkopf, the Niagara River's first hydroelectric generating station was built. The water fell 86 feet and generated direct current electricity, which ran the machinery of local mills and lit up some of the village streets. The Niagara Falls Power Company, a descendant of Schoellkopf's firm, formed the Cataract Company headed by Edward Dean Adams, with the intent of expanding Niagara Falls' power capacity. In 1890, a five member International Niagara Commission headed by Sir William Thomson among other distinguished scientists deliberated on the expansion of Niagara hydroelectric capacity based on seventeen proposals but could not select any as the best combined project for hydraulic development and distribution. In 1893, Westinghouse Electric was hired to design a system to generate alternating current on Niagara Falls, and three years after that a large scale AC power system was created . The Adams Power Plant Transformer House remains as a landmark of the original system. By 1896, financing from moguls including J. P. Morgan, John Jacob Astor IV, and the Vanderbilts had fueled the construction of giant underground conduits leading to turbines generating upwards of 100,000 horsepower , sent as far as Buffalo, 20 mi away. Some of the original designs for the power transmission plants were created by the Swiss firm Faesch Piccard, which also constructed the original 5,000 hp waterwheels. Private companies on the Canadian side also began to harness the energy of the falls. The Government of Ontario eventually brought power transmission operations under public control in 1906, distributing Niagara's energy to various parts of the Canadian province. Other hydropower plants were being built along the Niagara River. But in 1956, disaster struck when the region's largest hydropower station was partially destroyed in a landslide. This drastically reduced power production and put tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs at stake. In 1957, Congress passed the Niagara Redevelopment Act, which granted the New York Power Authority the right to fully develop the United States' share of the Niagara River's hydroelectric potential.In 1961, when the Niagara Falls hydroelectric project went online, it was the largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 GW. Up to 1,420 cubic metres of water per second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the Lewiston and Robert Moses power plants. Currently between 50 and 75 of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through hydroelectric turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls. When electrical demand is low, the Lewiston units can operate as pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators. To preserve Niagara Falls' natural beauty, a 1950 treaty signed by the U.S. and Canada limited water usage by the power plants. The treaty allows higher summertime diversion at night when tourists are fewer and during the winter months when there are even fewer tourists. This treaty, designed to ensure an unbroken curtain of water flowing over the falls, states that during daylight time during the tourist season there must be 100,000 cubic feet per second of water flowing over the falls, and during the night and off tourist season there must be 50,000 cubic feet per second of water flowing over the falls. This treaty is monitored by the International Niagara Board of Control, using a NOAA gauging station above the falls. During winter, the Power Authority of New York works with Ontario Power Generation to prevent ice on the Niagara River from interfering with power production or causing flooding of shoreline property. One of their joint efforts is an 8,800 foot long ice boom, which prevents the buildup of ice, yet allows water to continue flowing downstream. In addition to minimum water volume, the crest of Horseshoe falls was reduced to maintain an uninterrupted curtain of water .In August 2005, Ontario Power Generation, which is responsible for the Sir Adam Beck stations, started a major civil engineering project, called the Niagara Tunnel Project, to increase power production by building a new 12.7 metre diameter, 10.2 kilometre long water diversion tunnel. It was officially placed into service in March 2013, helping to increase the generating complex's nameplate capacity by 150 megawatts. It did so by tapping water from farther up the Niagara River than was possible with the preexisting arrangement. The tunnel provided new hydroelectricity for approximately 160,000 homes.  Transport  Ships can bypass Niagara Falls by means of the Welland Canal, which was improved and incorporated into the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the mid 1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby Buffalo and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished with the help of the electric power produced by the river. However, since the 1970s the region has declined economically. The cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and Niagara Falls, New York, United States, are connected by two international bridges. The Rainbow Bridge, just downriver from the falls, affords the closest view of the falls and is open to non commercial vehicle traffic and pedestrians. The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge lies one mile north of the Rainbow Bridge and is the oldest bridge over the Niagara River. Nearby Niagara Falls International Airport and Buffalo Niagara International Airport were named after the waterfall, as were Niagara University, countless local businesses, and even an asteroid.  Over the falls   Jumps, plunges and walks  In October 1829, Sam Patch, who called himself the Yankee Leapster , jumped from a high tower into the gorge below the falls and survived; this began a long tradition of daredevils trying to go over the falls. Englishman Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel, drowned in 1883 trying to swim the rapids downriver from the falls.On October 24, 1901, 63 year old Michigan school teacher Annie Edson Taylor became the first person to go over the falls in a barrel as a publicity stunt; she survived, bleeding, but otherwise unharmed. Soon after exiting the barrel, she said, No one ought ever do that again. Days before Taylor's attempt, her domestic cat was sent over the falls in her barrel to test its strength. The cat survived the plunge unharmed and later posed with Taylor in photographs. Since Taylor's historic ride, over a dozen people have intentionally gone over the falls in or on a device, despite her advice. Some have survived unharmed, but others have drowned or been severely injured. Survivors face charges and stiff fines, as it is now illegal, on both sides of the border, to attempt to go over the falls. Charles Stephens, a 58 year old barber from Bristol, England, went over the falls in a wooden barrel in July 1920 and was the first person to die in an endeavor of this type. Bobby Leach went over Horseshoe Falls in a crude steel barrel in 1911 and needed rescuing by William Red Hill Sr. Hill again came to the rescue of Leach following his failed attempt to swim the Niagara Gorge in 1920. In 1928, Smiling Jean Lussier tried an entirely different concept, going over the falls in a large rubber ball; he was successful and survived the ordeal. In the Miracle at Niagara , on July 9, 1960, Roger Woodward, a seven year old American boy, was swept over Horseshoe Falls after the boat in which he was cruising lost power; two tourists pulled his 17 year old sister Deanne from the river only 20 ft from the lip of the Horseshoe Falls at Goat Island. Minutes later, Woodward was plucked from the roiling plunge pool beneath Horseshoe Falls after grabbing a life ring thrown to him by the crew of the Maid of the Mist boat. The children's uncle, Jim Honeycutt, who had been steering the boat, was swept over the edge to his death.On July 2, 1984, Canadian Karel Soucek from Hamilton, Ontario, plunged over Horseshoe Falls in a barrel with only minor injuries. Soucek was fined 500 for performing the stunt without a license. In 1985, he was fatally injured while attempting to re create the Niagara drop at the Houston Astrodome. His aim was to climb into a barrel hoisted to the rafters of the Astrodome and to drop 180 ft into a water tank on the floor. After his barrel released prematurely, it hit the side of the tank, and he died the next day from his injuries.In August 1985, Steve Trotter, an aspiring stuntman from Rhode Island, became the youngest person ever and the first American in 25 years to go over the falls in a barrel. Ten years later, Trotter went over the falls again, becoming the second person to go over the falls twice and survive. It was also the second duo ; Lori Martin joined Trotter for the barrel ride over the falls. They survived the fall, but their barrel became stuck at the bottom of the falls, requiring a rescue. On September 28, 1989, Niagara natives Peter DeBernardi and Jeffery James Petkovich became the first team to make it over the falls in a two person barrel. The stunt was conceived by DeBenardi, who wanted to discourage youth from following in his path of addictive drug use. The pair emerged shortly after going over with minor injuries and were charged with performing an illegal stunt under the Niagara Parks Act. On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a whitewater canoeist from Tennessee paddled over the falls in a closed deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics at the base of the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found. On September 27, 1993, John David Munday, of Caistor Centre, Ontario, completed his second journey over the falls. On October 1, 1995, Robert Douglas Firecracker Overacker went over the falls on a Jet Ski to raise awareness for the homeless. His rocket propelled parachute failed to open and he plunged to his death. Overacker's body was recovered before he was pronounced dead at Niagara General Hospital.Kirk Jones of Canton, Michigan, became the first known person to survive a plunge over Horseshoe Falls without a flotation device on October 20, 2003. According to some reports, Jones had attempted to commit suicide, he survived the fall with only battered ribs, scrapes, and bruises. Jones tried going over the falls again in 2017, using a large inflatable ball, but died in the process. Later reports revealed that Jones had arranged for a friend to shoot video clips of his stunt.On March 11, 2009, a man survived an unprotected trip over Horseshoe Falls. When rescued from the river he suffered from severe hypothermia and a large wound to his head. His identity was never released. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the man intentionally enter the water. On May 21, 2012, an unidentified man became the fourth person to survive an unprotected trip over Horseshoe Falls. Eyewitness reports show he deliberately jumped into the Niagara River after climbing over a railing. On July 8, 2019, at roughly 4 am, officers responded to a report of a person in crisis at the brink of the Canadian side of the falls. Once officers got to the scene, the man climbed the retaining wall, jumped into the river and went over Horseshoe Falls. Authorities subsequently began to search the lower Niagara River basin, where the man was found alive but injured sitting on the rocks at the water's edge.  Tightrope walkers  Tightrope walkers drew huge crowds to witness their exploits. Their wires ran across the gorge, near the current Rainbow Bridge, not over the waterfall. Jean Fran ois Blondin Gravelet was the first to cross Niagara Gorge on June 30, 1859, and did so again eight times that year. His most difficult crossing occurred on August 14, when he carried his manager, Harry Colcord, on his back. His final crossing, on September 8, 1860, was witnessed by the Prince of Wales. Between 1859 and 1896 a wire walking craze emerged, resulting in frequent feats over the river below the falls. One inexperienced walker slid down his safety rope. Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.Maria Spelterini, a 23 year old Italian was the first and only woman to cross the Niagara River gorge; she did so on a tightrope on July 8, 1876. She repeated the stunt several times during the same month. During one crossing she was blindfolded and during another, her ankles and wrists were handcuffed.Among the many competitors was Ontario's William Hunt, who billed himself as The Great Farini ; his first crossing was in 1860. Farini competed with Blondin in performing outrageous stunts over the gorge. On August 8, 1864, however, an attempt failed and he needed to be rescued.On June 15, 2012, high wire artist Nik Wallenda became the first person to walk across the falls area in 116 years, after receiving special permission from both governments. The full length of his tightrope was 1,800 feet . Wallenda crossed near the brink of Horseshoe Falls, unlike walkers who had crossed farther downstream. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it upon arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.  Tourism  Peak visitor traffic occurs in the summertime, when Niagara Falls is both a daytime and evening attraction. From the Canadian side, floodlights illuminate both sides of the falls for several hours after dark . The number of visitors in 2007 was expected to total 20 million, and by 2009 the annual rate was expected to top 28 million tourists.The oldest and best known tourist attraction at Niagara Falls is the Maid of the Mist boat cruise, named for an ancient Ongiara Indian mythical character, which has carried passengers into the rapids immediately below the falls since 1846. Cruise boats operate from boat docks on both sides of the falls, with the Maid of the Mist operating from the American side and Hornblower Cruises from the Canadian side.From the U.S. side, American Falls can be viewed from walkways along Prospect Point Park, which also features the Prospect Point Observation Tower and a boat dock for the Maid of the Mist. Goat Island offers more views of the falls and is accessible by foot and automobile traffic by bridge above American Falls. From Goat Island, the Cave of the Winds is accessible by elevator and leads hikers to a point beneath Bridal Veil Falls. Also on Goat Island are the Three Sisters Islands, the Power Portal where a statue of Nikola Tesla can be seen, and a walking path that enables views of the rapids, the Niagara River, the gorge, and all of the falls. Most of these attractions lie within the Niagara Falls State Park. The Niagara Scenic Trolley offers guided trips along American Falls and around Goat Island. Panoramic and aerial views of the falls can also be viewed by helicopter. The Niagara Gorge Discovery Center showcases the natural and local history of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge. A casino and luxury hotel was opened in Niagara Falls, New York, by the Seneca Indian tribe. The Seneca Niagara Casino Hotel occupies the former Niagara Falls Convention Center. The new hotel is the first addition to the city's skyline since completion of the United Office Building in the 1920s.On the Canadian side, Queen Victoria Park features manicured gardens, platforms offering views of American, Bridal Veil, and Horseshoe Falls, and underground walkways leading into observation rooms that yield the illusion of being within the falling waters. Along the Niagara River, the Niagara River Recreational Trail runs 35 mi from Fort Erie to Fort George, and includes many historical sites from the War of 1812. The observation deck of the nearby Skylon Tower offers the highest view of the falls, and in the opposite direction gives views as far as Toronto. Along with the Tower Hotel , it is one of two towers in Canada with a view of the falls. The Whirlpool Aero Car, built in 1916 from a design by Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, is a cable car that takes passengers over the Niagara Whirlpool on the Canadian side. The Journey Behind the Falls consists of an observation platform and series of tunnels near the bottom of the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. There are two casinos on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort and Casino Niagara.Touring by helicopter over the falls, from both the USA and the Canadian side, was described by The New York Times as still popular a year after a serious crash. Although The New York Times had long before described attempting to tour the falls as bent on suicide and despite a number of fatal crashes, the as many as 100 eight minute rides each day are hard to regulate; two countries and various government agencies would have to coordinate. These flights have been available since the early 1960s.  Media   Movies and television  Already a huge tourist attraction and favorite spot for honeymooners, Niagara Falls visits rose sharply in 1953 after the release of Niagara, a movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten. The 1956 animated short Niagara Fools featured Woody Woodpecker attempting to go over the falls in a barrel. The falls was a featured location in the major motion picture Superman II in 1980 and was the subject of a popular IMAX movie, Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic. Illusionist David Copperfield performed a trick in which he appeared to travel over Horseshoe Falls in 1990.The falls, or more particularly, the tourist supported complex near the falls, was the setting of the short lived Canadian shot U.S. television show Wonderfalls in early 2004. Location footage of the falls was shot in October 2006 to portray World's End of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Professional kayaker Rafa Ortiz's preparation to paddle over the falls in a kayak is documented in the 2015 film Chasing Niagara.Kevin McMahon's 1991 documentary film The Falls explored the place of Niagara Falls in the world's collective imagination, covering both positive and negative aspects of the culture around the falls.  Literature  The Niagara Falls area features as the base camp for a German aerial invasion of the United States in the H. G. Wells novel The War in the Air. Many poets have been inspired to write about the falls. Among them was the Cuban poet Jos Maria Heredia, who wrote the poem Niagara . There are commemorative plaques on both sides of the falls recognizing the poem. In 1818, American poet John Neal published the poem Battle of Niagara, which is considered the best poetic description of Niagara Falls up to that time. In 1835, as a poetical illustration to accompany a plate of the Horse Shoe Falls. artist Thomas Allom, Letitia Elizabeth Landon imagines an Indian girl who, having saved the life of a captured young European man, takes him as her husband only to be later abandoned by him. In her despair she guides her canoe over the falls in dramatic fashion: 'Upright, within that slender boat, they saw the pale girl stand, her dark hair streaming far behind uprais d her desperate hand.' Lydia Sigourney wrote two dramatic poems on the falls, Niagara, in 1836 and again in her Scenes in my native Land, Niagara, in 1845.  Music  Composer Ferde Grof was commissioned by the Niagara Falls Power Generation project in 1960 to compose the Niagara Falls Suite in honor of the completion of the first stage of hydroelectric work at the falls. In 1997, composer Michael Daugherty composed Niagara Falls, a piece for concert band inspired by the falls.  Fine art Niagara Falls was such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth and nineteenth century European and American landscape painting .

It is the oldest medal in this field of engineering. The award consists of a gold medal, bronze replica, small gold replica, certificate, and honorarium. The medal may only be awarded to a new leap breakthrough in the technological area of science.  Background The Edison Medal, named after the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison, was created on 11 February 1904 by a group of Edison's friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. Other recipients of the Edison Medal include George Westinghouse, Alexander Graham Bell, Nikola Tesla, Michael I. Pupin, Robert A. Millikan , and Vannevar Bush. A complete and authoritative list is published by the IEEE online.After the merger of AIEE and the Institute of Radio Engineers , in 1963, to form the IEEE, it was decided that IRE's Medal of Honor would be presented as IEEE's highest award, while the Edison Medal would become IEEE's principal medal. Eleven persons with an exceptional career in electrical engineering received both the IEEE Edison Medal and the IEEE Medal of Honor, namely Edwin Howard Armstrong, Ernst Alexanderson, Mihajlo Pupin, Arthur E. Kennelly, Vladimir K. Zworykin, John R. Pierce, Sidney Darlington, James L. Flanagan, Nick Holonyak, Robert H. Dennard, Dave Forney, and Kees Schouhamer Immink.

            "text": "A vacuum variable capacitor is a variable capacitor which uses a high vacuum as the dielectric instead of air or other insulating material. This allows for a higher voltage rating than an air dielectric using a smaller total volume. However, many dielectrics have higher breakdown field strengths than vacuum: 60 170 MV m for teflon, 470 670 MV m for fused silica and 2000 MV m for diamond, compared with 20 40 MV m for vacuum. There are several different designs in vacuum variables. The most common form is inter meshed concentric cylinders, which are contained within a glass or ceramic vacuum envelope, similar to an electron tube. A metal bellows is used to maintain a vacuum seal while allowing positional control for the moving parts of the capacitor.  Invention Nikola Tesla filed a patent in 1896 for a vacuum capacitor. The original use was to enhance the quality of the electrical components for handling currents of high frequency and potential . These components were necessary for the DC impulse research which Tesla was studying. Commercial products have been available since 1942.  Applications Vacuum variable capacitors are commonly used in high voltage applications: 5000 volts and above. They are used in equipment such as high powered broadcast transmitters, amateur radio RF amplifiers and large antenna tuners. Industrially they are used in plasma generating equipment, for dielectric heating, and in semiconductor manufacturing. The main applications today are RF plasmas of 2 to 160 MHz where the vacuum capacitor is used as the impedance variation part in an automatic matching network in the fabrication of chips and flat panel displays. Other variations of vacuum capacitors include fixed value capacitors, which are designed very much like the variable versions with the exception that the adjustment mechanism is omitted.  Comparison When compared to other variable capacitors, vacuum variables tend to be more precise and more stable. This is due to the vacuum itself. Because of the sealed chamber, the dielectric constant remains the same over a wider range of operating conditions. With air variable capacitors, the air moving around the plates may change the value slightly; often it is not much but in some applications it is enough to cause undesirable effects.Vacuum variable capacitors are generally more expensive than air variable capacitors. This is primarily due to their design and the materials used. Although most use copper and glass, some may use other materials such as ceramics and metals such as gold and silver. Vacuum variables also vary in adjustment mechanisms.  References   External links  Comet Vacuum variable capacitor Jennings high voltage vacuum capacitors . amsTECHNOLOGIES. Retrieved 2021 03 18.

            "text": "Ericsson Nikola Tesla d.d. is the Croatian affiliate of the Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Ericsson. The company is named after the inventor Nikola Tesla and is the largest specialized provider of modern telecommunications products, solutions and services in central and eastern Europe. The company is quoted on the Zagreb Stock Exchange, independently of Ericsson.  History Ericsson Nikola Tesla traces its roots back to the state owned Nikola Tesla Corporation founded in 1949 in Zagreb, then SFR Yugoslavia. It was very successful in the local telecommunications market, and the regional markets, especially of Europe, for over forty years. It became a licence partner of Ericsson of Sweden in 1953, selling large volumes of Ericsson systems into the USSR and other markets from 1958. In 1977, the company began making Ericsson AXE switches under licence. With the collapse of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia, the state began looking to privatize the corporation in the year 1992. By 1994, Ericsson emerged as the highest bidder and took a share of the corporation just short of majority ownership, integrating operations to a significant extent by 1995. In 2011, the company was Croatia's eighth largest exporter.  Operations The company is based in Zagreb, with some R D activities in Split. Staff number in excess of 1450. Gordana Kova evi serves as president of Ericsson Nikola Tesla and head of its Management Board, while its Supervisory Board is normally headed by the head of the Ericsson Market Unit which includes Croatia. Significant customers exist in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Russia, other states of the former USSR and SFR Yugoslavia, and parts of Africa and the Middle East, and the company markets to Croatia, foreign markets and the Ericsson Group. Sixty percent of sales are exports.  Finances Sales for 2007 totalled 1.78 billion US , having risen year on year for many years. Steadily rising costs of sales have eroded profit, with net income being just under 200 million US for 2007.Market capitalization exceeds US 300 million.

            "text": "Tesla is an American rock band from Sacramento, California. In late 1981, bassist Brian Wheat and guitarist Frank Hannon formed a band named City Kidd, which evolved into Tesla. By 1984, vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarist Tommy Skeoch, and drummer Troy Luccketta had joined the band, forming their classic lineup that appeared on all of the albums and live shows during their initial run. The band adopted the Tesla moniker shortly before recording their first album, as another band with a similar name already existed. Their debut album, Mechanical Resonance, was released in 1986, which produced two hit singles, Modern Day Cowboy and their cover of Little Suzi . The band's second album The Great Radio Controversy , peaked at number 18 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and produced the top ten single Love Song . During the height of the popularity of MTV Unplugged, the band recorded and released their third album, the live acoustic album Five Man Acoustical Jam in 1990. The album peaked at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and produced their top charting single , Signs , a cover of a song by the Five Man Electrical Band. Their follow up fourth album, Psychotic Supper peaked at number 13, but lacked a hit single, similarly their next album, 1994's Bust a Nut did well enough on the album charts, peaking at number 20, but also lacked any radio hits. The band broke up in 1996, but returned in 2000 with a live tour and album, both named Replugged. They have continued to record and tour, though Skeoch left in 2006 and was replaced by Dave Rude on guitars. Their most recent release is the single Time to Rock! , released in June, 2022. They have sold at least 14 million albums in the United States. The band is ranked at No. 22 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hair Metal, and have been described as a thinking man's hair metal band .  History   Formation and Mechanical Resonance  The band City Kidd was renamed Tesla during the recording of their first album, 1986's Mechanical Resonance, on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name . The band derived their name, certain album and song titles, and some song content from events relating to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Along with the band's next two studio albums, Mechanical Resonance was produced by Michael Barbiero and Steve Thompson. The band's original line up consisted of lead vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Robert Contreras, who was soon replaced by ex Eric Martin Band drummer Troy Luccketta. In the early days of their career, Tesla toured with David Lee Roth, Alice Cooper, Def Leppard, and Poison, which resulted in the band being categorized as a glam metal band. The band's members resented this labelling. The band, according to Troy Luccketta, now does not mind being called a part of that scene.The band released Mechanical Resonance LIVE on August 26, 2016, featuring live versions of every song from the original album, including a bonus track, Save That Goodness, produced by Def Leppard guitarist Phil Collen.  The Great Radio Controversy and Psychotic Supper  The band released their second album, The Great Radio Controversy, in 1989. The album helped solidify the band's growing reputation and fan base, and produced five hit singles, including the power ballad Love Song .In 1990, Tesla released Five Man Acoustical Jam, a live album featuring acoustic renditions of hits such as Comin' Atcha Live , Gettin' Better , Modern Day Cowboy , and Love Song . The album also featured a number of covers most notably a version of Signs , a 1971 hit by the Five Man Electrical Band. In 1991, the band released their third studio album Psychotic Supper. The band itself considers this to be their best album according to their official web site. The 1998 Japanese reissue import of Psychotic Supper contains one previously unreleased song, Rock the Nation , as well as the songs I Ain't Superstitious , and Run Run Run , both of which had only been previously available as b sides to two singles from The Great Radio Controversy.  Bust a Nut and hiatus  In 1994, the band released their fourth studio album Bust a Nut. The Japanese edition of Bust a Nut contains the previously unreleased cover of Led Zeppelin's The Ocean . After the release of Bust a Nut, Skeoch departed because of his struggle with substance abuse. He rejoined after completing rehab, only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four piece for a short while. However, it wasn't long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman's band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as Bar 7 with a single Four Leaf Clover , from the album The World Is a Freak. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon formed Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area's One Thin Dime.  Reunion, Into the Now and Real to Reel  After a break of six years, the Sacramento Bee reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played an emotional sold out show at ARCO Arena in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album Replugged Live. In 2002 they were featured in the Rock Never Stops Tour alongside other 1980s rock bands. 2002 saw the release of a further live album Standing Room Only which is just a single CD version of Replugged Live. In 2004, they released their fifth studio album Into the Now which debuted on the Billboard album chart at number 30. The album was well received by fans and the band was featured on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In the summer of 2006, the band embarked on the Electric Summer Jam Tour without guitarist Tommy Skeoch. Skeoch had left the band indefinitely to spend time with his family, and, as he later revealed on The Classic Metal Show , other reasons; particularly his continuing problems with substance abuse. Scott Johnson of the Sacramento band Rogue filled in for a time on this tour. Eventually Dave Rude replaced Skeoch permanently. Tesla recorded a two volume collection of cover songs titled Real to Reel, which was released on June 5, 2007. The recording is available as a 2 CD set. The first CD is sold in a case with a blank slot for the second CD. The second CD will initially be available to concert goers in the US at no additional charge beyond the cost of a ticket. The second CD was also given away with the August edition of Classic Rock magazine in Europe. At the end of August, Tesla announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.  Forever More and Twisted Wires  In June and July 2008, Tesla played a few shows in Europe and the US, including Sweden Rock Festival, Graspop Metal Meeting and Rocklahoma. On July 15, 2008 Tesla Comin' Atcha Live! 2008 was released from a live concert filmed February 22, 2008 at the sold out Myth Nightclub in Maplewood, Minnesota. The 2 hour show included hits Modern Day Cowboy , Love Song and Song and Emotion along with additional backstage footage. On August 11, 2008, it was reported that Tesla's next album, entitled Forever More, would be released on October 7 on their own record label, Tesla Electric Company Recordings. The album was produced by Terry Thomas, who produced Bust a Nut. The band aired the album's first single, I Wanna Live on radio stations across the globe on August 18 and kicked off a world tour on October 1. Forever More debuted No. 33 on The Billboard 200 chart and spawned singles I Wanna Live , Fallin' Apart and Breakin' Free . On May 10, 2011, the band played at a rally for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association. Tesla performed two songs, Signs and Love Song during the Kings HereWeRally at Cesar Chavez Park in Sacramento, California to celebrate the team staying in Sacramento for at least one more year. On July 12, 2011, they released a mostly acoustic album titled Twisted Wires and the Acoustic Sessions.  Simplicity and Shock  In June 2013, Tesla released a new single Taste My Pain on iTunes. They released their new album Simplicity on June 6, 2014.In 2015, the band did a tour with Def Leppard and Styx. On August 26, 2016, Tesla released Mechanical Resonance Live in celebration of the album's 30th anniversary. It included a new single Save That Goodness , written and produced by Phil Collen of Def Leppard. In April 2017, Tesla began working on their ninth studio album, Shock, which was produced by Phil Collen, and released on March 8, 2019.Tesla released the one off single Cold Blue Steel in August 2021, followed a year later by Time to Rock! .  Charity work While promoting their album The Great Radio Controversy, the band participated in a canned food drive that allowed free concert admission to contributors, this event was incorporated into the video for The Way It Is . In February 2005, Tesla headlined a benefit show at the PPAC in Providence, Rhode Island, for the victims of the Station nightclub fire. During the show the band auctioned off an autographed acoustic guitar, with the proceeds going to the Station Family Fund. 100 of the ticket sales also went to this charity.In February 2008, Tesla helped fund and headlined a benefit concert for victims of the Station nightclub fire. The show was broadcast by VH1 Classic. Tesla played three songs: What You Give , Signs , and Love Song , though What You Give did not make it onto the broadcast.  Musical style Tesla's music is generally categorized as hair glam metal, heavy metal, and hard rock.The band's first two albums were recorded with a typical 1980s glam metal sound, but with Mechanical Resonance having some elements of hard rock, and The Great Radio Controversy having some elements of blues. Psychotic Supper marked a slight change to a more bluesy and acoustic sound, but with their traditional pop metal sound staying.

            "text": "Tower to the People Tesla's Dream at Wardenclyffe Continues is a 2015 documentary film directed by Joseph Sikorski about Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower. The film documents the history and subsequent decline of the Wardenclyffe complex designed and built by Tesla in Shoreham, New York, as the main laboratory and facility for his experiments on wireless power transmission. Sikorski focuses his documentary on the role of J.P. Morgan, one of the main investors behind the project, claiming Morgan pulled his support after realizing free wireless energy would hurt his own business interests. Tesla could not find additional investments and in 1906 the project was abandoned and never became operational. After over a century of decay, the tower site was rescued by a successful fundraising campaign and will be converted into a museum the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe honoring the legacy of the Serbian American inventor. The film builds on Fragments from Olympus, a feature and original screenplay about Tesla's life written by Joseph Sikorski and Michael Calomino which received a best screenplay award at the Long Island International Film Expo in 2010.The distribution of the documentary was supported by a crowdfunding campaign hosted on Indiegogo and by an appeal published by comics writer Matthew Inman, who also features in the film. On October 4, 2014 the documentary premiered at the New Yorker Hotel in New York City, the same place where Tesla died in 1943. Director Jim Jarmusch, Tesla's great grandnephew William Terbo, the Consul General of Serbia Mirjana Zivkovic were among the guests. The official release date in the United States is October 4, 2015.  References   External links Official site Official trailer Tower to the People at IMDb",

            "text": "Zagreb is the capital and largest city of Croatia. It is in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb stands near the international border between Croatia and Slovenia at an elevation of approximately 122 m above sea level. In 2021 the city had a population of 769,944. The population of the Zagreb urban agglomeration is 1,071,150, approximately a quarter of the total population of Croatia. Zagreb is a city with a rich history dating from Roman times. The oldest settlement in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's itarjevo. The historical record of the name Zagreb dates from 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal city in 1242. In 1851 Janko Kamauf became Zagreb's first mayor,Zagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division it comprises a consolidated city county , and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts. Most of the city districts lie at a low elevation along the valley of the river Sava, but northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme and Sesvete districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain, making the city's geographical image quite diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres east west and around 20 kilometres north south.Zagreb ranks as a global city, with a Beta rating from the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia. Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries. Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia: here Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Major branches of Zagreb's economy include high tech industries and the service sector.  Name The etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used for the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb Diocese since the 12th century and was increasingly used for the city in the 17th century. The name is first recorded in a charter by archbishop of Esztergom Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum.The older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson. An even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag . For this, Hungarian linguist Gyula D csy proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.The name might be derived from Proto Slavic word gr b which means hill, uplift. hill', and za br g 'to or toward the hill' for the seemingly metathesized variant in Hungarian, Zabrag possibly modified from assumed Zabreg because of Hungarian vowel harmony. An Old Croatian reconstructed name Zagr b is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.The name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as probably of Roman origin but according to D csy it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of Zugram. In Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as Agranum , Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis . In Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb za grab , meaning to scoop or to dig . One folk legend illustrating this derivation ties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka oti is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water. In another legend, a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to scoop water from the Mandu evac well , using the imperative: Zagrabi, Mando! .  History  The oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD. The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centers: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela i , who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela i Square in his honor.During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.  Early Zagreb  The history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve ak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King B la IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.  16th to 18th centuries  There were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political center and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb became Croatian capital in 1557, with city also being chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola IX Frankopan.At the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology, and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council moved from Vara din to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara din and Karlovac general command.  19th to mid 20th century  In the 19th century, Zagreb was the center of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions. In 1850, the town was united under its first mayor Janko Kamauf.The first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878. After the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today. The first horse drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterized by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres, and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907. Since 1 January 1877, the Gri cannon is fired daily from the Lotr ak Tower on Gri to mark midday. The first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighborhoods like Stara Pe enica in the east and rnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars. In the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.During World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by Nazi Germany and the Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the Usta a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the Partisans at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of the six constituent socialist republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Contemporary era  The area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid 1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb , originally called Ju ni Zagreb .Today Novi Zagreb is divided in two city districts: Novi Zagreb zapad and Novi Zagreb istok The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato, and other settlements. The cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone in the south eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987. This event initiated the creation of pedestrian only zones in the city centre and numerous new sport infrastructure, lacking until then, all around the city.During the 1991 1995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two rocket attacks which killed seven civilians and wounded many. An urbanized area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre i , Samobor, Dugo Selo, and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.In 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one to affect the city since the destructive 1880 Zagreb earthquake.  Area and population development   Geography   Climate  The climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate with significant continental influences, very closely bordering on a humid continental climate as well as a humid subtropical climate . Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often very warm or even hot with occasional afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short lived. Temperatures rise above 30 C on average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in summertime, falling mainly during thunderstorms. With 840 mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's ninth wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than Brussels, Paris or London. Compared to these cities, however, Zagreb has less rainy days, but the annual rainfall is higher due to heavier showers occurring mainly in late spring and summer. Autumn in its early stage often brings pleasant and sunny weather with occasional episodes of rain later in the season. Late autumn is characterized by a mild increase in the number of rainy days and a gradual decline in temperature averages. Morning fog is common from mid October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the Medvednica mountain as well as south central districts along the Sava river being more prone to longer fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold, bringing overcast skies and a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39 mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with the first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of days with snowfall in wintertime has decreased considerably. Springs are generally mild and very pleasant with sporadic weather changes and are somewhat windier than other seasons. As the season progresses, sunny days become more frequent, bringing higher temperatures. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in springtime's early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around 1 C  and the average temperature in the summer is 22.0 C . The highest recorded temperature at the Maksimir weather station was 40.4 C in July 1950, and lowest was 27.3 C in February 1956. A temperature of 30.5 C was recorded on the since defunct Borongaj Airfield in February 1940.  Cityscape  The most important historical high rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela i Square, Cibona Tower , and Zagrep anka on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme .In the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.In Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.Due to a long standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10 story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4 8 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high rise buildings in Lani te or Kajzerica.  Surroundings  The wider Zagreb area has been continuously inhabited since the prehistoric period, as witnessed by archaeological findings in the Veternica cave from the Paleolithic and excavation of the remains of the Roman Andautonia near the present village of itarjevo. Picturesque former villages on the slopes of Medvednica, estine, Gra ani, and Remete, maintain their rich traditions, including folk costumes, estine umbrellas, and gingerbread products. To the north is the Medvednica Mountain , with its highest peak Sljeme , where one of the tallest structures in Croatia, Zagreb TV Tower is located. The Sava and the Kupa valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje is located on the other side of the Medvednica hill. In mid January 2005, Sljeme held its first World Ski Championship tournament. From the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as Velebit Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow capped peaks of the towering Julian Alps in neighboring Slovenia. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski runs, three ski lifts, and a chairlift. The old Medvedgrad, a recently restored medieval burg was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the Shrine of the Homeland, a memorial with an eternal flame, where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for homeland in its history, customarily on national holidays. The ruined medieval fortress Susedgrad is located on the far western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year. Zagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of umberak Medvednica fault zone. It's classified as an area of high seismic activity. The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the 1880 Zagreb earthquake , and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area. The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes. Croatian Chief of Office of Emergency Management Pavle Kalini stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible. However, in case of a strong earthquake, it's expected that 3,000 people would die and up to 15,000 would be wounded.

Economy and infrastructure Important branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe. Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city. The only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange , which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers. According to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at 32,185 and 27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of US 18,686 and 15,758.As of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about 870 .

A linear interpolation was used for the population data between 2011 and 2021. While data on the yearly averaged conversion rates between HRK, EUR and USD is provided by the Croatian National Bank, data regarding the PPP are based on OECD estimates.  Transport   Highways  Zagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways. The highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest. The A1 starts at the Lu ko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split . A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka Zagreb. Highway A3 was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway. A3 forms a part of the Pan European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass, and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.Highway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa. It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near continuous motorway level link between Zagreb and Western Europe. Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori an border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.The railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country. The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary are linked with truck routes. The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high speed tilting trains line via the Lika region ; a faster line along the Una river valley is in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Roads  The city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four lane highway encircling most of the city. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi story parking lots . The busiest roads are the main east west arteries, former Highway Brotherhood and Unity , consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba ka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city center. The avenues were supposed to alleviate the traffic problem, but most of them are nowadays gridlocked during rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day. European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.   Bridges  Zagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200 m . In downstream order, these are: There are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi evec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre i , and the other near Ivanja Reka . Two additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.  Public transportation  Public transportation in the city is organized in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas, and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail. The public transportation company ZET operates trams, all inner bus lines, and most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidized by the city council. The national rail operator Croatian Railways runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area and is a government owned corporation. The funicular in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction. Taxi market has been liberalized in early 2018 and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.   Tram network  Zagreb has an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner and middle suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30 50 kilometres per hour , but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts. An ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon ar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T V Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new TMK 2200 , trams by the end of 2012 made around 95 of the fleet.   Suburban rail network  The commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15 minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.A new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow gauge line to Samobor called Samobor ek was closed in the 1970s.  Air traffic  Zagreb Airport is the main Croatian international airport, a 17 km drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft. The airport had 3,45 million passengers in 2019 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers. Zagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu ko . It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu ko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.A third, small grass airfield, Bu evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.  Education  Zagreb has 136 primary schools and 100 secondary schools including 30 gymnasia. There are 5 public higher education institution and 9 private professional higher education schools.In Zagreb you will also find 4 International Schools: American International School of Zagreb The Learning Tree International Kindergarten French School in Zagreb The German School in Zagreb.  University of Zagreb  Founded in 1669, the University of Zagreb is the oldest continuously operating university in Croatia and one of the largest and oldest universities in the Southeastern Europe. Ever since its foundation, the university has been continually growing and developing and now consists of 29 faculties, three art academies and the Croatian Studies Centre. More than 200,000 students have attained the Bachelor's degree at the university, which has also assigned 18,000 Master's and 8,000 Doctor's degrees. As of 2011, the University of Zagreb is ranked among 500 Best Universities of the world by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities. Zagreb is also the seat of two private universities: the Catholic University of Croatia and the Libertas International University; as well as numerous public and private polytechnics, colleges, and higher professional schools.

            "text": "David Hatcher Childress is a French born American author, and the owner of Adventures Unlimited Press, a publishing house established in 1984 specializing in books on unusual topics such as ancient mysteries, unexplained phenomena, alternative history, and historical revisionism. His own works primarily concentrate on pseudoarchaeological and pseudoscientific topics such as Atlantis and Lemuria, pole shifts, the hollow earth, pre Columbian trans oceanic contact, suppressed technology, Nikola Tesla, free energy, UFOs and ancient astronauts, anti gravity, vimana aircraft, secret societies and other conspiracy theories. More recently, he has written on time travel and cryptozoology phenomena such as the yeti and sasquatch. Childress refers to himself as a rogue archaeologist .  Biography Born in France to American parents, and raised in Colorado and Montana, United States, Childress went to University of Montana Missoula to study archaeology, but left college in 1976 at 19 to begin travelling in pursuit of his archaeological interests. After several years in Asia and then Africa, Childress moved in 1983 to Stelle, Illinois, a community founded by New Age writer Richard Kieninger; Childress had been given one of Kieninger's books while touring Africa. Childress chronicled his explorations in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s in his Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries series of books. Childress's first book, A Hitchhikers Guide to Africa and Arabia, was published in 1983 by Chicago Review Press. In 1984, Childress moved to Kempton, Illinois, and established a publishing company named Adventures Unlimited Press, which is a sole proprietorship. His company published his own works and then those of other authors, presenting fringe scientific theories regarding ancient civilizations, cryptozoology, and little known technologies. In 1992, Childress founded the World Explorers Club, which occasionally runs tours to places he writes about, and publishes a magazine called World Explorer.Childress has appeared on NBC , Fox Network , Discovery Channel, A E, and History , to comment on subjects such as the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and UFOs. Since first entering the industry in 1984, Childress has been involved in two lawsuits regarding publishing; one, concerning the Kennedy assassination, failed after expiry of a statute of limitations and the other, involving an unpublished master's thesis about UFOs written in 1950, was settled out of court. Childress writes humorously about these suits in his 2000 autobiography A Hitchhiker's Guide to Armageddon. Childress has been interviewed on several radio programs.  Reception Patrick D. Nunn, a professor of geography at the University of the Sunshine Coast has noted that Childress is a proponent of pseudoscientific claims such as the lost continent Mu and megaliths on the Pacific islands built by levitation. Nunn has written that the disappearance of Mu is very convenient because it means that theorists like Childress can say what they like and appear convincing to people who are comparatively uninformed, as many naturally are, of the huge body of scientific information on Pacific geology and cultures. Historical archaeologist Charles E. Orser has criticized Childress's writings: Pseudo archaeologists continue to perpetuate the idea that Atlantis was a racialized place. David Hatcher Childress, one of the most flagrant violators of basic archaeological reasoning, has provided perhaps the most outrageous racialized vision of Atlantis. In discussing Tiahuanaco in Bolivia as a palace built long before any Native South Americans were present Childress proposes that the majestic site could only have been constructed by the Atlantean League. The league was composed of mythic seafarers who sailed the world spreading a megalithic culture, and wore red turbans over their blond hair . Nowhere did Plato, the only actual source on Atlantis, mention the blond hair of the Atlanteans. Plato did mention that the men and women of Atlantis, being semi divine, were inherently good . . . The correlation between goodness and whiteness is thus obvious in Childress's formulation and in much else that has been written about Atlantis.  Publications Childress's company has published nearly 200 books over the course of two dozen years. Childress himself has authored and co authored over a dozen books, from his first in 1983 to his most recent in 2013. His influences include Erich von D niken, Thor Heyerdahl, and Charles Berlitz.

            "text": "Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company was an electric lighting company in Rahway, New Jersey that operated from December 1884 through 1886.  History Based at the site where 1571 1579 Irving Street now stands, on Irving Street between Coach and Elizabeth, Rahway, New Jersey, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company was started in December 1884 after the inventor Nikola Tesla left Thomas Edison's employment following a disagreement over payment. The company was formed in a partnership between Tesla, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vale with Tesla given the task of designing an arc lighting system, a fast growing segment of the new electric light industry used mostly for outdoor lighting. Tesla designed an arc lamp with automatic adjustment and a fail switch as well as improved dynamos. These were the first patents issued to Tesla in the US. By 1886 he had installed a central station based system in Rahway lighting streets as well as a few factory buildings. The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment and, with the market already heavily controlled by Brush Electric Illuminating Company and the Thomson Houston Electric Company, they came to the conclusion it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems. By the fall of 1886 they had formed the Union County Electric Light Manufacturing Company spelling the end for Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing and leaving Tesla penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock.  Patents Tesla had already been issued the following patents: U.S. Patent 359,748 Dynamo Electric Machine 1886 January 14 U.S. Patent 334,823 Commutator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 January 26 Elements to prevent sparking on dynamo electric machines; Drum style with brushes. U.S. Patent 335,786 Electric arc lamp 1886 February 9 Arc lamp with carbon electrodes controlled by electromagnets or solenoids and a clutch mechanism; Corrects earlier design flaws common to the industry. U.S. Patent 335,787 Electric arc lamp 1886 February 9 Arc lamp's automatic fail switch when arc possesses abnormal behavior; Automatic reactivation. U.S. Patent 336,961 Regulator for dynamo electric machines 1886 March 2 Two main brushes connected to helices coil ends; Intermediate point branch shunt connection for third brush. U.S. Patent 336,962 Regulator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 March 2 Auxiliary brush es shunting a portion or whole of the field helices coil; Regulates energy flow; Adjustable level of current. U.S. Patent 350,954 Regulator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 October 19 Automatic regulation of energy levels; Mechanical device to shift brushes.

            "text": "Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company was an electric lighting company in Rahway, New Jersey that operated from December 1884 through 1886.  History Based at the site where 1571 1579 Irving Street now stands, on Irving Street between Coach and Elizabeth, Rahway, New Jersey, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company was started in December 1884 after the inventor Nikola Tesla left Thomas Edison's employment following a disagreement over payment. The company was formed in a partnership between Tesla, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vale with Tesla given the task of designing an arc lighting system, a fast growing segment of the new electric light industry used mostly for outdoor lighting. Tesla designed an arc lamp with automatic adjustment and a fail switch as well as improved dynamos. These were the first patents issued to Tesla in the US. By 1886 he had installed a central station based system in Rahway lighting streets as well as a few factory buildings. The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment and, with the market already heavily controlled by Brush Electric Illuminating Company and the Thomson Houston Electric Company, they came to the conclusion it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems. By the fall of 1886 they had formed the Union County Electric Light Manufacturing Company spelling the end for Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing and leaving Tesla penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock.  Patents Tesla had already been issued the following patents: U.S. Patent 359,748 Dynamo Electric Machine 1886 January 14 U.S. Patent 334,823 Commutator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 January 26 Elements to prevent sparking on dynamo electric machines; Drum style with brushes. U.S. Patent 335,786 Electric arc lamp 1886 February 9 Arc lamp with carbon electrodes controlled by electromagnets or solenoids and a clutch mechanism; Corrects earlier design flaws common to the industry. U.S. Patent 335,787 Electric arc lamp 1886 February 9 Arc lamp's automatic fail switch when arc possesses abnormal behavior; Automatic reactivation. U.S. Patent 336,961 Regulator for dynamo electric machines 1886 March 2 Two main brushes connected to helices coil ends; Intermediate point branch shunt connection for third brush. U.S. Patent 336,962 Regulator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 March 2 Auxiliary brush es shunting a portion or whole of the field helices coil; Regulates energy flow; Adjustable level of current. U.S. Patent 350,954 Regulator for Dynamo Electric Machines 1886 October 19 Automatic regulation of energy levels; Mechanical device to shift brushes.

            "text": "SS Oregon was a record breaking British passenger liner that won the Blue Riband for the Guion Line as the fastest liner on the Atlantic in 1884. She was sold to the Cunard Line after a few voyages and continued to improve her passage times for her new owner. In 1885, Oregon was chartered to the Royal Navy as an auxiliary cruiser, and her success in this role resulted in the Admiralty subsidizing suitable ships for quick conversion in the event of a crisis. She returned to Cunard service in November 1885 and four months later collided with a schooner while approaching New York. Virtually all persons on board were rescued before Oregon sank. Her wreck, 18 miles south of Long Island, remains a popular diving site.  Development and design Arizona and Alaska only allowed the Guion Line to schedule fortnightly sailings with express liners in each direction. On alternate weeks, Guion's sailings used ships that were considerably slower. Guion needed two additional ships for a balanced weekly service. When Cunard started to build a new fleet for its weekly Liverpool New York express service, Guion Line ordered Oregon to retain the Atlantic records won by Alaska. As her predecessors, Oregon was built at the Fairfield Yard of John Elder Company of Glasgow, Scotland, and cost 1,250,000.Oregon was 6.5 larger and four feet wider than Alaska, but the same length to reduce her ratio of length to beam and address the serious vibration problem experienced by Arizona and Alaska. Consideration was given to building Oregon of steel after the fiasco of City of Rome, but the new metal was still expensive and hard to obtain. Oregon was the last iron record breaker. She had nine transverse watertight bulkheads, five iron decks, and a strong turtle back deck forward and aft as a protection from the heavy seas.The compound steam engine built for Oregon had a 70 inch diameter high pressure cylinder flanked by two 104 inch diameter low pressure cylinders. The engine generated 12,500 indicated horsepower as compared to 8,300 for Alaska. Steam was generated from nine Fox patent double ended boilers, each 163 4 feet long and 161 2 feet in diameter. Daily coal consumption was 300 tons, an increase of 50 tons compared to Alaska and 165 tons over Arizona. The screw propeller was twenty four feet in diameter with a shaft that consisted of fifteen separate parts made of crucible steel.Oregon was fitted for 340 saloon, 92 second class, and 1,000 steerage passengers. Passengers traveling saloon or cabin were equivalent to first class today. On Oregon, steerage had been upgraded to third class and given assigned berths in small rooms rather than dormitories.The main public room, the grand saloon was in the forepart of the ship and described at the time as capable of dining the whole of the 340 cabin passengers. The ceiling decorations were almost exclusively confined to white and gold. The panels were of polished satinwood, the pilasters of walnut, with gilt capitals. The saloon measured 65 by 54 feet, and was 9 feet high in the lowest part. A central cupola of handsome design, 25 feet long and 15 feet wide, rose to a height of 20 feet, and gave abundant light and ventilation. The staterooms are large and well lighted and ventilated. Every facility for comfort is provided in the cabin. The ladies' drawing room is furnished in a costly manner, and is on the promenade deck. The latter extends nearly the entire length of the vessel. The wood work of the ladies' drawing room, the Captain's cabin, and the principal entrance to the saloons came from the State of Oregon. On the upper deck near the entrance of the grand saloon was the smoking room, which is paneled in Spanish mahogany and has a mosaic floor. The Oregon was also the first ship to have installed dynamos and incandescent electric lamps, supplied by the Edison Company, which were used in lighting the vessel. In 1884 the dynamos became badly damaged and were repaired by an engineer from the Edison Machine Works, Nikola Tesla, who had just transferred from Edison's European company. Tesla stayed up all night getting the dynamos back in order and received a compliment from Edison the next morning.  Service history Oregon sailed on her maiden voyage in October 1883 and was gradually broken in before attempting Alaska's records. On 5 April 1884, she won the eastbound record with a New York Queenstown run of 7 days, 2 hours, 18 minutes . On her return to New York, she also won the Blue Riband with a westbound voyage of 6 days, 10 hours, 10 minutes . However, the Guion Line was in financial difficulty because in January 1884, Stephen Guion's older brother, William resigned from the firm due to bad investments unrelated to the steamship line. Unable to make payments to the shipbuilder, Stephen Guion returned Oregon to her builders. At that time, Elders was completing two liners for Cunard to beat Oregon, and Cunard took the opportunity to acquire Oregon herself. On 7 June 1884, Oregon sailed under the Cunard flag and in August, bettered her eastbound record. In March 1885, during the Russian war scare over Afghanistan, the British Navy chartered sixteen passenger liners for conversion to auxiliary cruisers. While thirteen were converted, only Oregon and the Union Line's Moor were actually commissioned. Oregon proved successful because of her speed, and the Navy started to pay annual subsidies to passenger lines to make suitable ships available on call. When war fears abated, Oregon was returned to Cunard and on 14 November 1885, she resumed commercial sailings.With the completion of Umbria and Etruria, Oregon was now redundant on the New York express service, and Cunard announced that she was to be transferred to the Liverpool Boston route.  Sinking On what was supposed to be one of her last runs to New York, Oregon sailed from Liverpool on 6 March 1886 with 852 people on board, 647 passengers and a crew of 205, along with 1,835 tons of cargo and 598 bags of mail, under the command of Captain Phillip Cottier. At about 04:30am on 14 March only a few hours from her scheduled arrival in New York City  she collided with an unidentified schooner, most likely Charles H. Morse, which disappeared in those waters about the same time. The schooner evidently sank almost immediately upon impact with all hands. The hole in Oregon's side was described by one passenger as big enough for a horse and carriage. While the chief officer, who had been on duty on the bridge at the time of the collision and had scantly seen the lights of the schooner before she plowed into the liner's side, described the collision as being merely 'a glancing blow', several passengers who had been quartered in cabins close to the point of collision described it as being a terrible crash. An unsuccessful attempt was made by the crew to plug the hole with canvas. Two hours after the collision, the captain ordered Oregon to be abandoned, but the ten lifeboats and three emergency rafts aboard Oregon only had room for half of the 852 people on board. A woman named Mrs W.H. Hurst, who had been travelling in First Class along with her husband, was one of several passengers who later claimed that during the evacuation, a group of stokers and trimmers from the boiler rooms had tried to push ahead of the women and children to get into the lifeboats, and noted to have seen the first boat launched to be completely filled with them. She then noted that the officers in charge of the evacuation and several male passengers managed to regain order on the boat deck over these men. During the evacuation, the first class cricketer Charles Waller fell overboard and drowned.Finally, at 8:30 AM, the pilot boat Phantom and the schooner Fannie A. Gorham responded to Oregon's emergency flares and boarded all passengers and crew. At 10:30 AM, SS Fulda of Norddeutscher Lloyd also arrived, and the passengers and crew were transferred again. Eight hours after the collision, Oregon sank bow first in 125 feet of water. Her mast tops remained above water for several tides.Cunard sent divers to the wreck to determine if Oregon could be salvaged. However, the hull broke open when the ship hit the bottom. The loss amounted to 3,166,000 including 1.25 million for the ship, 700,000 for her cargo, 216,000 in passenger baggage, and 1 million for currency and other valuables carried in the mails. Oregon's purser managed to save a large shipment of diamonds in the ship's safe.Over the years, the ship's hull and iron decks have collapsed. However, the engine still stands 40 feet above the ocean floor near the ship's nine boilers.  References   External links",

            "text": "The St. Regis New York is a historic luxury hotel that opened in 1904. It is located at 2 East 55th Street in Manhattan, New York City, between Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. The hotel holds Forbes five star and AAA five diamond ratings.  History   Construction and opening  The St. Regis was built by one of the wealthiest men in America, John Jacob Astor IV, as a companion to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, of which he owned half. The Waldorf Astoria was, at the time, located 20 blocks south on Fifth Avenue in an area that had begun to decline in social importance as the area near Central Park gained favor. Astor's great grandfather, John Jacob Astor, had earlier built one of the first modern hotels in the world, the Astor House in Lower Manhattan, in 1836. At the suggestion of his niece, Astor named the new hotel after Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks. The lake had been named for a French Jesuit priest, Jean Fran ois R gis, known for his hospitality to travelers.The 18 story French Beaux Arts style hotel, the tallest in the city when built, was designed by architects Trowbridge Livingston, with interiors by Arnold Constable. Construction began in 1901 and almost instantly generated controversy, as the chosen site was directly across Fifth Avenue from the palatial homes of the Vanderbilt family and would also tower over the mansions of many other wealthy New Yorkers. The Bureau of Buildings soon discovered that the hotel's wood decorations were not sufficiently fireproofed, and Superintendent Stewart temporarily halted construction on May 14, 1902. The following year, the hotel's neighbors brought suit due to the blasting necessary to excavate the hotel's foundation. Justice Clarke ruled against them on November 10, 1903, allowing work to again continue. Finally, as the hotel neared completion in 1904, the neighbors made one last effort to halt its opening. Any establishment with a liquor license was required to gain the approval of the owners of 2 3 of all private property within 200 feet , and was required to be at least 200 ft from any church. The hotel was located directly across the street from Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. The hotel's neighbors showed that its property line was well within the 200 ft limit. The hotel maintained, however, that its main entrance, on 55th Street, was beyond the 200 ft limit, and the hotel prevailed in court.The hotel, which had cost the then staggering sum of 5.5 million , opened on September 4, 1904. The neighbors, however, had not given up their fight. William Rockefeller bought an adjacent mansion on October 17, 1904, to ensure the hotel would lose its 2 3 approval from its direct neighbors, and have its liquor license revoked. Astor responded by buying another adjacent mansion, to keep the license. Anonymous stories began to appear in local papers smearing the hotel's service. The hotel's reputation, however, was bolstered in December by the visit of Prince Fushimi Sadanaru, head of the Fushimi no miya shinn ke branch of the Japanese Imperial Family. The visit was given extensive press coverage, as was a dinner dance a few days later in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt's niece Corinne Robinson, which was attended by the President's daughter Alice Roosevelt. The following year, the conflict was resolved when friends of Astor's in the New York Senate passed an amendment to the liquor law, specifically exempting all hotels over 200 rooms, including the St. Regis.  Early history  Eight years after the hotel opened, John Jacob Astor died in the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic, and his son Vincent Astor inherited the hotel. Prohibition hit Vincent's hotel holdings hard. He closed his father's nearby Knickerbocker Hotel, converting it to an office building in 1920. Vincent sold the St. Regis to Benjamin Newton Duke's Durham Realty Corporation in February 1927. Within months, the Dukes added a new wing designed by Sloan Robertson to the hotel on the east end, along 55th Street. The wing nearly doubled the size of the hotel to 550 rooms, added a rooftop ballroom nightclub, and increased the height to 20 stories.In 1934, in the depths of the Great Depression, Vincent Astor foreclosed on the hotel's 5 million mortgage, and in May 1935, after a lengthy court battle, Vincent bought the hotel back from Mary Duke Biddle for 300,000, and set about remodeling it and restoring its reputation as New York's most elegant hotel.  Post Astor period  Vincent Astor died in 1959. The following year, the hotel's operating lease was sold by Webb Knapp, Inc. to Mexican hotel mogul Cesar Balsa. Balsa bought the hotel's leasehold from the Kratter Corporation in 1963. Finally, on November 20, 1964, Balsa bought the building itself and the land under it from the Franchard Corporation for 6 million, bringing his total investment in the hotel to 9 million . Balsa outbid two other buyers who both wanted to demolish the hotel and replace it with an office building. The hotel was named a New York landmark in 1965. Sheraton Hotels purchased The St. Regis from Balsa in February 1966, renaming it the St. Regis Sheraton. ITT Sheraton completely remodeled the hotel in 1977 and then closed it in 1988 for an even more thorough restoration. The hotel reopened in September 1991 as The St. Regis again, transformed at a cost of over 100 million into one of the most luxurious hotels in the world.  Flagship of two new brands  On January 13, 1992, ITT Sheraton designated 28 of its premier hotels as the ITT Sheraton Luxury Collection, with The St. Regis as the division's flagship.Starwood acquired Sheraton from ITT Corporation in 1998 and soon after decided to use the St. Regis name to launch a new brand of hotels. The St. Regis was made the flagship of a new line of St. Regis Hotels Resorts, ultra luxury establishments in major cities and resort destinations around the globe. At this time, the original hotel's name was changed slightly to The St. Regis New York, to differentiate it from the numerous other St. Regis hotels in the new chain.  21st century  The hotel's eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh floors were converted to The St. Regis Residences in 2006. The residences consist of 24 full ownership condominiums and 24 fractional ownership timeshare condominiums, a part of The Residence Club. The entire hotel was renovated in 2013 at a cost of 90 million. The work, designed by HDC Design and Stone Hill Taylor Architects, involved the gut renovation of all hotel rooms and most public spaces, and added a new restaurant and gym.In 2014, the retail portion of the hotel, facing Fifth Avenue, which includes the adjoining townhouse that Astor bought in 1904 to keep the hotel's liquor license, was sold to Vornado Realty Trust for 700 million. In May 2016, it was reported that Starwood was in talks with the Qatar Investment Authority to sell The St Regis New York and The St. Regis San Francisco for up to 1 billion. In the end, the Qataris only bought the San Francisco property in December 2016, for 175 million.  Famous residents The hotel has always had a number of permanent residents, as well as guests. The artist Salvador Dal and his wife Gala lived at the hotel every fall and winter from 1966 to 1973. William Paley and his wife Babe maintained an apartment there, as did Marlene Dietrich. In Donald Spoto's biography of Alfred Hitchcock, The Dark Side of Genius, he states that Hitchcock stayed in his favorite 5th floor suite at least a dozen times. John Lennon recorded a demo of Happy Xmas in his room. Nikola Tesla resided at the hotel in 1922.  King Cole Bar  The iconic Old King Cole painting by Maxfield Parrish, originally created for the Knickerbocker Hotel, was displayed at the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue after that hotel's closure in 1920. The painting was moved to the St. Regis in 1935. The painting was made the centerpiece of a new bar which opened in 1948: the King Cole Bar, which has remained a New York institution ever since.In 1934 , bartender Fernand Petiot invented a drink at the St. Regis which he called the Red Snapper . It has since become known around the world as the Bloody Mary and is the King Cole Bar's signature drink.The bar has been the setting for scenes in The Devil Wears Prada, Hannah and Her Sisters, The First Wives Club, and Gossip Girl.

            "text": "Kenneth Malcolm Swezey was an American journalist. He was a science writer living and working in New York City.  Biography Kenneth Swezey was born in Brooklyn on 11 June 1904. His mother, Carrie, was 42 at the time and his father, Edwin L. Swezey, was 47. He had a sister, Martha, who was 13 years older and a sister, Anna, who was 25 years older. From early on he wrote about science and technology, selling his first article, on how to make a wet cell battery, at age 11. In his late teens he got a job writing a column on radio technology for the New York paper The Sun. He would go on to contribute articles as a freelance writer for various magazines such as The Experimenter, Boys' Life, and Popular Science . He would often illustrated his articles with photographs he shot himself. He lived with his parents up into his twenty's but by his thirty's he was living alone in a nearby residence on Milton Street in Brooklyn, New York. After World War II he wrote many books explaining scientific principles, sometimes equating them with everyday life and use in the home workshop. He died of a heart attack in 1972 at the age of 67.  Association with Nikola Tesla  Swezey met Nikola Tesla in the 1920s . Swezey thought the United States should honor Tesla and spent most of his life collecting the Serbian American inventor's materials, writing about his inventions, and trying to memorialize him in other ways. This included organizing a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday in 1931. The event included congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, and a feature on the cover of Time magazine. He is associated with a Tesla Society that organized a 100th anniversary celebration of Tesla's birth in 1956. He also lobbied for ships, schools, and a unit of measurement to be named after Tesla as well as the issuing of a commemorative stamp.

            "text": "Resonant inductive coupling or magnetic phase synchronous coupling is a phenomenon with inductive coupling where the coupling becomes stronger when the secondary side of the loosely coupled coil resonates. A resonant transformer of this type is often used in analog circuitry as a bandpass filter. Resonant inductive coupling is also used in wireless power systems for portable computers, phones, and vehicles.  Applications Various resonant coupling systems in use or are under development for short range wireless electricity systems to power laptops, tablets, smartphones, robot vacuums, implanted medical devices, and vehicles like electric cars, SCMaglev trains and automated guided vehicles. Specific technologies include: Electreon WiTricity Rezence eCoupled Wireless Resonant Energy Link Other applications include: Data transmission such as with passive RFID tags and contactless smart cards. Resonant transformer of CCFL inverter that powers a cold cathode fluorescent lamp. Couple the stages of a superheterodyne receiver, where the selectivity of the receiver is provided by tuned transformers in the intermediate frequency amplifiers. High voltage sources for X ray production.The Tesla coil is a resonant transformer circuit used to generate very high voltages, and is able to provide much higher current than high voltage electrostatic machines such as the Van de Graaff generator. However, this type of system radiates most of its energy into empty space, unlike modern wireless power systems which waste very little energy. Resonant transformers are widely used in radio circuits as bandpass filters, and in switching power supplies.  History In 1894 Nikola Tesla used resonant inductive coupling, also known as electro dynamic induction to wirelessly light up phosphorescent and incandescent lamps at the 35 South Fifth Avenue laboratory, and later at the 46 E. Houston Street laboratory in New York City. In 1897 he patented a device called the high voltage, resonant transformer or Tesla coil. Transferring electrical energy from the primary coil to the secondary coil by resonant induction, a Tesla coil is capable of producing very high voltages at high frequency. The improved design allowed for the safe production and utilization of high potential electrical currents, without serious liability of the destruction of the apparatus itself and danger to persons approaching or handling it. In the early 1960s resonant inductive wireless energy transfer was used successfully in implantable medical devices including such devices as pacemakers and artificial hearts. While the early systems used a resonant receiver coil, later systems implemented resonant transmitter coils as well. These medical devices are designed for high efficiency using low power electronics while efficiently accommodating some misalignment and dynamic twisting of the coils. The separation between the coils in implantable applications is commonly less than 20 cm. Today resonant inductive energy transfer is regularly used for providing electric power in many commercially available medical implantable devices.Wireless electric energy transfer for experimentally powering electric automobiles and buses is a higher power application of resonant inductive energy transfer. High power levels are required for rapid recharging and high energy transfer efficiency is required both for operational economy and to avoid negative environmental impact of the system. An experimental electrified roadway test track built circa 1990 achieved just above 60 energy efficiency while recharging the battery of a prototype bus at a specially equipped bus stop. The bus could be outfitted with a retractable receiving coil for greater coil clearance when moving. The gap between the transmit and receive coils was designed to be less than 10 cm when powered. In addition to buses the use of wireless transfer has been investigated for recharging electric automobiles in parking spots and garages as well. Some of these wireless resonant inductive devices operate at low milliwatt power levels and are battery powered. Others operate at higher kilowatt power levels. Current implantable medical and road electrification device designs achieve more than 75 transfer efficiency at an operating distance between the transmit and receive coils of less than 10 cm.In 1993, Professor John Boys and Professor Grant Covic, of the University of Auckland in New Zealand, developed systems to transfer large amounts of energy across small air gaps. It was putting into practical use as the moving crane and the AGV non contact power supply in Japan. In 1998, RFID tags were patented that were powered in this way.In November 2006, Marin Solja i and other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology applied this near field behavior to wireless power transmission, based on strongly coupled resonators. In a theoretical analysis, they demonstrate that, by designing electromagnetic resonators that suffer minimal loss due to radiation and absorption and have a near field with mid range extent , mid range efficient wireless energy transfer is possible. The reason is that, if two such resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency are within a fraction of a wavelength, their near fields couple by means of evanescent wave coupling. Oscillating waves develop between the inductors, which can allow the energy to transfer from one object to the other within times much shorter than all loss times, which were designed to be long, and thus with the maximum possible energy transfer efficiency. Since the resonant wavelength is much larger than the resonators, the field can circumvent extraneous objects in the vicinity and thus this mid range energy transfer scheme does not require line of sight. By utilizing in particular the magnetic field to achieve the coupling, this method can be safe, since magnetic fields interact weakly with living organisms. Apple Inc. applied for a patent on the technology in 2010, after WiPower did so in 2008.In the past, the power source used on the JR Tokai SCMaglev car was generating with a gas turbine generator. In 2011, they succeeded in powering while driving across a large gap by the JR Tokai proprietary 9.8 kHz phase synchronization technology developed based on technology similar to AGV's wireless power scheme. And the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation evaluated the technology as all the problems for practical use were cleared. Construction of SCMaglev begin and commercial use will start in 2027.  Comparison with other technologies  Non resonant coupled inductors, such as typical transformers, work on the principle of a primary coil generating a magnetic field and a secondary coil subtending as much as possible of that field so that the power passing through the secondary is as close as possible to that of the primary. This requirement that the field be covered by the secondary results in very short range and usually requires a magnetic core. Over greater distances the non resonant induction method is highly inefficient and wastes the vast majority of the energy in resistive losses of the primary coil. Using resonance can help improve efficiency dramatically. If resonant coupling is used, the secondary coil is capacitive loaded so as to form a tuned LC circuit. If the primary coil is driven at the secondary side resonant frequency, it turns out that significant power may be transmitted between the coils over a range of a few times the coil diameters at reasonable efficiency.Compared to the costs associated with batteries, particularly non rechargeable batteries, the costs of the batteries are hundreds of times higher. In situations where a source of power is available nearby, it can be a cheaper solution. In addition, whereas batteries need periodic maintenance and replacement, resonant energy transfer can be used instead. Batteries additionally generate pollution during their construction and their disposal which is largely avoided.  Regulations and safety Unlike mains wired equipment, no direct electrical connection is needed and hence equipment can be sealed to minimize the possibility of electric shock. Because the coupling is achieved using predominantly magnetic fields; the technology may be relatively safe. Safety standards and guidelines do exist in most countries for electromagnetic field exposures . Whether the system can meet the guidelines or the less stringent legal requirements depends on the delivered power and range from the transmitter. Maximum recommended B field is a complicated function of frequency, the ICNIRP guidelines for example permit RMS fields of tens of microteslas below 100 kHz, falling with frequency to 200 nanoteslas in the VHF, and lower levels above 400 MHz, where body parts can sustain current loops comparable to a wavelength in diameter, and deep tissue energy absorption reaches a maximum. Deployed systems already generate magnetic fields, for example induction cookers in the tens of kHz where high fields are permitted, and contactless smart card readers, where higher frequency is possible as the required energies are lower.  Mechanism details   Overview  This process occurs in a resonant transformer, an electrical component which transformer consists of high Q coil wound on the same core with a capacitor connected across a coil to make a coupled LC circuit. The most basic resonant inductive coupling consists of one drive coil on the primary side and one resonance circuit on the secondary side. In this case, when the resonant state on the secondary side is observed from the primary side, two resonances as a pair are observed. One of them is called the antiresonant frequency , and the other is called the resonant frequency . The short circuit inductance and resonant capacitor of the secondary coil are combined into a resonant circuit. When the primary coil is driven with a resonant frequency of the secondary side, the phases of the magnetic fields of the primary coil and the secondary coil are synchronized. As a result, the maximum voltage is generated on the secondary coil due to the increase of the mutual flux, and the copper loss of the primary coil is reduced, the heat generation is reduced, and the efficiency is relatively improved. The resonant inductive coupling is the near field wireless transmission of electrical energy between magnetically coupled coils, which is part of a resonant circuit tuned to resonate at the same frequency as the driving frequency.  Coupling coefficient in the resonance state  In the transformer, only part of the flux generated by current through the primary coil is coupled to the secondary coil and vice versa. The part that couples is called mutual flux and the part that does not couple is called leakage flux. When the system is not in the resonance state, this leads to the open circuit voltage appearing at the secondary being less than predicted by the turns ratio of the coils. The degree of coupling is captured by a parameter called coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient, k, is defined as the ratio of transformer open circuit voltage ratio to the ratio that would be obtained if all the flux coupled from one coil to the other. However, if it is not open circuit, the flux ratio will change. The value of k lies between 0 and 1. Each coil inductance can be notionally divided into two parts in the proportions k: . These are respectively an inductance producing the mutual flux and an inductance producing the leakage flux. Coupling coefficient is a function of the geometry of the system. It is fixed by the positional relationship between the two coils. The coupling coefficient does not change between when the system is in the resonance state and when it is not in the resonance state, or even if the system is in resonance state and a secondary voltage larger than the turns ratio is generated. However, in the resonance case, the flux ratio changes and the mutual flux increases. Resonant systems are said to be tightly coupled, loosely coupled, critically coupled or overcoupled. Tight coupling is when the coupling coefficient is around 1 as with conventional iron core transformers. Overcoupling is when the secondary coil is so close and the formation of mutual flux is hindered by the effect of antiresonance, and critical coupling is when the transfer in the passband is optimal. Loose coupling is when the coils are distant from each other, so that most of the flux misses the secondary. In Tesla coils around 0.2 is used, and at greater distances, for example for inductive wireless power transmission, it may be lower than 0.01.  Voltage gain  Generally the voltage gain of non resonantly coupled coils is directly proportional to the square root of the ratio of secondary and primary inductances.       A     k                 L         2                L         1                        displaystyle A k sqrt frac L 2 L 1  , However, if in the state of resonant coupling, higher voltage is generated. The short circuit inductance Lsc2 on the secondary side can be obtained by the following formula.

The resonance frequency 2 is as follows.                2                1                L          s      c      2                  C          r                                1                               L           2                        C          r                          displaystyle omega 2 1 over sqrt L sc2 C r  1 over sqrt cdot L 2 C r  Assuming that the load resistance is Rl, the Q value of the secondary resonance circuit is as follows.         Q      2             R      l                      C         r                L         s     c     2                        displaystyle Q 2 R l sqrt frac C r L sc2  , The voltage generated in the resonance capacitor Cr at the peak of the resonance frequency is proportional to the Q value. Therefore, the voltage gain Ar of the secondary coil with respect to the primary coil when the system is resonating,         A      r          k     Q      2                      L         2                L         1                        displaystyle A r kQ 2 sqrt frac L 2 L 1  , In the case of the Type P P, Q1 does not contribute to the voltage gain.  WiTricity type resonant inductive coupling system  The WiTricity type magnetic resonance is characterized in that the resonant coils on the primary side and the resonant coils on the secondary side are paired. The primary resonant coil increases the primary driving coil current and increases the generated magnetic flux around the primary resonator. This is equivalent to driving the primary coil at high voltage. In the case of the type on the left figure, the general principle is that if a given oscillating amount of energy is placed into a primary coil which is capacitively loaded, the coil will 'ring', and form an oscillating magnetic field. Resonant transfer works by making a coil ring with an oscillating current. This generates an oscillating magnetic field. Because the coil is highly resonant, any energy placed in the coil dies away relatively slowly over very many cycles; but if a second coil is brought near it, the coil can pick up most of the energy before it is lost, even if it is some distance away. The fields used are predominantly non radiative, near fields , as all hardware is kept well within the 1 4 wavelength distance they radiate little energy from the transmitter to infinity. The energy will transfer back and forth between the magnetic field in the inductor and the electric field across the capacitor at the resonant frequency. This oscillation will die away at a rate determined by the gain bandwidth , mainly due to resistive and radiative losses. However, provided the secondary coil cuts enough of the field that it absorbs more energy than is lost in each cycle of the primary, then most of the energy can still be transferred. Because the Q factor can be very high, only a small percentage of the field has to be coupled from one coil to the other to achieve high efficiency, even though the field dies quickly with distance from a coil, the primary and secondary can be several diameters apart. It can be shown that a figure of merit for the efficiency is:       U     k            Q        1              Q        2                 displaystyle U k sqrt Q 1 Q 2  Where Q1 and Q2 are the Q factors of the source and receiver coils respectively, and k is the coupling coefficient described above. And the maximum achievable efficiency is:                o    p    t                    U        2                        2                     displaystyle eta opt frac U 2  2    Power transfer  Because the Q can be very high, even when low power is fed into the transmitter coil, a relatively intense field builds up over multiple cycles, which increases the power that can be received at resonance far more power is in the oscillating field than is being fed into the coil, and the receiver coil receives a percentage of that.  Transmitter coils and circuitry  Unlike the multiple layer secondary of a non resonant transformer, coils for this purpose are often single layer solenoids in parallel with a suitable capacitor. Alternative resonator geometries include wave wound Litz wire and loop gap resonators . In the Litz wire based resonators, insulation is either absent or low permittivity and low loss materials such as silk are used to minimise dielectric losses. The LGR geometries have the advantage that electric fields outside the resonator structure are very weak which minimizes human exposure to electric fields and makes the power transfer efficiency insensitive to nearby dielectrics.To progressively feed energy into the primary coil with each cycle, different circuits can be used. One circuit employs a Colpitts oscillator.In Tesla coils an intermittent switching system, a circuit controller or break, is used to inject an impulsive signal into the primary coil; the secondary coil then rings and decays.  Receiver coils and circuitry  The secondary receiver coils are similar designs to the primary sending coils. Running the secondary at the same resonant frequency as the primary ensures that the secondary has a low impedance at the transmitter's frequency and that the energy is optimally absorbed. To remove energy from the secondary coil, different methods can be used, the AC can be used directly or rectified and a regulator circuit can be used to generate DC voltage.

A carbon button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb. This type of lamp must be driven by high frequency alternating current, and depends on an electric arc or perhaps a vacuum arc to produce high current around the carbon electrode. The carbon electrode is then heated to incandescence by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current. Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of ionizing radiation. In February, 1892, Tesla gave a lecture to the Institution of Electrical Engineers, in which he described the carbon button lamp in detail. He also described several variants of the lamp, one of which uses a ruby drop in place of the carbon button.

            "text": "Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum is located at 280 Secor Road in the hamlet of Hartsdale, town of Greenburgh, Westchester County, New York, United States, about 25 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. It was founded in 1902, and is non sectarian. Ferncliff has three community mausoleums including columbariums, a crematory, a small chapel, and a main office located in the rear of the main building.  Mausoleums  Ferncliff Cemetery has three community mausoleums that offer what The New York Times has described as lavish burial spaces . This cemetery includes columbariums. As of 2001, a standard crypt space in the mausoleums was priced at 15,000. The highest priced spaces were private burial rooms with bronze gates, crystal chandeliers, and stained glass windows, priced at 280,000.  Ferncliff  The Ferncliff Mausoleum, aka The Cathedral of Memories , is the cemetery's oldest mausoleum, constructed in 1928. It has classic architecture, but the corridors are dark without glass panes to admit natural light. Ed Sullivan and Joan Crawford are two of the most famous interments in the main mausoleum.  Shrine of Memories  The Shrine of Memories is Ferncliff's second mausoleum and was constructed in 1956. Shrine of Memories is a more contemporary structure than Ferncliff Mausoleum . It has many panes of glass to admit natural light, and there is a painting of Christopher Columbus in the main hall of the building. Basil Rathbone is one of the most famous interments in Shrine of Memories .  Rosewood  Rosewood is Ferncliff's most recently completed community mausoleum, having been constructed in 1999. Joseph J. Mangan was the architect of Rosewood. Singer Aaliyah and her father Michael Haughton have a private room in Rosewood. Cab Calloway is interred with his wife Zulme Nuffie .  Ground burials The cemetery is also known for its in ground burials in sections located in front of the mausoleums. Ferncliff is one of the very few cemeteries that does not permit upright headstones in its outdoor plots. All outdoor grave markers are flush with the ground. This feature facilitates maintenance of the cemetery grounds. However, there are several upright headstones that were placed before this policy was instituted.

            "text": "Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use. Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics control, and electrical materials science.Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Institution of Engineering and Technology . Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.  History  Electricity has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. William Gilbert was a prominent early electrical scientist, and was the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity. He is credited with establishing the term electricity . He also designed the versorium: a device that detects the presence of statically charged objects. In 1762 Swedish professor Johan Wilcke invented a device later named electrophorus that produced a static electric charge. By 1800 Alessandro Volta had developed the voltaic pile, a forerunner of the electric battery.  19th century  In the 19th century, research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of Hans Christian rsted who discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle, of William Sturgeon who, in 1825 invented the electromagnet, of Joseph Henry and Edward Davy who invented the electrical relay in 1835, of Georg Ohm, who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the electric current and potential difference in a conductor, of Michael Faraday , and of James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 published a unified theory of electricity and magnetism in his treatise Electricity and Magnetism.In 1782, Georges Louis Le Sage developed and presented in Berlin probably the world's first form of electric telegraphy, using 24 different wires, one for each letter of the alphabet. This telegraph connected two rooms. It was an electrostatic telegraph that moved gold leaf through electrical conduction. In 1795, Francisco Salva Campillo proposed an electrostatic telegraph system. Between 1803 and 1804, he worked on electrical telegraphy and in 1804, he presented his report at the Royal Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Salva's electrolyte telegraph system was very innovative though it was greatly influenced by and based upon two new discoveries made in Europe in 1800 Alessandro Volta's electric battery for generating an electric current and William Nicholson and Anthony Carlyle's electrolysis of water. Electrical telegraphy may be considered the first example of electrical engineering. Electrical engineering became a profession in the later 19th century. Practitioners had created a global electric telegraph network, and the first professional electrical engineering institutions were founded in the UK and USA to support the new discipline. Francis Ronalds created an electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy. Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardised units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units volt, ampere, coulomb, ohm, farad, and henry. This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago in 1893. The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries, the definitions were immediately recognized in relevant legislation.During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of physics since the early electrical technology was considered electromechanical in nature. The Technische Universit t Darmstadt founded the world's first department of electrical engineering in 1882 and introduced the first degree course in electrical engineering in 1883. The first electrical engineering degree program in the United States was started at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the physics department under Professor Charles Cross, though it was Cornell University to produce the world's first electrical engineering graduates in 1885. The first course in electrical engineering was taught in 1883 in Cornell's Sibley College of Mechanical Engineering and Mechanic Arts. It was not until about 1885 that Cornell President Andrew Dickson White established the first Department of Electrical Engineering in the United States. In the same year, University College London founded the first chair of electrical engineering in Great Britain. Professor Mendell P. Weinbach at University of Missouri soon followed suit by establishing the electrical engineering department in 1886. Afterwards, universities and institutes of technology gradually started to offer electrical engineering programs to their students all over the world. During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882, Thomas Edison switched on the world's first large scale electric power network that provided 110 volts direct current  to 59 customers on Manhattan Island in New York City. In 1884, Sir Charles Parsons invented the steam turbine allowing for more efficient electric power generation. Alternating current, with its ability to transmit power more efficiently over long distances via the use of transformers, developed rapidly in the 1880s and 1890s with transformer designs by K roly Zipernowsky, Ott Bl thy and Miksa D ri , Lucien Gaulard, John Dixon Gibbs and William Stanley, Jr. Practical AC motor designs including induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and further developed into a practical three phase form by Mikhail Dolivo Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown. Charles Steinmetz and Oliver Heaviside contributed to the theoretical basis of alternating current engineering. The spread in the use of AC set off in the United States what has been called the war of the currents between a George Westinghouse backed AC system and a Thomas Edison backed DC power system, with AC being adopted as the overall standard.  Early 20th century  During the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James Clerk Maxwell during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of electromagnetic radiation including the possibility of invisible airborne waves . In his classic physics experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting radio waves with a spark gap transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these Hertzian waves into a purpose built commercial wireless telegraphic system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2,100 miles .Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 1894 1896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60 GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.In 1897, Karl Ferdinand Braun introduced the cathode ray tube as part of an oscilloscope, a crucial enabling technology for electronic television. John Fleming invented the first radio tube, the diode, in 1904. Two years later, Robert von Lieben and Lee De Forest independently developed the amplifier tube, called the triode.In 1920, Albert Hull developed the magnetron which would eventually lead to the development of the microwave oven in 1946 by Percy Spencer. In 1934, the British military began to make strides toward radar under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of the first radar station at Bawdsey in August 1936.In 1941, Konrad Zuse presented the Z3, the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943, Tommy Flowers designed and built the Colossus, the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer. In 1946, the ENIAC of John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives.In 1948 Claude Shannon publishes A Mathematical Theory of Communication which mathematically describes the passage of information with uncertainty .  Solid state electronics  The first working transistor was a point contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1947. They then invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. While early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass production basis, they opened the door for more compact devices.The first integrated circuits were the hybrid integrated circuit invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the monolithic integrated circuit chip invented by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959.The MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at BTL in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass produced for a wide range of uses. It revolutionized the electronics industry, becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world.The MOSFET made it possible to build high density integrated circuit chips. The earliest experimental MOS IC chip to be fabricated was built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA Laboratories in 1962. MOS technology enabled Moore's law, the doubling of transistors on an IC chip every two years, predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965. Silicon gate MOS technology was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild in 1968. Since then, the MOSFET has been the basic building block of modern electronics. The mass production of silicon MOSFETs and MOS integrated circuit chips, along with continuous MOSFET scaling miniaturization at an exponential pace , has since led to revolutionary changes in technology, economy, culture and thinking.The Apollo program which culminated in landing astronauts on the Moon with Apollo 11 in 1969 was enabled by NASA's adoption of advances in semiconductor electronic technology, including MOSFETs in the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform and silicon integrated circuit chips in the Apollo Guidance Computer .The development of MOS integrated circuit technology in the 1960s led to the invention of the microprocessor in the early 1970s. The first single chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. The Intel 4004 was designed and realized by Federico Faggin at Intel with his silicon gate MOS technology, along with Intel's Marcian Hoff and Stanley Mazor and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. The microprocessor led to the development of microcomputers and personal computers, and the microcomputer revolution.  Subfields One of the properties of electricity is that it is very useful for energy transmission as well as for information transmission. These were also the first areas in which electrical engineering was developed. Today electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and computer engineering, are considered disciplines in their own right.  Power and energy  Power Energy engineering deals with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called on grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called off grid power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.  Telecommunications  Telecommunications engineering focuses on the transmission of information across a communication channel such as a coax cable, optical fiber or free space. Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a carrier signal to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission; this is known as modulation. Popular analog modulation techniques include amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer. Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. Typically, if the power of the transmitted signal is insufficient once the signal arrives at the receiver's antenna , the information contained in the signal will be corrupted by noise, specifically static.  Control engineering  Control engineering focuses on the modeling of a diverse range of dynamic systems and the design of controllers that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers, electronics control engineers may use electronic circuits, digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and programmable logic controllers . Control engineering has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of commercial airliners to the cruise control present in many modern automobiles. It also plays an important role in industrial automation. Control engineers often use feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with cruise control the vehicle's speed is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's power output accordingly. Where there is regular feedback, control theory can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. Control engineers also work in robotics to design autonomous systems using control algorithms which interpret sensory feedback to control actuators that move robots such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous drones and others used in a variety of industries.  Electronics  Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of electronic circuits that use the properties of components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and transistors to achieve a particular functionality. The tuned circuit, which allows the user of a radio to filter out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example to research is a pneumatic signal conditioner. Prior to the Second World War, the subject was commonly known as radio engineering and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and radar, commercial radio, and early television. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems, computers, and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering. Before the invention of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number often millions of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful computers and other electronic devices we see today.  Microelectronics and nanoelectronics  Microelectronics engineering deals with the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components can be created at a microscopic level. Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100 nm processing having been standard since around 2002.Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.  Signal processing  Signal processing deals with the analysis and manipulation of signals. Signals can be either analog, in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or digital, in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of digital signal processing and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar, audio engineering, broadcast engineering, power electronics, and biomedical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts. Analog signal processing is still important in the design of many control systems. DSP processor ICs are found in many types of modern electronic devices, such as digital television sets, radios, Hi Fi audio equipment, mobile phones, multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems, noise cancelling headphones, digital spectrum analyzers, missile guidance systems, radar systems, and telematics systems. In such products, DSP may be responsible for noise reduction, speech recognition or synthesis, encoding or decoding digital media, wirelessly transmitting or receiving data, triangulating positions using GPS, and other kinds of image processing, video processing, audio processing, and speech processing.  Instrumentation  Instrumentation engineering deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instruments requires a good understanding of physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control.  Computers  Computer engineering deals with the design of computers and computer systems. This may involve the design of new hardware. Computer engineers may also work on a system's software. However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of software engineering, which is usually considered a separate discipline. Desktop computers represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer like architectures are now found in a range of embedded devices including video game consoles and DVD players. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing. Robots are one of the applications of computer engineering.  Photonics and optics  Photonics and optics deals with the generation, transmission, amplification, modulation, detection, and analysis of electromagnetic radiation. The application of optics deals with design of optical instruments such as lenses, microscopes, telescopes, and other equipment that uses the properties of electromagnetic radiation. Other prominent applications of optics include electro optical sensors and measurement systems, lasers, fiber optic communication systems, and optical disc systems . Photonics builds heavily on optical technology, supplemented with modern developments such as optoelectronics , laser systems, optical amplifiers and novel materials .  Related disciplines  Mechatronics is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and mechanical systems. Such combined systems are known as electromechanical systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and various subsystems of aircraft and automobiles. Electronic systems design is the subject within electrical engineering that deals with the multi disciplinary design issues of complex electrical and mechanical systems.The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as Microelectromechanical systems , are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.In Aerospace engineering and robotics, an example is the most recent electric propulsion and ion propulsion.  Education  Electrical engineers typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, electrical engineering technology, or electrical and electronic engineering. The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Electronics Engineering Technology, Bachelor of Engineering, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Technology, or Bachelor of Applied Science, depending on the university. The bachelor's degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and a variety of topics in electrical engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study. At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering , but in others, electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a Master of Engineering Master of Science , a Master of Engineering Management, a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering, an Engineering Doctorate , or an Engineer's degree. The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either research, coursework or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to academia. In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than a standalone postgraduate degree.  Professional practice  In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer , Chartered engineer or Incorporated Engineer , Chartered Professional Engineer or European Engineer . The advantages of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients . This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law. Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Institution of Engineering and Technology . The IEEE claims to produce 30 of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually. The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe. Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. An MIET is recognised in Europe as an Electrical and computer engineer.In Australia, Canada, and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25 of the labor force.  Tools and work From the Global Positioning System to electric power generation, electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test, and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of telecommunication systems, the operation of electric power stations, the lighting and wiring of buildings, the design of household appliances, or the electrical control of industrial machinery. Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to obtain both a qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer aided design programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others. Although most electrical engineers will understand basic circuit theory , the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI , but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off the shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, and the ability to understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering. A wide range of instrumentation is used by electrical engineers. For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. Where time varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. For instance, medical electronics designers must take into account that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. Audio electronics engineers use audio test sets consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. Likewise, information technology have their own test sets, often specific to a particular data format, and the same is true of television broadcasting. For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important. The workplaces of engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant, on board a Naval ship, the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers, and other engineers.Electrical engineering has an intimate relationship with the physical sciences. For instance, the physicist Lord Kelvin played a major role in the engineering of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Conversely, the engineer Oliver Heaviside produced major work on the mathematics of transmission on telegraph cables. Electrical engineers are often required on major science projects. For instance, large particle accelerators such as CERN need electrical engineers to deal with many aspects of the project including the power distribution, the instrumentation, and the manufacture and installation of the superconducting electromagnets.

            "text": "Tesla is a 2020 American biographical drama film written and directed by Michael Almereyda. It stars Ethan Hawke as Nikola Tesla. Eve Hewson, Ebon Moss Bachrach, Jim Gaffigan, and Kyle MacLachlan also star.The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 2020, and was released in selected theaters and via Premium VOD on August 21, 2020, by IFC Films.  Plot In 1893, Nikola Tesla and a female companion are roller skating. A narrator explains that Tesla was inspired as a young boy when he was petting his cat and saw static electricity. Nine years prior, in 1884 New York City, Tesla is working for Thomas Edison, who disregards Tesla's suggestions of using alternating current, and does not want to pay him for the invention. Their coworker explains that Edison's disapproval was partly because of the death of his wife, When they smash ice cream cones on each other, the narrator interrupts and says that isn't how it happened. She explains how Google searches on Tesla show very few photographs and usually the same headshots. She goes into Tesla's childhood and schooling, and also that he tried to start his own company but failed, and ended up having to dig ditches. Edison, on the other hand, has more popularity, twice as many search results, but lives a lavish lifestyle and married and widowed young with his first wife Mary. While Edison meets Mina, his second wife, in 1885, Tesla pitches his work on his induction motor to investors Brown and Peck. He and his assistant Szigeti impress Professor Anthony, who suggests he break up the invention into several patents. He meets Anthony's daughter Evelyn; and Anne Morgan, the daughter of J.P. Morgan and also the film's narrator. George Westinghouse, an inventor and businessman, buys Tesla's patents and fund production where the latter would get a royalty for every product installed in a home. He shares a rivalry challenge from Edison who claims that direct current is superior, and that alternating current is dangerous. Edison shows the Westinghouse invention as a capital punishment tool on William Kemmler, who had killed his wife. Meanwhile, Tesla demonstrates his invention to an audience using two induction sticks that glow. Szigeti invents a compass apparatus, but Tesla tells him it has already been invented, so Szigeti abandons his pursuits and seeks his fortune in South America. Kemmler's execution by electric chair is botched. Anne gets to know Tesla more. Tesla's invention is used to power's the World's Fair in 1893 in Chicago. Edison meets with Tesla and admits he was wrong about alternating current, and then he offers to partner with Tesla. Anne clarifies that this meeting never happened: Edison neither apologized nor offered to join forces. Westinghouse tells Tesla that in order to keep his business going, he needs to do a merger, but has to cancel Tesla's contract regarding his horsepower royalties. Tesla tears up his contract. Sarah Bernhardt, a celebrity actress, records for Edison's gramophone. She meets Tesla at her event, but Edison is envious of Tesla and escorts her away. Later, Tesla oversees the design of the Niagara Falls hydroelectric power plant. J.P. Morgan asks Anne if she thinks Tesla is interested in romancing her. Anne talks with Tesla about it, but finds he has plans for another invention, but unfortunately he is moving far away to Colorado. In 1899 Colorado Springs, he sets up his Tesla coil to harness and to transmit the power of the lightning storms. Tesla meets up with Bernhardt who is touring the area. She shows interest in him, and invites him to attend her performance, but he does not show up. J.P. Morgan invests in his invention, giving him a check, which Tesla accepts. In 1901, Edison's mining venture fails and he loses four million dollars. Tesla has not shown much progress in his work either, and even though Marconi has used Tesla's patents to transmit wireless signals, Tesla seems to be more interested in receiving and decoding signals he believes are from Mars. He asks J.P. Morgan for more funding, but is declined. There's a scene of Tesla singing to Everybody Wants to Rule the World , along with montage stills from the film. Realizing she has no future with Tesla, Anne moves to France to work with an organization helping children. She explains how Tesla outlived his peers but dies alone at 87 years old. She reflects that today's world might be what he had imagined.  Cast   Production In February 2018, it was announced Ethan Hawke had joined the cast of the film, with Michael Almereyda directing from a screenplay he wrote. The script was an updated form of the first feature Almereyda ever wrote, a Tesla biopic originally optioned to Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski that was never made. Almereyda reinvented it for the present moment, adding details about Tesla that had been published or discovered since then and including changes based on other influences such as films by director Derek Jarman, episodes of Drunk History and author Henry James.  Release Tesla had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 27, 2020, where it won the Alfred P. Sloan Award. Shortly after, IFC Films acquired distribution rights to the film and released it in selected theaters and via Premium VOD on August 21, 2020.  Reception   Box office and VOD  Tesla grossed 93,147 in the United States and Canada, and 365,904 in other territories, for a worldwide total of 459,051. It made 42,165 from 108 theaters in its opening weekend. That same weekend the film was the second most rented on Apple TV, before finishing 10th at Apple TV and ninth on Spectrum the following weekend.  Critical response  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58 based on 178 reviews, with an average rating of 6 10. The site's critics consensus reads, Appropriately bold and ambitious, Tesla takes a number of risks that don't always pay off but Ethan Hawke's performance makes those flaws easier to forgive. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews.  References   External links Tesla at IMDb",

            "text": "Martin Sekuli was a mathematics and physics teacher from Karlovac, one of the few high school professors who were members of the Croatian community of physicists at the time.  Biography Martin Sekuli was born in Lovinac. He taught at the Higher Real School in Rakovac . He was a corresponding member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. He was also a member of the Croatian pedagogic and literary society .He published several articles in German language journals, such as in the Annalen der Physik in 1872 and 1875. He published several works in the Rad journal of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, such as Fluorescencija i calcescencija and Iztra ivanje sun ane duge . In the 1871 treatise, he explains the effect of the luminescence in some elements and in the 1873 one he talks about the visible spectrum of the sun's light. In the 1871 treatise, Sekuli also predicted the existence of electromagnetic oscillations at different frequencies.During the period in which Martin Sekuli was the custodian of the science cabinet of his high school, he would inform his students of the very latest discoveries in the world of physics, and by the school year 1880 81 they had amassed a total of 277 machines for demonstration purposes, including a spectroscope modified by Sekuli himself.Sekuli died in Zagreb. The inventor Nikola Tesla noted in his 1919 autobiography My Inventions that when he attended the Kraljevska Velika Realka in Rakovac between 1870 and 1873, demonstrations of electricity by his professor of physics sparked his interest in this mysterious phenomena and made him want to know more of this wonderful force . The details of who was teaching physics at that time and the nature of the demonstrations described have led some to conclude this professor was Martin Sekuli .

            "text": "The Nikola Tesla Museum is a science museum located in the central area of Belgrade, Serbia. It is dedicated to honoring and displaying the life and work of Nikola Tesla as well as the final resting place for Tesla. It holds more than 160,000 original documents, over 2,000 books and journals, over 1,200 historical technical exhibits, over 1,500 photographs and photo plates of original, technical objects, instruments and apparatus, and over 1,000 plans and drawings. The Nikola Tesla Archive was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003 due to its critical role regarding history of electrification of the world and future technological advancements in this area.  History The Nikola Tesla Museum is housed in a residential villa built in 1927 according to the designs of Dragi a Bra ovan, a distinguished Serbian architect. The building was used for various purposes until December 5, 1952, when the Nikola Tesla Museum was founded in accordance with the decision of the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Certain items for the museum were shipped from New York City to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on September 7, 1951, as a result of efforts by Sava Kosanovi , Tesla's nephew and closest relative and his attorney Philip Wittenberg.  Exhibitions  The permanent exhibition was arranged in 1955. From time to time there have been some modifications, but for many years the basic concept has remained the same. Its first part is primarily a memorial exhibition, while the second part is an interactive one, with 3D computer generated models of Tesla's inventions. From time to time, the museum organizes thematic exhibitions of documents, photographs and other material in order to display some periods from Tesla's inventive life.  Reconstruction  Reconstruction of the Nikola Tesla Museum started on November 3, 2006. The first phase of the project was scheduled to have been complete by the end of 2006. The garden on the roof of the museum was designed to be enclosed by glass windows, which would turn the roof into a computer room. This reconstruction is now complete, and the museum is available to visit.

            "text": "My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla is a book compiled and edited by Ben Johnston detailing the work of Nikola Tesla. The content was largely drawn from a series of articles that Nikola Tesla had written for Electrical Experimenter magazine in 1919, when he was 63 years old. Tesla's personal account is divided into six chapters covering different periods of his life: My Early Life, My First Efforts At Invention, My Later Endeavors, The Discovery of the Rotating Magnetic Field, The Discovery of the Tesla Coil and Transformer, The Magnifying Transmitter, and The Art of Telautomatics.  Publication history Tesla's autobiography was first published as a six part 1919 series in the Electrical Experimenter magazine, in the February June, and October issues. The series was republished as Moji Pronalasci My Inventions, kolska Knjiga, Zagreb, 1977, on the occasion of Tesla's 120th anniversary, with side by side English and Serbo Croatian translations by Tomo Bosanac and Vanja Aljinovi , Branimira Vali , ed. It is presently available in book form, My Inventions : The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, Hart Brothers, Williston, Vermont, 1982, giovanni Herran. Figures with an 18 page introduction by Ben Johnston. Hugo Gernsback also wrote his own introduction to the series which was published in the January 1919 issue.  The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla is the renamed Part One, The Life of Tesla by Tesla. The Strange Life of Nikola Tesla was published by Kolmogorov Smirnov Publishing, and subsequently became the first online version of Nikola Tesla's Autobiography. It was transcribed by John Rolad Penner in 1994 1 from a small typed booklet, then photocopied and stapled. The booklet includes no means of contacting the publisher, although the name 'Kolmogorov Smirnov Publishing' appears after the title page. The only form of date identification is the hand written purchase date: April 29, 1978. The text was first made available on GEnie in 1995 under the GNU General Public License, and from there, soon began to propagate onto the Internet.Although it is the first electronic version of Tesla's autobiography available online it contains many significant errors carried over from the original photocopied text. Online Internet scrutiny has subsequently revealed numerous omissions and additions that did not appear in the original serial text published in Electrical Experimenter magazine.The original six part series published in Electrical Experimenter Magazine in 1919 has been republished in book form as: My Inventions, The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla . A nearly unabridged version of My Inventions in various file formats is also freely available in electronic form at www.tfcbooks.com special mi link.htm. It supersedes the earlier corrupted text.

            "text": "Shoreham is an incorporated village in the Town of Brookhaven, Suffolk County, New York, United States. The population was 531 at the 2010 census. It is officially known as the Incorporated Village of Shoreham.  History At Shoreham, Nikola Tesla built the Wardenclyffe Tower, which was dismantled in 1917. Nowadays there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable. A non profit organization is in the process of turning Nikola Tesla's laboratory and the property where the Wardenclyffe Tower was once located into a museum honoring the life and work of Nikola Tesla.The Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant was approved for Shoreham, but it was later disapproved as the result of public protest. The builder, Long Island Lighting Company , was partially reimbursed for money spent on construction. The municipal bonds that were floated to reimburse the builder are being paid off by a special levy on the electric bills of residents of Long Island. Shoreham was served by the Shoreham LIRR station from 1900 to 1910. It was located near the intersection of North Country Road and Randall Road.  Geography Shoreham is located on the North Shore of Long Island. It is approximately 100 km from New York City. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.4 square miles , all land. East Shoreham and Shoreham share a post office, which has 11786 as the zip code. Despite the official names, most local people invariably refer to East Shoreham as Shoreham, and to Shoreham as Shoreham Village.  Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 417 people, 145 households, and 126 families residing in the village. The population density was 938.3 people per square mile . There were 163 housing units at an average density of 366.8 per square mile . In 2010, the racial makeup of the village was 72.4 White, 12.6 Black or African American, 4.8 Asian, 0.9 Native American, and 0.2 Pacific Islander. 6.2 were of some other race, and 2.9 were of two or more races; Hispanics of any race comprised 16.3 of the population.There were 145 households, out of which 38.6 had children under the age of 18 living with them, 74.5 were married couples living together, 8.3 had a female householder with no husband present, and 13.1 were non families. 11.0 of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.9 had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average family size was 3.11. In the village, the population was spread out, with 27.6 under the age of 18, 6.2 from 18 to 24, 17.7 from 25 to 44, 36.0 from 45 to 64, and 12.5 who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.8 males. The median income for a household in the village was 109,719, and the median income for a family was 116,985. Males had a median income of 81,873 versus 31,250 for females. The per capita income for the village was 37,620. None of the families and 1.4 of the population were living below the poverty threshold, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

            "text": "Telegeodynamics is an electromechanical earth resonance concept for underground seismic exploration proposed by Nikola Tesla.  Description Tesla designed this system for use in prospecting and discerning the location of underground mineral structures through the transmission of mechanical energy through the subsurface. Data from reflected and refracted signals can be analyzed to deduce the location and characteristics of underground formations. Additional non mechanical responses to the initial acoustic impulses may also be detectable using instruments that measure various electrical and magnetic parameters. Such predicted responses would at least take the form of induced electric and magnetic fields, telluric currents, and changes in earth conductivity. The electromechanical oscillator was originally designed as a source of isochronous , alternating electric current used with both wireless transmitting and receiving apparatus. In dynamical system theory an oscillator is called isochronous if the frequency is independent of its amplitude. An electromechanical device runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so it maintains a constant frequency .

            "text": "The tesla is the unit of magnetic flux density in the International System of Units . One tesla is equal to one weber per square metre. The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named in honour of Serbian American electrical and mechanical engineer Nikola Tesla, upon the proposal of the Slovenian electrical engineer France Av in. The strongest fields encountered from permanent magnets on Earth are from Halbach spheres and can be over 4.5 T. The record for the highest sustained pulsed magnetic field has been produced by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory campus of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, the world's first 100 tesla non destructive magnetic field. In September 2018, researchers at the University of Tokyo generated a field of 1200 T which lasted in the order of 100 microseconds using the electromagnetic flux compression technique.  Definition A particle, carrying a charge of one coulomb, and moving perpendicularly through a magnetic field of one tesla, at a speed of one metre per second, experiences a force with magnitude one newton, according to the Lorentz force law. As an SI derived unit, the tesla can also be expressed as         T                          V                           s                     m              2                                        N                           s                     C                           m                               N             A                           m                               J             A                                m               2                                    Wb             m              2                               kg             A                                s               2                          displaystyle text T  dfrac text V cdot text s  text m 2  dfrac text N cdot text s  text C cdot text m  dfrac text N  text A cdot text m  dfrac text J  text A cdot text m 2  dfrac text Wb  text m 2  dfrac text kg  text A cdot text s 2  .Where A ampere, C coulomb, kg kilogram, m metre, N newton, s second, V volt, J joule, and Wb weber  Electric vs. magnetic field In the production of the Lorentz force, the difference between electric fields and magnetic fields is that a force from a magnetic field on a charged particle is generally due to the charged particle's movement, while the force imparted by an electric field on a charged particle is not due to the charged particle's movement. This may be appreciated by looking at the units for each. The unit of electric field in the MKS system of units is newtons per coulomb, N C, while the magnetic field can be written as N . The dividing factor between the two types of field is metres per second , which is velocity. This relationship immediately highlights the fact that whether a static electromagnetic field is seen as purely magnetic, or purely electric, or some combination of these, is dependent upon one's reference frame .In ferromagnets, the movement creating the magnetic field is the electron spin . In a current carrying wire the movement is due to electrons moving through the wire .  Conversions One tesla is equivalent to: 10,000 G , used in the CGS system. Thus, 10 kG 1 T , and 1 G 10 4 T 100 T . 1,000,000,000  , used in geophysics. Thus, 1  1 nT . 42.6 MHz of the 1H nucleus frequency, in NMR. Thus, the magnetic field associated with NMR at 1 GHz is 23.5 T.One tesla is by definition equal to 1 V s m2.

            "text": "The Woolworth Building is an early American skyscraper designed by architect Cass Gilbert located at 233 Broadway in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1930, with a height of 792 feet . More than a century after its construction, it remains one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States. The Woolworth Building is bounded by Broadway and City Hall Park to its east, Park Place to its north, and Barclay Street to its south. It consists of a 30 story base topped by a 30 story tower. Its facade is mostly decorated with architectural terracotta, though the lower portions are limestone, and it features thousands of windows. The ornate lobby contains various sculptures, mosaics, and architectural touches. The structure was designed with several amenities and attractions, including a now closed observatory on the 57th floor and a private swimming pool in the basement. F. W. Woolworth, the founder of a brand of popular five and ten cent stores, conceived the skyscraper as a headquarters for his company. Woolworth planned the skyscraper jointly with the Irving National Exchange Bank, which also agreed to use the structure as its headquarters. The Woolworth Building had originally been planned as a 12 to 16 story commercial building but underwent several revisions during its planning process. Its final height was not decided upon until January 1911. Construction started in 1910 and was completed two years later. The building officially opened on April 24, 1913. The Woolworth Building has undergone several changes throughout its history. The facade was cleaned in 1932, and the building received an extensive renovation between 1977 and 1981. The Irving National Exchange Bank moved its headquarters to 1 Wall Street in 1931, but the Woolworth Company continued to own the Woolworth Building for most of the 20th century. The structure was sold to the Witkoff Group in 1998. The top 30 floors were sold to a developer in 2012 and converted into residences. Office and commercial tenants use the rest of the building. The Woolworth Building has been a National Historic Landmark since 1966, and a New York City designated landmark since 1983.  Architecture Cass Gilbert designed the Woolworth Building in the neo Gothic style. The building resembles European Gothic cathedrals; Reverend S. Parkes Cadman dubbed it The Cathedral of Commerce in a booklet published in 1916. F. W. Woolworth, who had devised the idea for the Woolworth Building, had proposed to Gilbert that the Victoria Tower could be a model for the building. Conversely, Gilbert disliked the comparison to religious imagery. The architect ultimately used 15th and 16th century Gothic ornament on the Woolworth Building, along with a complementary color scheme.The Woolworth Building was designed to be 420 feet high but was eventually raised to 792 feet . Several different height measurements have been cited over the years, but the building rises about 793.5 feet above the lowest point of the site. The Woolworth Building was 60 stories tall when completed in 1913, though this consisted of 53 usable floors topped by several mechanical floors. The building's ceiling heights, ranging from 11 to 20 feet , make it the equivalent of an 80 story building. It remained the tallest building in the world until the construction of 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building in 1930, both in New York City. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10279; it was one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that had their own ZIP Codes as of 2019.  Form  The building's tower, flush with the main frontage on Broadway, joins an office block base with a narrow interior court for light. The base occupies the entire lot between Park Place to the north, Broadway to the east, and Barclay Street to the south. The base contains two wings extending westward, one each on the Park Place and Barclay Street frontages, which form a rough U shape when combined with the Broadway frontage. This ensured that all offices had outside views. The U shaped base is approximately 30 stories tall. All four elevations of the base are decorated, since it could be seen from all sides.The tower rises an additional 30 stories above the eastern side of the base, abutting Broadway. Above the 30th floor are setbacks on the north and south elevations. There are additional setbacks along the north, south, and west elevations on the 45th and 50th floors. The 30th through 45th floors measure 84 by 86 feet ; the 46th through 50th floors, 69 by 71 feet ; and the 51st through 53rd floors, 69 by 61 feet . The tower has a square plan below the 50th story setback and an octagonal plan above. Though the structure is physically 60 stories tall, the 53rd floor is the top floor that can be occupied. Above the 53rd floor, the tower tapers into a pyramidal roof.  Facade  The lowest four stories are clad in limestone. Above that, the exterior of the Woolworth Building was cast in limestone colored, glazed architectural terracotta panels. F. W. Woolworth initially wanted to clad the skyscraper in granite, while Gilbert wanted to use limestone. The decision to use terracotta for the facade was based on both aesthetic and functional concerns. Terracotta was not only fireproof but also, in Gilbert's mind, a purely ornamental addition clarifying the Woolworth Building's steel construction. Each panel was of a slightly different color, creating a polychrome effect. The facade appeared to have a uniform tone, but the upper floors were actually darker and more dense. Behind the terracotta panels were brick walls; the terracotta pieces are attached to the brick walls by metal rods and hangers.The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company provided the original terracotta cladding. The panels were manufactured in shades of blue, green, sienna, and rose. The terracotta panels were partially vitrified, allowing them to bear large loads. Gilbert also asked that John Donnelly and Eliseo V. Ricci create full size designs based on Atlantic Terra Cotta's models. In 1932, Atlantic Terra Cotta carried out a comprehensive cleaning campaign of the Woolworth's facade to remove blackening caused by the city's soot and pollution. The Ehrenkrantz Group restored the building's facade between 1977 and 1981. During the renovation, much of the terracotta was replaced with concrete and Gothic ornament was removed.The building has several thousand windows: the exact number is disputed, but various sources state that the Woolworth Building has 2,843, 4,400, or 5,000 windows. Windows were included for lighting and comfort; because the Woolworth Building was built before air conditioning became common, every office is within 10 feet of a window. Some of the Woolworth Building's windows are set within arch shaped openings. Most of the building's spandrels, or triangles between the top corners of the window and the top of the arch, have golden Gothic tracery against a bright blue backdrop. On the 25th, 39th, and 40th stories, the spandrels consist of iconography found in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Gold on blue tracery is also found on the 26th, 27th, and 42nd floors.  Base  On the part of the base facing Broadway, as well as the tower above it, there are three bays; the left and right bays have two windows per floor, while the center bay has three windows. The elevations facing Park Place and Barclay Street each have six bays with two windows per floor. The base, on its lowest four stories, is divided into three story high entrance and exit bays, each of which has a one story attic above it. There are nine entrances in total.The main entrance on Broadway is a three story Tudor arch, surrounded on either side by two bays: one narrower than the main arch, the other wider. The five bays form a triumphal arch overhung by a balcony and stone motifs of Gothic design. The intrados of the arch contains 23 niches. The topmost niche depicts an owl; the lowest niches on both sides depict tree trunks; and the other twenty niches depict animated figures. The spandrel above the left side of the arch depicts Mercury, classical god of commerce, while that above the right side depicts Ceres, classical goddess of agriculture. Above all of this is an ogee arch with more niches, as well as two carvings of owls hovering above a W monogram. There are salamanders within niches on either side of the main entrance. Inside the triumphal arch, there is a smaller arch with a revolving door and a Tudor window; it is flanked by standard doors and framed with decorations. There is a pelican above this smaller arch.Decorated revolving doors are also located at the northern and southern entrances, at Park Place and Barclay Street respectively. The Park Place and Barclay Street entrances are nearly identical, except for the arrangement of the storefronts. Both entrances are located on the eastern sides of their respective elevations, lining up with the tower above them, and contain a wide arch flanked by two narrower arches. The three entrances feed into the arcaded lobby. The building's Park Place entrance contained a stair to the New York City Subway's Park Place station, served by the 2 and 3 trains, inside the westernmost bay of the building entrance.The facade contains vertical piers, which protrude diagonally. There are six such piers on the Broadway elevation. In addition, horizontal belt courses run above the 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, and 24th stories. The 25th and 26th stories, above the topmost belt course, are separated by dark bronze spandrels. The 27th floor contains a canopy of projecting terracotta ogee arches. These decorative features make the tower section appear to merge with the atmosphere , as architectural writer Donald Reynolds described it. Above the 28th floor, a two story tall copper roof with complex tracery in the Gothic style tops the canopies. The 29th and 30th stories of the north and south wings are of similar depth to the six narrow bays on the Park Place and Barclay Street elevations but contain five bays. A small tower with three bays caps these wings.  Tower section  The 30th through 45th floors contain three bays on each elevation; the side bays contain two windows, while the center bay contains three windows. The 46th through 53rd floors also have three bays on each elevation, but the side bays only contain one window. At the 45th and 50th story setbacks, there are turrets at each corner of the tower. The northeast corner turret concealed a smokestack.There is a pyramidal roof above the 53rd floor, as well as four ornamental tourelles at the four corners of the tower. The roof was originally gilt but is now green. The pyramidal roof, as well as the smaller roofs below, used 40,000 square feet of gold leaf. The main roof is interspersed with small dormers, which contain windows into the maintenance levels inside. The pyramidal roof is topped by another pyramid with an octagonal base and tall pointed arch windows. In turn, the octagonal pyramid is capped by a spire. The three layers of pyramids are about 62 feet , or five stories tall. An observation deck was located at the 55th floor, about 730 feet above ground level. It was patronized by an estimated 300,000 visitors per year but was closed as a security measure in 1941 after the Pearl Harbor attack.  Structural features  Engineers Gunvald Aus and Kort Berle designed the steel frame, supported on massive caissons that penetrate to the bedrock. To give the structure a sturdy foundation, the builders used metal tubes 19 feet in diameter filled with concrete. These tubes were driven into the ground with a pneumatic caisson process to anchor the foundations to the bedrock. The underlying bedrock is an average of 110 or 115 feet deep, and the 69 caissons range in depth from 100 to 120 feet . Because the slope of the bedrock was so sharp, steps had to be carved into the rock before the caissons could be sunk into the ground. The caissons were both round and rectangular, with the rectangular caissons located mainly on the southern and western lot lines. Where the superstructure's columns did not match up with the caissons, they were cantilevered above on plate girders between two adjoining caissons. Each column carries a load of 24 short tons per square foot , supporting the building's overall weight of 233,000 short tons .For the wind bracing, the entire Woolworth Building was considered as a vertical cantilever, and correspondingly large girders and columns were used in the construction. Continuous portal bracing was used between the 1st and 28th floors, except in the interior columns, where triangular bracing was used. The portal braces on the building's exterior direct crosswinds downward toward the ground, rather than into the building. Interconnecting trusses were placed at five floor intervals between the tower and the wings; these, as well as the side and court walls, provided the bracing for the wings. Above the 28th floor, knee braces and column girder connections were used; hollow tile floors were installed because it would have taken too long to set the concrete floors, especially during cold weather. The two basement levels used reinforced concrete.Strongly articulated piers, which carry right to the pyramidal cap without intermediate cornices, give the building its upward thrust. This was influenced by Aus's belief that, From an engineering point of view, no structure is beautiful where the lines of strength are not apparent. The copper roof is connected to the Woolworth Building's steel superstructure, which serves to ground the roof electrically. The Gothic detailing concentrated at the highly visible crown is over scaled, and the building's silhouette could be made out from several miles away. Gilbert's choice of the Gothic style was described as an expression of the verticality of the tower form , and as Gilbert himself later wrote, the style was light, graceful, delicate and flame like .When the Woolworth Building was being erected, Gilbert considered several proposals for exterior lighting to emphasize the structure's form and size. These included placing four powerful searchlights atop nearby buildings and a constantly rotating lamp at the apex of the Woolworth Building's roof. Ultimately, the builders decided to erect nitrogen lamps and reflectors above the 31st floor, and have the intensity of the lighting increase with height.  Interior  Upon completion, the Woolworth Building contained seven water systems one each for the power plant, the hot water plant, the fire protection system, the communal restrooms, the offices with restrooms, the basement swimming pool and the basement restaurant. There are water tanks on the 14th, 27th, 28th, 50th, and 53rd floors. Although the water is obtained from the New York City water supply system, much of it is filtered and reused. A dedicated water system, separate from the city's, was proposed during construction, but workers abandoned the plan after unsuccessfully digging 1,500 feet into Manhattan's bedrock.The Woolworth Building was the first structure to have its own power plant with four Corliss steam engine generators totaling a capacity of 1,500 kilowatt hours ; the plant could support 50,000 people. The building also had a dedicated heating plant with six boilers with a capacity of 2,500 horsepower . The boilers were fed from subterranean coal bunkers capable of holding over 2,000 tons of anthracite coal.  Lobby  The ornate, cruciform lobby, known as the arcade , was characterized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as one of the most spectacular of the early 20th century in New York City . It consists of two perpendicular, double height passageways with barrel vaulted ceilings. One passageway runs between the arcade's west wing at the Woolworth Building's staircase hall and the east wing at Broadway. The other runs between the north wing at Park Place and the south wing at Barclay Street. A mezzanine crosses the arcade's north and south wings. Where the passageways intersect, there is a domed ceiling. The dome contains pendentives that may have been patterned after those of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia. The walls of this intersection vault are laid out in an octagonal shape, with mailboxes at the four intercardinal directions. Veined marble from the island of Skyros in Greece covers the lobby. Edward F. Caldwell Co. provided the interior lights for the lobby and hallways. Patterned glass mosaics that contain blue, green, and gold tiling with red accents decorate the ceilings. There are other Gothic style decorations in the lobby, including on the cornice and the bronze fittings. Twelve plaster brackets, which carry grotesques depicting major figures in the building's construction, are placed where the arcade and the mezzanine intersect. These ornaments include Gilbert with a model of the building, Aus taking a girder's measurements, and Woolworth holding nickels and dimes. Two ceiling murals by C. Paul Jennewein, titled Labor and Commerce, are located above the mezzanine where it crosses the south and north wings, respectively.The staircase hall is a two story room located to the west of the arcade. It consists of the ground level, which contains former storefronts, as well as a mezzanine level above it. A 15 foot wide marble staircase leads westward from the arcade to a mezzanine, where the entrance to the Irving National Exchange Bank office was formerly located. The mezzanine contains a stained glass skylight surrounded by the names of several nations. The skylight contains the dates 1879 and 1913, which respectively signify the years of the Woolworth Company's founding and the building's opening. The skylight is also surrounded by sculpted grotesques, which depict merchandising activities in the five and dime industry.There is a smaller space west of the staircase hall with a one story high ceiling. This room contains a coffered ceiling with a blue green background. The crossbeams contain Roman portrait heads, while the cornice contains generic sculpted grotesques. The lobby also contains a set of German chimes designed by Harry Yerkes.  Basement  The basement of the Woolworth Building contains an unused bank vault, restaurant, and barbershop. The bank vault was initially intended to be used for safe deposit boxes, though it was used by the Irving National Exchange Bank in practice. In 1931, Irving moved some 3 billion of deposits to a vault in its new headquarters at 1 Wall Street, and the Woolworth Building's vault was converted into a storage area for maintenance workers.The basement also contains closed entrances to two New York City Subway stations. There was an entrance to the Park Place station directly adjacent to the building's northelevation, served by the 2 and 3 trains. This entrance was closed after the September 11 attacks. Another entrance led to the City Hall station one block north, now served by the R and W trains, but this was closed in 1982 because of concerns over crime. The area in front of the former entrances is now used to store bikes.A private pool, originally intended for F. W. Woolworth, exists in the basement. Proposed as early as 1910, the pool measured 15 by 55 feet and was later drained. It was restored in the mid 2010s as part of the conversion of the Woolworth Building's upper floors into residential units.  Offices  At the time of construction, the Woolworth Building had over 2,000 offices. Each office had ceilings ranging from 11 to 20 feet high. Gilbert had designed the interior to maximize the amount of usable office space, and correspondingly, minimize the amount of space taken up by the elevator shafts. The usable space consideration affected the placement of the columns in the wings; the columns in the main tower were positioned according to the location of the elevator shafts and facade piers.Woolworth's private office on the 24th floor, revetted in green marble in the French Empire style, is preserved in its original condition. His office included a mahogany desk with a leather top measuring 7.5 by 3.75 feet . The marble columns in the office are capped by gilded Corinthian capitals. Woolworth's reception room contained objects that were inspired by a visit to the Ch teau de Compi gne shortly after the building opened. These included a bronze bust of Napoleon, a set of French Empire style lamps with gold figures, and an inkwell with a depiction of Napoleon on horseback.  Elevators  The Woolworth Building contains a system of high speed elevators capable of traveling 650 feet or 700 feet per minute. The Otis Elevator Company supplied the units, which were innovative in that there were express elevators, stopping only at certain floors, and local elevators, stopping at every floor between a certain range. There were 26 Otis electric elevators with gearless traction, as well as an electric drum shuttle elevator within the tower once construction was complete.The elevators are accessed from bays in the eastern and western walls of the arcade. The walls are both divided by two bays with round arches, and there are four elevators on each wall. The elevator doors in the lobby were designed by Tiffany Studios. The patterns on the doors have been described as arabesque tracery patterns in etched steel set off against a gold plated background .  History   Planning  F. W. Woolworth, an entrepreneur who had become successful because of his Five and Dime , began planning a new headquarters for the F. W. Woolworth Company in 1910. Around the same time, Woolworth's friend Lewis Pierson was having difficulty getting shareholder approval for the merger of his Irving National Bank and the rival New York Exchange Bank. Woolworth offered to acquire shares in New York Exchange Bank and vote in favor of the merger if Pierson agreed to move the combined banks' headquarters to a new building he was planning as the F. W. Woolworth Company's headquarters. Having received a commitment from the banks, Woolworth acquired a corner site on Broadway and Park Place in Lower Manhattan, opposite City Hall. The entrepreneur briefly considered purchasing a plot at West Broadway and Reade Street, a few blocks north of the Woolworth Building's current site. Woolworth decided against it because of the prestige that a Broadway address provided .Woolworth and the Irving National Exchange Bank then set up the Broadway Park Place Company to construct and finance the proposed structure. Initially, the bank was supposed to purchase the company's stock gradually until it owned the entire company, and thus, the Woolworth Building. Irving would be able to manage the 18 floors of rentable space on a 25 year lease. While negotiations to create the Broadway Park Place Company were ongoing, Woolworth and his real estate agent Edward J. Hogan purchased several parcels from the Trenor Luther Park estate and other owners. The entire footprint of the current building, a rectangular lot, had been acquired by April 15, 1910, at a total cost of 1.65 million.  Original designs  Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the new building. There are few print documents that indicate early correspondence between Woolworth and Gilbert, and news articles as late as March 1910 mentioned that no architect had been chosen. Gilbert later mentioned that he had received the commission for the Woolworth Building after getting a phone call from Woolworth one day. The architect had recently finished designing the nearby Broadway Chambers Building and 90 West Street, whose architecture Woolworth admired. Woolworth wanted his new structure to be of similar design to the Palace of Westminster in London, which was designed in the Gothic style. At the time, Gilbert was well known for constructing modern skyscrapers with historicizing design elements.Gilbert was originally retained to design a standard 12 to 16 story commercial building for Woolworth, who later said he had no desire to erect a monument that would cause posterity to remember me . However, Woolworth then wanted to surpass the nearby New York World Building, which sat on the other side of City Hall Park and stood 20 stories and 350 feet . A drawing by Thomas R. Johnson, dated April 22, 1910, shows a 30 story building rising from the site. Because of the change in plans, the organization of the Broadway Park Place Company was rearranged. Woolworth would now be the major partner, contributing 1 million of the planned 1.5 million cost. The Irving Bank would pay the balance, and it would take up a 25 year lease for the ground floor, fourth floor, and basement.By September 1910, Gilbert had designed an even taller structure, with a 40 story tower on Park Place adjacent to a shorter 25 story annex, yielding a 550 foot tall building. The next month, Gilbert's latest design had evolved into a 45 story tower roughly the height of the nearby Singer Building. After the latest design, Woolworth wrote to Gilbert in November 1910 and asked for the building's height to be increased to 620 feet , which was 8 feet taller than the Singer Building, Lower Manhattan's tallest building. Woolworth was inspired by his travels in Europe, where he would constantly be asked about the Singer Building. He decided that housing his company in an even taller building would provide invaluable advertising for the F. W. Woolworth Company and make it renowned worldwide. This design, unveiled to the public the same month, was a 45 story tower rising 625 feet , sitting on a lot by 105 by 197 feet . Referring to the revised plans, Woolworth said, I do not want a mere building. I want something that will be an ornament to the city. He later said that he wanted visitors to brag that they had visited the world's tallest building. Louis J. Horowitz, president of the building's main contractor Thompson Starrett Company, said of Woolworth, Beyond a doubt his ego was a thing of extraordinary size; whoever tried to find a reason for his tall building and did not take that fact into account would reach a false conclusion.   Plans for world's tallest building  Even after the revised height was unveiled, Woolworth still yearned to make the building even taller as it was now close to the 700 foot height of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, then the tallest building in New York City and the world. On December 20, 1910, Woolworth sent a team of surveyors to measure the Metropolitan Life Tower's height and come up with a precise measurement, so he could make his skyscraper 50 feet taller. He then ordered Gilbert to revise the building's design to reach 710 or 712 feet , despite ongoing worries over whether the additional height would be worth the increased cost. In order to fit the larger base that a taller tower necessitated, Woolworth bought the remainder of the frontage on Broadway between Park Place and Barclay Street. He also purchased two lots to the west, one on Park Place and one on Barclay Street; these lots would not be developed, but would retain their low rise buildings and preserve the proposed tower's views. Such a tall building would produce the largest income of any building globally.On January 1, 1911, the New York Times reported Woolworth was planning a 625 feet building at a cost of 5 million. By January 18, 1911, Woolworth and Hogan had acquired the final site for the project at a total cost of 4.5 million; the lot measured 152 feet on Broadway, 192.5 feet on Barclay Street, and 197.83 feet on Park Place. In a New York Times article two days later, Woolworth said that his building would rise 750 feet to its tip. In order to fit the correct architectural proportions, Gilbert redesigned the building to its current 792 foot height. Renderings by illustrator Hughson Hawley, completed in April 1911, are the first official materials that reflect this final height.Gilbert had to reconcile both Woolworth's and Pierson's strict requirements for the design of the structure. The architect's notes describe late night conversations that he had with both men. The current design of the lobby, with its arcade, reflected these conflicting pressures. Sometimes, Gilbert also faced practical conundrums, such as Woolworth's requirement that there be many windows so divided that all of the offices should be well lighted , and so that tenants could erect partitions to fit their needs. Gilbert wrote this naturally prevented any broad wall space . Woolworth and Gilbert sometimes clashed during the design process, especially because of the constantly changing designs and the architect's fees. Nevertheless, Gilbert commended Woolworth's devotion to the details and beauty of the building's design, as well as the entrepreneur's enthusiasm for the project. Such was the scale of the building that, for several years, Gilbert's sense of scale was destroyed ... because of the unprecedented attuning of detail to, for these days, such an excessive height .  Construction  In September 1910, wrecking crews demolished the five and six story structures which previously occupied the site. Construction officially began on November 4, 1910, with excavation by The Foundation Company, using a contract negotiated personally by Frank Woolworth. The start of construction instantly raised the site's value from 2.25 million to 3.2 million. The contract of over 1 million was described as the largest contract for foundation construction ever awarded in the world.It took months for Woolworth to decide upon the general construction company. George A. Fuller's Fuller Company was well experienced and had practically invented skyscraper construction, but Louis Horowitz's Thompson Starrett Company was local to New York; despite being newer, Horowitz had worked for Fuller before, and thus had a similar knowledge base. On April 20, 1911, Thompson Starrett won the contract with a guaranteed construction price of 4,308,500 for the building's frame and structural elements. The company was paid 300,000 for their oversight and management work, despite Woolworth's attempts to get the company to do the job for free due to the prestige of the project. On June 12, 1911, the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company received a 250,000 contract to manufacture the terracotta. The next month, Donnelly and Ricci received the 11,500 contract for the terracotta work and some of the interior design work. Gilbert requested Atlantic Terra Cotta use an office next to his while they drew several hundred designs.The construction process involved hundreds of workers, and daily wages ranged from 1.50 for laborers to 4.50 for skilled workers . By August 1911, the building's foundations were completed ahead of the target date of September 15; construction of the skyscraper's steel frame began August 15. The steel beams and girders used in the framework weighed so much that, to prevent the streets from caving in, a group of surveyors examined them on the route along which the beams would be transported. The American Bridge Company provided steel for the building from their foundries in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; manufacturing took over 45 weeks. The first above ground steel had been erected by October 1911, and installation of the building's terracotta began on February 1, 1912. The building rose at the rate of 1 1 2 stories a week and the steelworkers set a speed record for assembling 1,153 tons of steel in six consecutive eight hour days. By February 18, 1912, work on the steel frame had reached the building's 18th floor. By April 6, 1912, the steel frame had reached the top of the base at the 30th floor and work then began on constructing the tower of the Woolworth Building. Steel reached the 47th floor by May 30 and the official topping out ceremony took place two weeks ahead of schedule on July 1, 1912, as the last rivet was driven into the summit of the tower. The skyscraper was substantially completed by the end of that year.  Opening and early years   Opening ceremony  The building opened on April 24, 1913. Woolworth held a grand dinner on the building's 27th floor for over 900 guests, and at exactly 7:30 p.m. EST, President Woodrow Wilson pushed a button in Washington, D.C., to turn on the building's lights. Attendees included: Francis Hopkinson Smith, who served as toastmaster; author William Winter; businessmen Patrick Francis Murphy and Charles M. Schwab; Rhode Island Governor Aram J. Pothier; Judge Thomas C. T. Crain; US Senator from Arkansas Joseph Taylor Robinson; Ecuadorian minister Gonzalo C rdova; New York Supreme Court Justices Charles L. Guy and Edward Everett McCall; Commissioner of Education of the State of New York John Huston Finley; Collector of the Port of New York William Loeb Jr.; naval architect Lewis Nixon; Rear Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee; Commissioner of Docks and Ferries of the City of New York R. A. C. Smith; Colonel William Conant Church; United States Representative from New York Herman A. Metz; New York City Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo; banker James Speyer; former Lieutenant Governor of New York Timothy L. Woodruff; writer Robert Sterling Yard; Admiral Albert Gleaves; and reportedly between 69 and 80 congressmen who arrived via a special train from Washington, DC. Additional congratulations were sent via letter from former President William Howard Taft, Governor of New Jersey James Fairman Fielder and United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.On completion, the Woolworth Building topped the record set by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower as the world's tallest building, a distinction it held until 1930. The final estimated construction cost was US 13.5 million , up from the initial estimates of US 5 million for the shorter versions of the skyscraper . This was divided into 5 million for the land, 1 million for the foundation, and 7 million for the structure. Woolworth provided 5 million, while investors provided the remainder, and financing was completed by August 1911. By May 1914, Woolworth had purchased all of the Broadway Park Place Company's shares from the Irving National Exchange Bank. Though Woolworth owned the building, his company did not. The building contained offices for as many as 14,000 employees.  Early tenants  The building was declared ready for occupancy on May 1, 1913, and Woolworth began advertising the offices for rent beginning at 4.00 per square foot. To attract tenants, Woolworth hired architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler to write a 56 page brochure outlining the building's features. Schuyler later described the Woolworth Building as the noblest offspring of buildings erected with steel skeletons. By the end of 1914, the building was 70 occupied and generating over 1.3 million a year in rents for the F. W. Woolworth Company. By the 1920s, the building had more than a thousand different tenants, who generally occupied suites of one or two rooms. These tenants reportedly collectively employed over 12,000 people who worked within the building.In 1920, after F. W. Woolworth died, his heirs took out a 3 million mortgage loan on the Woolworth Building from Prudential Life Insurance Company to pay off 8 million in inheritance tax. By this point, the building was worth 10 million and grossed 1.55 million per year in rent income. The Broadway Park Place Corporation sold the building to Woolco Realty Co., a subsidiary of the F. W. Woolworth Company, in April 1924 for 11 million. The company paid 4 million in cash and obtained a five year, 11 million mortgage from Prudential Life Insurance Company at an annual interest rate of 5.5 .During World War I, only one of the Woolworth Building's then 14 elevators was turned on, and many lighting fixtures in hallways and offices were turned off. This resulted in about a 70 energy reduction compared to peacetime requirements. This policy was reinstated during World War II: ten of the building's 24 elevators were temporarily disabled in 1944 because of a shortage of coal.In 1927, the building's pinnacle was painted green and the observation tower was regilded in gold at a cost of over 25,000. The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company cleaned the Woolworth Building's facade in 1932. By 1953, a new chilled water air conditioning system had been installed, bringing individual room temperature control to a third of the building. The old car switch control elevators had been replaced with a new automatic dispatching systems and new elevator cars. However, the building's terracotta facade deteriorated easily, and by 1962, repairs to the terracotta tiles were occurring year round.  Restoration, landmark status, and sale  The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission considered giving the Woolworth Building official city landmark status in 1970. The F. W. Woolworth Company called the landmark law onerous since it would restrict the company from making modifications to many aspects of the building. The commission ultimately declined to give the Woolworth Building a designated landmark status because of the company's opposition to such a measure, as well as the increased costs and scrutiny. The F. W. Woolworth Company commissioned an appraisal of the building's facade in 1975 and found serious deterioration in the building's terracotta. Many of the blocks of terracotta had loosened or cracked from the constant thermal expansion and contraction caused by New York's climate. The cracks in the facade let in rain, which caused the steel superstructure to rust.In 1977, the F. W. Woolworth Company began a five year restoration of the building's terracotta and limestone facade, as well as replacement of all the building's windows. Initially, the company had considered replacing the entire terracotta facade with concrete to prevent further deterioration, but backed away from the plan due to cost and potential backlash from preservationists. The renovation involved the replacement of roughly one fifth of the building's terracotta surface. as well as all of the building's windows, by Turner Construction under a plan by the New York architectural firm Ehrenkrantz Group. Since terracotta had become rare in the 1970s, few manufacturers remained to supply replacement tiles, so the company replaced 26,000 of the tiles with concrete lookalikes; many of those tiles had to be custom cut. The concrete was coated with a surface that was meant to be replaced at five year intervals, a similar replacement cycle to the glaze on the terracotta blocks. Similarly, the original copper windows were replaced with aluminum frames which allowed them to be opened, whereas the originals were sealed in place. The company also removed some decorative flying buttresses near the tower's crown and refaced four tourelles in aluminum because of damage.The renovation was completed in 1982. When the work began, it was expected to cost just 8 million, but the final cost was over 22 million. Much of the renovation was financed through an 11.4 million tax break from the New York City government. The same year the renovation was completed, the building's entrance to the City Hall subway station was closed because of fears over crime. A year later, in 1983, the Landmarks Preservation Commission revisited the building and granted landmark protection to its exterior and facade. The building was owned by the F. W. Woolworth Company until 1998. After struggling financially for years, and with no need for a trophy office building, Venator Group began discussing a sale of the building in 1996.  Witkoff Group ownership  Venator Group sold the building in June 1998 to Steve Witkoff's Witkoff Group and Lehman Brothers for 155 million. The F. W. Woolworth Company shrunk its space in the building from eight floors to four; this was a sharp contrast to the 25 floors the company had occupied at its peak. Witkoff also agreed to license the Woolworth name and invest 30 million in renovating the exterior and interior of the building. After purchasing the building, the Witkoff Group rebranded it in an attempt to attract entertainment and technology companies. In April 2000, the Venator Group officially moved their headquarters out of the building to 112 West 34th Street. In October 2000, the company proposed a 2 story addition to the 29th floor setbacks on the north and southelevations of the tower, to be designed by Skidmore, Owings Merrill, who were also leading the renovation of the building. However, the proposal was unanimously voted down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.The company unveiled an ambitious plan in November 2000 that would have converted the top 27 floors of the building into 75 condominiums, including a five story penthouse. The plan would have included a new residential lobby on Park Place, a 100 space garage, a 75 seat underground screening room, and a spa in the basement. The developers planned to spend 60 to 70 million on the conversion and to be ready for occupancy by August 2002. However, the Landmarks Preservation Commission opposed the plan because it would have required exterior changes to the roof. The commission eventually approved a version of the plan. Following the September 11 attacks, and the subsequent collapse of the nearby World Trade Center, the status of the plan was in doubt, and the proposal was later canceled.Prior to the September 11 attacks, the World Trade Center was often photographed in such a way that the Woolworth Building could be seen between the complex's twin towers. After the attacks occurred only a few blocks away, the Woolworth Building was without electricity, water and telephone service for a few weeks; its windows were broken, and falling rubble damaged a top turret. Increased post attack security restricted access to most of the ornate lobby, previously a tourist attraction. New York Times reporter David W. Dunlap wrote in 2006 that a security guard had asked him to leave within twelve seconds of entering the Woolworth Building. However, there was renewed interest in restoring public access to the Woolworth Building during planning for its centennial celebrations. The lobby reopened to public tours in 2014, when Woolworth Tours started accommodating groups for 30 to 90 minute tours. The tours were part of a partnership between Cass Gilbert's great granddaughter, Helen Post Curry, and Witkoff's vice president for development, Roy A. Suskin.In June 2003, Credit Suisse First Boston provided 201 million in financing for the property spread across a 125.4 million senior loan, a 49.6 million junior interest and a 26 million mezzanine loan. In April 2005, Bank of America provided a 250 million commercial mortgage backed security interest only loan on the office portion of the building. At the time, the building was 96 occupied, appraised at 320 million, and generated almost 18 million a year in net operating income.By 2007, the concrete blocks on the Woolworth Building's facade had deteriorated because of neglect. A lack of regular re surfacing had led to water and dirt absorption, which stained the concrete blocks. Though terracotta's popularity had increased since the 1970s, Suskin had declined to say whether the facade would be modified, if at all. Around the same time, Witkoff planned to partner with Rubin Schron to create an office club on the top 25 floors building to attract high end tenants like hedge funds and private equity firms. The plan would have restored the 58th floor observatory as a private amenity for office club tenants, in addition to amenities like a private dining room, meeting rooms, and a new dedicated lobby. The partners planned to complete the project by the end of 2008, but the financial crisis of 2007 2008 derailed the plans, leaving the top floors gutted and vacant.  Residential conversion  On July 31, 2012, an investment group led by New York developer Alchemy Properties which included Adam Neumann and Joel Schreiber, bought the top 30 floors of the skyscraper for 68 million from the Witkoff Group and Cammeby's International. The firm planned to renovate the space into 33 luxury apartments and convert the penthouse into a five level living space. The lower 28 floors are still owned by the Witkoff Group and Cammeby's International, who planned to maintain them as office space. The project was expected to cost approximately 150 million including the 68 million purchase price. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the changes to the building in October 2013.The renovation included many restorations and changes to the building's interior. Two of the elevator shafts only went to the 29th floor, allowing extra floor space for the residents above. A new private lobby was also built for residents and the coffered ceiling from F.W. Woolworth's personal 40th floor office was relocated to the entryway. Thierry Despont and Eve Robinson designed the building's new interiors with Miele appliances and custom cabinetry. Each unit also received space in a wine cellar, along with access to the restored private pool in the basement. The 29th floor was converted to an amenity floor named the Gilbert Lounge after the structure's architect, while the 30th floor hosts a fitness facility.In August 2014, the New York Attorney General's office approved Alchemy's plan to sell 34 condos at the newly branded Woolworth Tower Residences for a combined total of 443.7 million. The 110 million price tag for the building's penthouse unit, dubbed The Pinnacle , was the highest asking price ever for an apartment in downtown Manhattan. If sold, the unit would have surpassed the record 50.9 million penthouse at Ralph Thomas Walker's Walker Tower, and even the 100.5 million record price for a Manhattan penthouse set by Michael Dell at Extell's One57 in 2014. In 2019, the still vacant penthouse's asking price was reduced to 79 million.After a soft launch in late 2014, units at the building were officially listed for sale in mid 2015. Alchemy initially intended to leverage an in house sales staff and hired a director from Corcoran Sunshine to lead the effort. However, the new sales director left at the end of 2015 for Extell Development Company amid rumors of slow sales at the project. Following his departure, the company hired Sotheby's International Realty to market the units. In June 2016, United Overseas Bank of Singapore provided a 220 million construction loan for the project.In 2015, The Blackstone Group provided a 320 million loan on the office portion of the building to refinance the maturing Bank of America loan from 2005. When the sale was first announced in 2012, the developers expected the building's conversion to be complete by 2015. However, construction of the conversion took longer than expected. Workers could not attach a construction hoist to the building's landmarked facade without damaging it, and they were prohibited from using the elevators because of the active office tenants on the lower floors and the regular public tours of the landmarked lobby. As a result, the conversion was expected to be completed by February or March 2019, about six and a half years after Alchemy bought the property. By February 2019, only three of the building's 31 condos had been sold, since the developers had refused to discount prices, despite a glut of new luxury apartments in New York City.  Tenants   Early tenants  On the building's completion, the F. W. Woolworth Company occupied only one and a half floors. However, as the owner, the Woolworth Company profited from renting space out to others. The Woolworth Building was almost always fully occupied because of its central location in Lower Manhattan, as well as its direct connections to two subway stations. The Irving Trust Company occupied the first four floors when the building opened. It had a large banking room on the second floor accessible directly from a grand staircase in the lobby, vaults in the basement, offices on the third floor mezzanine, and a boardroom on the fourth floor. In 1931, the company relocated their general, out of town, and foreign offices from the Woolworth Building after building their own headquarters at 1 Wall Street. Columbia Records was one of the Woolworth Building's tenants on opening day and housed a recording studio in the skyscraper. In 1917, Columbia made what are considered the first jazz recordings, by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, in this studio.Shortly after the building opened, several railroad companies rented space. The Union Pacific Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad occupied the ground floor retail space with ticket offices. Other railroad companies that leased office space included the Alton Railroad, on the 13th floor; the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad , on the 14th floor; the Canadian Pacific Railway, Great Northern Railway, and New York Central Railroad on the 15th floor; the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, on the 17th floor; the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, on the 19th floor; the Canadian Northern Railway; the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad; the Pennsylvania Railroad; the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway; the Kansas City Southern Railway; and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.The inventor Nikola Tesla also occupied an office in the Woolworth Building beginning in 1914; he was evicted after a year because he could not pay his rent. Scientific American moved into the building in 1915 before departing for Midtown Manhattan in 1926. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America was present at the building's opening, occupying the southern half of the 18th floor after signing a lease in January 1913. Other early tenants included the American Hardware Manufacturers Association headquarters, the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, Colt's Manufacturing Company, Remington Arms, Simmons Boardman Publishing headquarters, the Taft Peirce Manufacturing Company, and the Hudson Motor Car Company.  Later 20th century  By the 1920s, the building also hosted Newport News Shipbuilding and Nestl .In the 1930s, prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey maintained his offices in the building while investigating racketeering and organized crime in Manhattan. His office took up the entire fourteenth floor and was heavily guarded. The regional headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board also moved into the building in 1937, shortly after its founding in 1935. During World War II, the Kellex Corporation, part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, was based here.During the early 1960s, public relations expert Howard J. Rubenstein opened an office in the building. In 1975, the city signed a lease for state judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg's offices in the Woolworth Building.  Higher education  The structure has a long association with higher education, housing a number of Fordham University schools in the early 20th century. In 1916, Fordham created Fordham Downtown at the Woolworth Building by moving the School of Sociology and Social Service and the School of Law to the building. The Fordham University Graduate School was founded on the building's 28th floor in the same year and a new Teachers College quickly followed on the seventh floor. In September 1920, the Business School was also established on the seventh floor, originally as the School of Accounting. By 1929, the school's combined programs at the Woolworth Building had over 3,000 enrolled students. Between 1916 and 1943 the building was also home at various times to the Fordham College , a summer school, and the short lived School of Irish Studies. In 1943, the Graduate School relocated to Keating Hall at Fordham's Rose Hill campus in Fordham, Bronx, and the rest of the schools moved to nearby 302 Broadway because of reduced attendance because of World War II.The New York University School of Professional Studies' Center for Global Affairs leased 94,000 square feet on the second, third, and fourth floors in 2002 from defunct dot com startup FrontLine Capital Group. The American Institute of Graphic Arts also moved its headquarters in the Woolworth Building.  21st century tenants  By the early 2000s, the Woolworth Building was home to numerous technology tenants. Digital advertising firm Xceed occupied 65,000 square feet across four floors as its headquarters, Organic, Inc. took 112,000 square feet , and advertising agency Fallon Worldwide used two floors. However, Xceed terminated its lease in April 2001 during the midst of the Dot com bubble collapse in order to move to smaller offices in the Starrett Lehigh Building. One month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Northeast Regional Office at 7 World Trade Center was destroyed in the September 11 attacks, the commission's 334 employees moved into 140,000 square feet across five floors of the Woolworth Building. The Commission left for a larger space in Brookfield Place less than four years later in 2005. The General Services Administration took over the commission's space on November 1, 2005 and used it as offices for approximately 200 staff of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. Following the completion of renovations at the historic Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in late October 2017, both offices moved into newly vacated space in the nearby Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.The New York City Police Department pension fund signed a lease for 56,000 square feet on the 19th and 25th floors in April 2002. The pension fund renewed their lease for another 20 year term in October 2010. Starbucks opened a 1,500 square foot location on the ground floor in the spring of 2003. In 2006, Levitz Furniture moved its headquarters to the 23rd floor of the building from Woodbury, Long Island, after declaring bankruptcy a second time. The design firm Control Group Inc. leased an entire floor of the Woolworth Building in 2006.As of 2010, the Lawrence Group handles leasing at the Woolworth Building. In May 2013, SHoP Architects moved the company's headquarters to the building's entire 11th floor, occupying 30,500 square feet of space. In February 2016, the New York City Law Department leased the building's entire 32,000 square feet fifth floor for the Department's tort office. Joseph Altuzarra's namesake fashion brand, Altuzarra, signed on to occupy the 14th floor in June 2016. In November 2017, Thomas J. Watson's Watson Foundation signed a lease to relocate to the 27th floor of the building. In 2017, the New York Shipping Exchange moved into the 21st floor of the building. In May 2018, architecture and design firm CallisonRTKL signed a lease for the building's entire 28,100 square feet 16th floor. The Vera Institute of Justice left the building's 12th floor a few months later, moving into a larger space in Industry City, Brooklyn.  Impact  The Woolworth Building has had a large impact in architectural spheres, and has been featured in many works of popular culture, including photographs, prints, films, and literature. Before beginning construction, Woolworth hired New York photographer Irving Underhill to document the building's construction. These photographs were distributed to Woolworth's stores nationwide to generate enthusiasm for the project. During construction, Underhill, Wurts Brothers, and Tebbs Hymans each took photographs to document the structure's progression. These photos were often taken from close up views, or from far away to provide contrast against the surrounding structures. They were part of a media promotion for the Woolworth Building. Both contemporary and modern figures criticized the photos as 'standard solutions' at best and 'architectural eye candy' at worst . It was largely effective: in a 2001 book about Cass Gilbert, Mary N. Woods writes that the rich and varied afterlife of the Woolworth Building ... enhances Gilbert's accomplishment . Dirk Stichweh described the building as being the Mozart of skysrapers .One of the earliest films to feature the skyscraper was the 1921 film Manhatta , a short documentary film directed by painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. Since then, the building has made cameo appearances in several films for instance, the 1929 film Applause. It was also the setting of several film climaxes, such as in Enchanted , as well as used for the setting of major organizations, such as in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . The television show Ugly Betty used the Woolworth Building as the 'Meade Publications' building, a major location in the series. The Woolworth Building has also appeared in works of literature, such as Langston Hughes's 1926 poem Negro and the 2007 novel Peak. A one third scale replica of the Woolworth Building, the Lincoln American Tower in Memphis, Tennessee, was also built in 1924.

            "text": "The World's Columbian Exposition was a world's fair held in Chicago in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492. The centerpiece of the Fair, held in Jackson Park, was a large water pool representing the voyage Columbus took to the New World. Chicago had won the right to host the fair over several other cities, including New York City, Washington, D.C., and St. Louis. The exposition was an influential social and cultural event and had a profound effect on American architecture, the arts, American industrial optimism, and Chicago's image. The layout of the Chicago Columbian Exposition was, in large part, designed by John Wellborn Root, Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted and Charles B. Atwood. It was the prototype of what Burnham and his colleagues thought a city should be. It was designed to follow Beaux Arts principles of design, namely neoclassical architecture principles based on symmetry, balance, and splendor. The color of the material generally used to cover the buildings' fa ades gave the fairgrounds its nickname, the White City. Many prominent architects designed its 14 great buildings . Artists and musicians were featured in exhibits and many also made depictions and works of art inspired by the exposition. The exposition covered 690 acres , featuring nearly 200 new buildings of predominantly neoclassical architecture, canals and lagoons, and people and cultures from 46 countries. More than 27 million people attended the exposition during its six month run. Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other world's fairs, and it became a symbol of the emerging American Exceptionalism, much in the same way that the Great Exhibition became a symbol of the Victorian era United Kingdom. Dedication ceremonies for the fair were held on October 21, 1892, but the fairgrounds were not actually opened to the public until May 1, 1893. The fair continued until October 30, 1893. In addition to recognizing the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by Europeans, the fair also served to show the world that Chicago had risen from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire, which had destroyed much of the city in 1871.On October 9, 1893, the day designated as Chicago Day, the fair set a world record for outdoor event attendance, drawing 751,026 people. The debt for the fair was soon paid off with a check for 1.5 million . Chicago has commemorated the fair with one of the stars on its municipal flag.  History   Planning and organization  Many prominent civic, professional, and commercial leaders from around the United States participated in the financing, coordination, and management of the Fair, including Chicago shoe company owner Charles H. Schwab, Chicago railroad and manufacturing magnate John Whitfield Bunn, and Connecticut banking, insurance, and iron products magnate Milo Barnum Richardson, among many others.The fair was planned in the early 1890s during the Gilded Age of rapid industrial growth, immigration, and class tension. World's fairs, such as London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition, had been successful in Europe as a way to bring together societies fragmented along class lines. The first American attempt at a world's fair in Philadelphia in 1876 drew crowds, but was a financial failure. Nonetheless, ideas about distinguishing the 400th anniversary of Columbus' landing started in the late 1880s. Civic leaders in St. Louis, New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago expressed interest in hosting a fair to generate profits, boost real estate values, and promote their cities. Congress was called on to decide the location. New York financiers J. P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and William Waldorf Astor, among others, pledged 15 million to finance the fair if Congress awarded it to New York, while Chicagoans Charles T. Yerkes, Marshall Field, Philip Armour, Gustavus Swift, and Cyrus McCormick, Jr., offered to finance a Chicago fair. What finally persuaded Congress was Chicago banker Lyman Gage, who raised several million additional dollars in a 24 hour period, over and above New York's final offer.Chicago representatives not only fought for the world's fair for monetary reasons, but also for reasons of practicality. In a Senate hearing held in January 1890, representative Thomas Barbour Bryan argued that the most important qualities for a world's fair were abundant supplies of good air and pure water,...ample space, accommodations and transportation for all exhibits and visitors.... He argued that New York had too many obstructions, and Chicago would be able to use large amounts of land around the city where there was not a house to buy and not a rock to blast.... and that it would be so located that the artisan and the farmer and the shopkeeper and the man of humble means would be able to access the fair easily. Bryan continued to say that the fair was of vital interest to the West, and that the West wanted the location to be Chicago. The city spokesmen would continue to stress the essentials of a successful Exposition and that only Chicago was fit to fill these exposition requirements.The location of the fair was decided through several rounds of voting by the United States House of Representatives. The first ballot showed Chicago with a large lead over New York, St. Louis, and Washington, DC, but short of a majority. Chicago broke the 154 vote majority threshold on the eighth ballot, receiving 157 votes to New York's 107.The exposition corporation and national exposition commission settled on Jackson Park and an area around it as the fair site. Daniel H. Burnham was selected as director of works, and George R. Davis as director general. Burnham emphasized architecture and sculpture as central to the fair and assembled the period's top talent to design the buildings and grounds including Frederick Law Olmsted for the grounds. The temporary buildings were designed in an ornate Neoclassical style and painted white, resulting in the fair site being referred to as the White City .The Exposition's offices set up shop in the upper floors of the Rand McNally Building on Adams Street, the world's first all steel framed skyscraper. Davis's team organized the exhibits with the help of G. Brown Goode of the Smithsonian. The Midway was inspired by the 1889 Paris Universal Exposition, which included ethnological villages. Civil rights leaders protested the refusal to include an African American exhibit. Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Irvine Garland Penn, and Ferdinand Lee Barnet co authored a pamphlet entitled The Reason Why the Colored American is not in the World's Columbian Exposition The Afro American's Contribution to Columbian Literature addressing the issue. The exhibition included a number of exhibits put on by black individuals and approved by white organizers of the fair, including exhibits by the sculptor Edmonia Lewis, a painting exhibit by scientist George Washington Carver, and a statistical exhibit by Joan Imogen Howard. It also included blacks in white exhibits, such as Nancy Green's portrayal of the character Aunt Jemima for the R. T. Davis Milling Company.  Operation  The fair opened in May and ran through October 30, 1893. Forty six nations participated in the fair , constructing exhibits and pavilions and naming national delegates . The Exposition drew over 27 million visitors. The fair was originally meant to be closed on Sundays, but the Chicago Woman's Club petitioned that it stay open. The club felt that if the exposition was closed on Sunday, it would restrict those who could not take off work during the work week from seeing it.The exposition was located in Jackson Park and on the Midway Plaisance on 630 acres in the neighborhoods of South Shore, Jackson Park Highlands, Hyde Park, and Woodlawn. Charles H. Wacker was the director of the fair. The layout of the fairgrounds was created by Frederick Law Olmsted, and the Beaux Arts architecture of the buildings was under the direction of Daniel Burnham, Director of Works for the fair. Renowned local architect Henry Ives Cobb designed several buildings for the exposition. The director of the American Academy in Rome, Francis Davis Millet, directed the painted mural decorations. Indeed, it was a coming of age for the arts and architecture of the American Renaissance, and it showcased the burgeoning neoclassical and Beaux Arts styles.  Assassination of mayor and end of fair  The fair ended with the city in shock, as popular mayor Carter Harrison, Sr. was assassinated by Patrick Eugene Prendergast two days before the fair's closing. Closing ceremonies were canceled in favor of a public memorial service. Jackson Park was returned to its status as a public park, in much better shape than its original swampy form. The lagoon was reshaped to give it a more natural appearance, except for the straight line northern end where it still laps up against the steps on the south side of the Palace of Fine Arts Museum of Science Industry building. The Midway Plaisance, a park like boulevard which extends west from Jackson Park, once formed the southern boundary of the University of Chicago, which was being built as the fair was closing . The university's football team, the Maroons, were the original Monsters of the Midway. The exposition is mentioned in the university's alma mater: The City White hath fled the earth, But where the azure waters lie, A nobler city hath its birth, The City Gray that ne'er shall die.  Attractions  The World's Columbian Exposition was the first world's fair with an area for amusements that was strictly separated from the exhibition halls. This area, developed by a young music promoter, Sol Bloom, concentrated on Midway Plaisance and introduced the term midway to American English to describe the area of a carnival or fair where sideshows are located.It included carnival rides, among them the original Ferris Wheel, built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. This wheel was 264 feet high and had 36 cars, each of which could accommodate 40 people. The importance of the Columbian Exposition is highlighted by the use of rueda de Chicago in many Latin American countries such as Costa Rica and Chile in reference to the Ferris wheel. One attendee, George C. Tilyou, later credited the sights he saw on the Chicago midway for inspiring him to create America's first major amusement park, Steeplechase Park in Coney Island, New York. The fair included life size reproductions of Christopher Columbus' three ships, the Ni a , the Pinta, and the Santa Mar a. These were intended to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas. The ships, a joint project of the governments of Spain and the United States, were constructed in Spain and then sailed to America for the exposition. The ships were a very popular exhibit.Eadweard Muybridge gave a series of lectures on the Science of Animal Locomotion in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose on Midway Plaisance. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his moving pictures to a paying public. The hall was the first commercial movie theater.The Street in Cairo included the popular dancer known as Little Egypt. She introduced America to the suggestive version of the belly dance known as the hootchy kootchy, to a tune said to have been improvised by Sol Bloom which he had composed when his dancers had no music to dance to. Bloom did not copyright the song, putting it immediately in the public domain. Also included was the first moving walkway or travelator, which was designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee. It had two different divisions: one where passengers were seated, and one where riders could stand or walk. It ran in a loop down the length of a lakefront pier to a casino. Although denied a spot at the fair, Buffalo Bill Cody decided to come to Chicago anyway, setting up his Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show just outside the edge of the exposition. Nearby, historian Frederick Jackson Turner gave academic lectures reflecting on the end of the frontier which Buffalo Bill represented. The electrotachyscope of Ottomar Ansch tz was demonstrated, which used a Geissler tube to project the illusion of moving images. Louis Comfort Tiffany made his reputation with a stunning chapel designed and built for the Exposition. After the Exposition the Tiffany Chapel was sold several times, even going back to Tiffany's estate. It was eventually reconstructed and restored and in 1999 it was installed at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art. Architect Kirtland Cutter's Idaho Building, a rustic log construction, was a popular favorite, visited by an estimated 18 million people. The building's design and interior furnishings were a major precursor of the Arts and Crafts movement. Among the other attractions at the fair, several products that are well known today were introduced. These products included Juicy Fruit Gum, Cream of Wheat, Cracker Jacks, Shredded Wheat Cereal, and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, among many others.  Anthropology  There was an Anthropology Building at the World's Fair. Nearby, The Cliff Dwellers featured a rock and timber structure that was painted to recreate Battle Rock Mountain in Colorado, a stylized recreation of an American Indian cliff dwelling with pottery, weapons, and other relics on display. There was also an Eskimo display. There were also birch bark wigwams of the Penobscot tribe. Nearby was a working model Indian school, organized by the Office of Indian Affairs, that housed delegations of Native American students and their teachers from schools around the country for weeks at a time.  Rail  The John Bull locomotive was displayed. It was only 62 years old, having been built in 1831. It was the first locomotive acquisition by the Smithsonian Institution. The locomotive ran under its own power from Washington, DC, to Chicago to participate, and returned to Washington under its own power again when the exposition closed. In 1981 it was the oldest surviving operable steam locomotive in the world when it ran under its own power again. A Baldwin 2 4 2 locomotive was showcased at the exposition, and subsequently the 2 4 2 type was known as the Columbia. An original frog switch and portion of the superstructure of the famous 1826 Granite Railway in Massachusetts could be viewed. This was the first commercial railroad in the United States to evolve into a common carrier without an intervening closure. The railway brought granite stones from a rock quarry in Quincy, Massachusetts, so that the Bunker Hill Monument could be erected in Boston. The frog switch is now on public view in East Milton Square, Massachusetts, on the original right of way of the Granite Railway. Transportation by rail was the major mode of transportation. A 26 track train station was built at the South West corner of the fair. While trains from around the country would unload there, there was a local train to shuttle tourists from the Chicago Grand Central Station to the fair.  Country and state exhibition buildings  Forty six countries had pavilions at the exposition. Norway participated by sending the Viking, a replica of the Gokstad ship. It was built in Norway and sailed across the Atlantic by 12 men, led by Captain Magnus Andersen. In 1919 this ship was moved to Lincoln Park. It was relocated in 1996 to Good Templar Park in Geneva, Illinois, where it awaits renovation.Thirty four U.S. states also had their own pavilions. The work of noted feminist author Kate McPhelim Cleary was featured during the opening of the Nebraska Day ceremonies at the fair, which included a reading of her poem Nebraska . Among the state buildings present at the fair were California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas; each was meant to be architecturally representative of the corresponding states.Four United States territories also had pavilions located in one building: Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah.Visitors to the Louisiana Pavilion were each given a seedling of a cypress tree. This resulted in the spread of cypress trees to areas where they were not native. Cypress trees from those seedlings can be found in many areas of West Virginia, where they flourish in the climate.The Illinois was a detailed, full scale mockup of an Indiana class battleship, constructed as a naval exhibit.  Guns and artillery  The German firm Krupp had a pavilion of artillery, which apparently had cost one million dollars to stage, including a coastal gun of 42 cm in bore and a length of 33 calibres . A breech loaded gun, it weighed 120.46 long tons . According to the company's marketing: It carried a charge projectile weighing from 2,200 to 2,500 pounds which, when driven by 900 pounds of brown powder, was claimed to be able to penetrate at 2,200 yards a wrought iron plate three feet thick if placed at right angles. Nicknamed The Thunderer , the gun had an advertised range of 15 miles; on this occasion John Schofield declared Krupps' guns the greatest peacemakers in the world . This gun was later seen as a precursor of the company's World War I Dicke Berta howitzers.  Religions  The 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions, which ran from September 11 to September 27, marked the first formal gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western spiritual traditions from around the world. According to Eric J. Sharpe, Tomoko Masuzawa, and others, the event was considered radical at the time, since it allowed non Christian faiths to speak on their own behalf. For example, it is recognized as the first public mention of the Bah Faith in North America.; it was not taken seriously by European scholars until the 1960s.  Moving walkway  Along the banks of the lake, patrons on the way to the casino were taken on a moving walkway designed by architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee, the first of its kind open to the public, called The Great Wharf, Moving Sidewalk, it allowed people to walk along or ride in seats.  Horticulture  Horticultural exhibits at the Horticultural Hall included cacti and orchids as well as other plants in a greenhouse.  Architecture   White City  Most of the buildings of the fair were designed in the neoclassical architecture style. The area at the Court of Honor was known as The White City. Fa ades were made not of stone, but of a mixture of plaster, cement, and jute fiber called staff, which was painted white, giving the buildings their gleam. Architecture critics derided the structures as decorated sheds. The buildings were clad in white stucco, which, in comparison to the tenements of Chicago, seemed illuminated. It was also called the White City because of the extensive use of street lights, which made the boulevards and buildings usable at night. In 1892, working under extremely tight deadlines to complete construction, director of works Daniel Burnham appointed Francis Davis Millet to replace the fair's official director of color design, William Pretyman. Pretyman had resigned following a dispute with Burnham. After experimenting, Millet settled on a mix of oil and white lead whitewash that could be applied using compressed air spray painting to the buildings, taking considerably less time than traditional brush painting. Joseph Binks, maintenance supervisor at Chicago's Marshall Field's Wholesale Store, who had been using this method to apply whitewash to the subbasement walls of the store, got the job to paint the Exposition buildings. Claims this was the first use of spray painting may be apocryphal since journals from that time note this form of painting had already been in use in the railroad industry from the early 1880s.Many of the buildings included sculptural details and, to meet the Exposition's opening deadline, chief architect Burnham sought the help of Chicago Art Institute instructor Lorado Taft to help complete them. Taft's efforts included employing a group of talented women sculptors from the Institute known as the White Rabbits to finish some of the buildings, getting their name from Burnham's comment Hire anyone, even white rabbits if they'll do the work. The words Thine alabaster cities gleam from the song America the Beautiful were inspired by the White City.  White City controversy  According to University of Notre Dame history professor Gail Bederman, White City sparked considerable controversy. In her 1995 text Manliness and Civilization, she writes, The White City, with its vision of future perfection and of the advanced racial power of manly commerce and technology, constructed civilization as an ideal of white male power. According to Bederman, people of color were barred entirely from participating in the organization of the White City and were instead given access only to the Midway exhibit, which specialized in spectacles of barbarous races 'authentic' villages of Samoans, Egyptians, Dahomans, Turks, and other exotic peoples, populated by actual imported 'natives.' Two small exhibits were included in the White City's Woman's Building which addressed women of color. One, entitled Afro American was installed in a distant corner of the building. The other, called Woman's Work in Savagery, included baskets, weavings, and African, Polynesian, and Native American arts. Though they were produced by living women of color, the materials were represented as relics from the distant past, embodying the work of white women's own distant evolutionary foremothers. In response to these failings, civil rights leaders Ida B. Wells, Frederick Douglass, Irvine Garland Penn, and Ferdinand Lee Barnet wrote and circulated a pamphlet at the exposition titled The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition, which argued the exposition organizers had deliberately excluded African Americans from the White City in order to shame the Negro. By only allowing Black people to be featured in Midway, Wells and Douglass argued, the Dahomians are also here to exhibit the Negro as a repulsive savage. Ten thousand copies of the pamphlet were circulated in the White City from the Haitian Embassy , and the activists received responses from the delegations of England, Germany, France, Russia, and India.  Role in the City Beautiful Movement  The White City is largely credited for ushering in the City Beautiful movement and planting the seeds of modern city planning. The highly integrated design of the landscapes, promenades, and structures provided a vision of what is possible when planners, landscape architects, and architects work together on a comprehensive design scheme. The White City inspired cities to focus on the beautification of the components of the city in which municipal government had control; streets, municipal art, public buildings, and public spaces. The designs of the City Beautiful Movement are identifiable by their classical architecture, plan symmetry, picturesque views, and axial plans, as well as their magnificent scale. Where the municipal art movement focused on beautifying one feature in a city, the City Beautiful movement began to make improvements on the scale of the district. The White City of the World's Columbian Exposition inspired the Merchants Club of Chicago to commission Daniel Burnham to create the Plan of Chicago in 1909.  Great buildings  There were fourteen main great buildings : 17 centered around a giant reflective pool called the Grand Basin. Buildings included: The Administration Building, designed by Richard Morris Hunt The Agricultural Building, designed by Charles McKim of McKim, Mead White The Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building, designed by George B. Post. If this building were standing today, it would rank second in volume and third in footprint on list of largest buildings . It exhibited works related to literature, science, art and music. The Mines and Mining Building, designed by Solon Spencer Beman The Electricity Building, designed by Henry Van Brunt and Frank Maynard Howe The Machinery Hall, designed by Robert Swain Peabody of Peabody and Stearns The Woman's Building, designed by Sophia Hayden The Transportation Building, designed by Adler Sullivan The Fisheries Building designed by Henry Ives Cobb: 23 Forestry Building designed by Charles B. Atwood Horticultural Building designed by Jenney and Mundie Anthropology Building designed by Charles B. Atwood  Transportation Building  Louis Sullivan's polychrome proto Modern Transportation Building was an outstanding exception to the prevailing style, as he tried to develop an organic American form. Years later, in 1922, he wrote that the classical style of the White City had set back modern American architecture by forty years.As detailed in Erik Larson's popular history The Devil in the White City, extraordinary effort was required to accomplish the exposition, and much of it was unfinished on opening day. The famous Ferris Wheel, which proved to be a major attendance draw and helped save the fair from bankruptcy, was not finished until June, because of waffling by the board of directors the previous year on whether to build it. Frequent debates and disagreements among the developers of the fair added many delays. The spurning of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show proved a serious financial mistake. Buffalo Bill set up his highly popular show next door to the fair and brought in a great deal of revenue that he did not have to share with the developers. Nonetheless, construction and operation of the fair proved to be a windfall for Chicago workers during the serious economic recession that was sweeping the country.  Surviving structures   Almost all of the fair's structures were designed to be temporary; of the more than 200 buildings erected for the fair, the only two which still stand in place are the Palace of Fine Arts and the World's Congress Auxiliary Building. From the time the fair closed until 1920, the Palace of Fine Arts housed the Field Columbian Museum ; in 1933 , the Palace building re opened as the Museum of Science and Industry. The second building, the World's Congress Building, was one of the few buildings not built in Jackson Park, instead it was built downtown in Grant Park. The cost of construction of the World's Congress Building was shared with the Art Institute of Chicago, which, as planned, moved into the building after the close of the fair. The three other significant buildings that survived the fair represented Norway, the Netherlands, and the State of Maine. The Norway Building was a recreation of a traditional wooden stave church. After the Fair it was relocated to Lake Geneva, and in 1935 was moved to a museum called Little Norway in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. In 2015 it was dismantled and shipped back to Norway, where it was restored and reassembled. The second is the Maine State Building, designed by Charles Sumner Frost, which was purchased by the Ricker family of Poland Spring, Maine. They moved the building to their resort to serve as a library and art gallery. The Poland Spring Preservation Society now owns the building, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The third is The Dutch House, which was moved to Brookline, Massachusetts. The 1893 Viking ship that was sailed to the Exposition from Norway by Captain Magnus Andersen, is located in Geneva, Illinois. The ship is open to visitors on scheduled days April through October.The main altar at St. John Cantius in Chicago, as well as its matching two side altars, are reputed to be from the Columbian Exposition. Since many of the other buildings at the fair were intended to be temporary, they were removed after the fair. The White City so impressed visitors that plans were considered to refinish the exteriors in marble or some other material. These plans were abandoned in July 1894, when much of the fair grounds was destroyed in a fire.  Gallery        Criticism  Frank Lloyd Wright later wrote that By this overwhelming rise of grandomania I was confirmed in my fear that a native architecture would be set back at least fifty years.  Visitors Helen Keller, along with her mentor Anne Sullivan and Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, visited the fair in summer of 1893. Keller described the fair in her autobiography The Story of My Life. Early in July, a Wellesley College English teacher named Katharine Lee Bates visited the fair. The White City later inspired the reference to alabaster cities in her poem and lyrics America the Beautiful . The exposition was extensively reported by Chicago publisher William D. Boyce's reporters and artists. There is a very detailed and vivid description of all facets of this fair by the Persian traveler Mirza Mohammad Ali Mo'in ol Saltaneh written in Persian. He departed from Persia on April 20, 1892, especially for the purpose of visiting the World's Columbian Exposition. Pierre de Coubertin visited the fair with his friends Paul Bourget and Samuel Jean de Pozzi. He devotes the first chapter of his book Souvenirs d'Am rique et de Gr ce  to the visit. Swami Vivekananda visited the fair to attend the Parliament of the World's Religions and delivered his famous speech Sisters and Brothers of America! . Kubota Beisen was an official delegate of Japan. As an artist, he sketched hundreds of scenes, some of which were later used to make woodblock print books about the Exhibition. Serial killer H. H. Holmes attended the fair with two of his eventual victims, Annie and Minnie Williams.  Souvenirs  Examples of exposition souvenirs can be found in various American museum collections. One example, copyrighted in 1892 by John W. Green, is a folding hand fan with detailed illustrations of landscapes and architecture. Charles W Goldsmith produced a set of ten postcard designs, each in full colour, showing the buildings constructed for the exhibition. Columbian Exposition coins were also minted for the event.  Electricity  The effort to power the Fair with electricity, which became a demonstration piece for Westinghouse Electric and the alternating current system they had been developing for many years, took place at the end of what has been called the War of the currents between DC and AC. Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid to power the Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US 510,000 to supply an alternating current based system. Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US 1.72 million bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re bid their costs at 554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract. Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass stopper in one end, based on a Sawyer Man stopper lamp patent they already had. The lamps worked well but were short lived, requiring a small army of workmen to constantly replace them.: 140 Westinghouse Electric had severely underbid the contract and struggled to supply all the equipment specified including twelve 1,000 horsepower single phase AC generators and all the lighting and other equipment required. They also had to fend off a last minute lawsuit by General Electric claiming the Westinghouse Sawyer Man based stopper lamp infringed on the Edison incandescent lamp patent.: 142 The International Exposition was held in an Electricity Building which was devoted to electrical exhibits. A statue of Benjamin Franklin was displayed at the entrance. The exposition featured interior and exterior light and displays as well as displays of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope, search lights, a seismograph, electric incubators for chicken eggs, and Morse code telegraph.: 22 All the exhibits were from commercial enterprises. Participants included General Electric, Brush, Western Electric, and Westinghouse. The Westinghouse Company displayed several polyphase systems. The exhibits included a switchboard, polyphase generators, step up transformers, transmission line, step down transformers, commercial size induction motors and synchronous motors, and rotary direct current converters . The working scaled system allowed the public a view of a system of polyphase power which could be transmitted over long distances, and be utilized, including the supply of direct current. Meters and other auxiliary devices were also present. Part of the space occupied by the Westinghouse Company was devoted to demonstrations of electrical devices developed by Nikola Tesla including induction motors and the generators used to power the system. The rotating magnetic field that drove these motors was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two phase coil in the induction motors to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.Tesla himself showed up for a week in August to attend the International Electrical Congress, being held at the fair's Agriculture Hall, and put on a series of demonstrations of his wireless lighting system in a specially set up darkened room at the Westinghouse exhibit. These included demonstrations he had previously performed throughout America and Europe including using a nearby coil to light a wireless gas discharge lamp held in his hand.Also at the Fair, the Chicago Athletic Association Football team played one of the first night football games against West Point . Chicago won the game 14 0. The game lasted only 40 minutes, compared to the normal 90 minutes.  Music   Musicians  John Philip Sousa s Band played for the Exposition dedication celebration in Chicago, 10 October through 21 October 1892. Joseph Douglass, classical violinist, who achieved wide recognition after his performance there and became the first African American violinist to conduct a transcontinental tour and the first to tour as a concert violinist. Sissieretta Jones, a soprano known as the Black Patti and an already famous opera singer. A paper on African American spirituals and shouts by Abigail Christensen was read to attendees.There were many other black artists at the fair, ranging from minstrel and early ragtime groups to more formal classical ensembles to street buskers. Scott Joplin, pianist, from Texarkana, Texas; became widely known for his piano playing at the fair.  Other music and musicians  The first Indonesian music performance in the United States was at the exposition. The gamelan instruments used in the performance were later placed in the Field Museum of Natural History. A group of hula dancers led to increased awareness of Hawaiian music among Americans throughout the country. Stoughton Musical Society, the oldest choral society in the United States, presented the first concerts of early American music at the exposition. The first eisteddfod held outside Wales was held in Chicago at the exposition. A 250 voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir competed in the Eisteddfod taking the second place prize of 1000. This was the first appearance of the Choir outside the Utah territory. August 12, 1893 Anton n Dvo k conducted a gala Bohemian Day concert at the exposition, besieged by visitors including the conductor of the Chicago Symphony, who arranged for performance of Dvo k's American string quartet, just completed in Spillville, Iowa, during a Dvo k family vacation in a Czech speaking community there. American composer Amy Beach was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the fair to compose a choral work for the opening of the Woman's Building. Sousa's Band played concerts in the south bandstand on the Great Plaza, 25 May to 28 June 1893. The University of Illinois Military Band conducted by student leaders Charles Elder and Richard Sharpe played concerts twice daily in the Illinois Building 9 June to 24 June 1893. Soloists were William Sandford, euphonium; Charles Elder, clarinet; William Steele, cornet. The band members slept on cots on the top floor of the building. 8 June 1893 The Exposition Orchestra, an expanded version of the Chicago Symphony conducted by guest conductor Vojt ch I. Hlav , played the American premiere of Modest Mussorgsky's A Night on Bald Mountain as part of a concert of Russian folk music. A pipe organ containing over 3,900 pipes, one of the largest in the world at the time, was built by the Farrand Votey Organ Company to the specifications of Chicago organist Clarence Eddy. It was one of the first great organs to rely on electrical connections from its keys to its pipes. Musicologist Anna Morsch and composer Charlotte Sporleder presented a program of German music. Composer and pianist Anita Socola Specht won the title best amateur pianist in the United States, although some of the judges told her, You are not an amateur, you are an artist!  Art   American artists exhibiting   Painters   Japanese art  Japan's artistic contribution was mainly in porcelain, cloisonn enamel, metalwork and embroidery. While 55 paintings and 24 sculptures came from Japan, 271 of the 290 exhibits in the Palace of Fine Arts were Japanese. Artists represented included Miyagawa Kozan, Yabu Meizan, Namikawa S suke, and Suzuki Chokichi.  Women artists exhibiting  The women artists at the Woman's Building included Anna Lownes, Viennese painter Rosa Schweninger, and many others. American composer Amy Cheney Beach was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers of the fair to compose a choral work for the opening of the Woman's Building. Women inventions, such as the Mrs Potts sad iron system was on display. Ami Mali Hicks' stencil design was selected to adorn the frieze in the assembly room of the Women's Building. Musicologist Anna Morsch and composer Charlotte Sporleder presented a program of German music.The Woman's Building included a Woman's Building Library Exhibit, which had 7,000 books all by women. The Woman's Building Library was meant to show the cumulative contribution of the world's women to literature.  Greatest Refrigerator on Earth fire tragedy In the large 255' X 130' Romanesque structure standing almost 200' tall at its highest point, housing both the cold storage for keeping perishables for the food services at the event, and an ice skating rink for patrons at the level above the cold storage, and referred to as the Greatest Refrigerator on Earth ; underdeveloped safety standards where high temperature heat sources from machinery is believed to have ignited wooden structure in the building interior, causing the massive fire that caused the deaths of 12 firemen and 4 workers.  Notable firsts   Concepts  Frederick Jackson Turner lectured on his Frontier thesis. The Pledge of Allegiance was first performed at the exposition by a mass of school children lined up in military fashion. Contribution to Chicago's nickname, the Windy City . Some argue that Charles Anderson Dana of the New York Sun coined the term related to the hype of the city's promoters. Other evidence, however, suggests the term was used as early as 1881 in relation to either Chicago's windbag politicians or to its weather.  Commemorations  United States Mint offered its first commemorative coins: the Columbian Exposition quarter dollar and Columbian Exposition half dollar The United States Post Office Department produced its first picture postcards and Commemorative stamp set  Edibles and potables  Cream of Wheat The brownie was invented by Bertha Palmer for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Milton Hershey bought a European exhibitor's chocolate manufacturing equipment and added chocolate products to his caramel manufacturing business. Juicy Fruit gum Quaker Oats Shredded Wheat Pabst Blue Ribbon Peanut butter Aunt Jemima pancake mix was widely popularized by spokesperson Nancy Green's pancake cooking and story telling performances. Cracker Jack's new recipe was introduced at the Exposition Vienna Sausage started selling its frankfurters and sausages near one of the entrances to the Midway Plaisance, just outside the Old Vienna Village. The company later became known as Vienna Beef, famously recognized as Chicago's Hot Dog .  Inventions and manufacturing advances  A device that made plates for printing books in Braille, unveiled by Frank Haven Hall, who met Helen Keller and her teacher Anne Sullivan at the exhibit. Moving walkway, or travelator The third rail giving electric power to elevated trains led directly to its first continuing US use. The clasp locker, a clumsy slide fastener and forerunner to the zipper was demonstrated by Whitcomb L. Judson Elongated coins Ferris Wheel First fully electrical kitchen including an automatic dishwasher Phosphorescent lamps John T. Shayne Company, the local Chicago furrier helped America gain respect on the world stage of manufacturing Clark cell as a standard for measuring voltage A first prototype of a pressurized aerosol spray, by Francis Davis Millet. The first practical electric automobile, invented by William Morrison.  Organizations  Congress of Mathematicians, precursor to International Congress of Mathematicians Interfaith dialogue First recorded public mention of the Bah Faith in North America  Performances  The poet and humorist Benjamin Franklin King, Jr. first performed at the exposition. Bodybuilder Eugen Sandow demonstrated feats of strength, promoted by Florenz Ziegfeld. Magician Harry Houdini and his brother Theodore performed their magic act at the Midway.  Later years  The exposition was one influence leading to the rise of the City Beautiful movement. Results included grand buildings and fountains built around Olmstedian parks, shallow pools of water on axis to central buildings, larger park systems, broad boulevards and parkways and, after the start of the 20th century, zoning laws and planned suburbs. Examples of the City Beautiful movement's works include the City of Chicago, the Columbia University campus, and the National Mall in Washington D.C. After the fair closed, J.C. Rogers, a banker from Wamego, Kansas, purchased several pieces of art that had hung in the rotunda of the U.S. Government Building. He also purchased architectural elements, artifacts and buildings from the fair. He shipped his purchases to Wamego. Many of the items, including the artwork, were used to decorate his theater, now known as the Columbian Theatre. Memorabilia saved by visitors can still be purchased. Numerous books, tokens, published photographs, and well printed admission tickets can be found. While the higher value commemorative stamps are expensive, the lower ones are quite common. So too are the commemorative half dollars, many of which went into circulation. Although not available for purchase, The George Washington University maintains a small collection of exposition tickets for viewing and research purposes. The collection is currently cared for by GWU's Special Collections Research Center, located in the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library.When the exposition ended the Ferris Wheel was moved to Chicago's north side, next to an exclusive neighborhood. An unsuccessful Circuit Court action was filed against the owners of the wheel to have it moved. The wheel stayed there until it was moved to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair.The Columbian Exposition has celebrated many anniversaries since the fair in 1893. The Chicago Historical Society held an exhibition to commemorate the fair. The Grand Illusions exhibition was centered around the idea that the Columbian Exposition was made up of a series of illusions. The commemorative exhibition contained partial reconstructions, a video detailing the fair, and a catalogue similar to the one sold at the World's Fair of 1893.  In popular culture The Exposition is portrayed in the 2017 historical film, The Current War, concerning the competition between George Westinghouse and Thomas Edison to establish the dominant form of electricity in the United States. 1893: A World's Fair Mystery, an interactive fiction by Peter Nepstad that recreates the Exposition in detail.

            "text": "A rotating magnetic field is the resultant magnetic field produced by a system of coils symmetrically placed and supplied with polyphase currents. A rotating magnetic field can be produced by a poly phase current or by a single phase current provided that, in the latter case, two field windings are supplied and are so designed that the two resulting magnetic fields generated thereby are out of phase.Rotating magnetic fields are often utilized for electromechanical applications, such as induction motors, electric generators and induction regulators.  History In 1824, the French physicist Fran ois Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields using a rotating copper disk and a needle, termed Arago's rotations. English experimenters Charles Babbage and John Herschel found they could induce rotation in Arago's copper disk by spinning a horseshoe magnet under it, with English scientist Michael Faraday later attributing the effect to electromagnetic induction. In 1879, English physicist Walter Baily replaced the horseshoe magnets with four electromagnets and, by manually turning switches on and off, demonstrated a primitive induction motor.Practical application of a rotating magnetic field in an AC motor is generally attributed to two inventors, the Italian physicist and electrical engineer Galileo Ferraris, and the Serbian American inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Tesla claimed in his autobiography that the idea came to him in 1882 when he was walking in a park, drawing it in the sand to illustrate how it worked to a friend. Ferraris wrote about researching the concept and built a working model in 1885. In 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin and Tesla obtained a United States patent for his design.  Description The rotating magnetic field is the key principle in the operation of induction machines. The induction motor consists of a stator and rotor. In the stator a group of fixed windings are so arranged that a two phase current, for example, produces a magnetic field which rotates at an angular velocity determined by the frequency of the alternating current. The rotor or armature consists of coils wound in slots, which are short circuited and in which the changing flux generated by the field poles induce a current. The flux generated by the armature current reacts upon the field poles and the armature is set in rotation in a definite direction. A symmetric rotating magnetic field can be produced with as few as two polar wound coils driven at 90 degree phasing. However, three sets of coils are nearly always used, because it is compatible with a symmetric three phase AC sine current system. The three coils are driven with each set 120 degrees in phase from the others. For the purpose of this example, the magnetic field is taken to be the linear function of the coil's current. The result of adding three 120 degree phased sine waves on the axis of the motor is a single rotating vector that always remains constant in magnitude. The rotor has a constant magnetic field. The north pole of the rotor will move toward the south pole of the magnetic field of the stator, and vice versa. This magnetomechanical attraction creates a force that will drive the rotor to follow the rotating magnetic field in a synchronous manner. A permanent magnet in such a field will rotate so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was utilized in early alternating current electric motors. A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with a 90 degree phase difference in their alternating currents. However, in practice, such a system would be supplied through a three wire arrangement with unequal currents. This inequality would cause serious problems in the standardization of the conductor size. In order to overcome this, three phase systems are used in which the three currents are equal in magnitude and have a 120 degree phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees will create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three phase system to create the rotating field utilized in electric motors is one of the main reasons why three phase systems dominate the world s electric power supply systems. Rotating magnetic fields are also used in induction motors. Because magnets degrade with time, induction motors use short circuited rotors , which follow the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. In these motors, the short circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, which in turn move the rotor by Lorentz force. These types of motors are not usually synchronous, but instead necessarily involve a degree of 'slip' in order that the current may be produced due to the relative movement of the field and the rotor.

            "text": "Nikola Tesla patented the Tesla coil circuit on April 25, 1891. and first publicly demonstrated it May 20, 1891 in his lecture Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers at Columbia College, New York. Although Tesla patented many similar circuits during this period, this was the first that contained all the elements of the Tesla coil: high voltage primary transformer, capacitor, spark gap, and air core oscillation transformer .  Invention  . During the Industrial Revolution the electrical industry exploited direct current and low frequency alternating current , but not much was known about frequencies above 20 kHz, what are now called radio frequencies. In 1887, four years previously, Heinrich Hertz had discovered Hertzian waves , electromagnetic waves which oscillated at very high frequencies. This attracted much attention, and a number of researchers began experimenting with high frequency currents. Tesla's background was in the new field of alternating current power systems, so he understood transformers and resonance. In 1888 he decided that high frequencies were the most promising field for research, and set up a laboratory at 33 South Fifth Avenue, New York for researching them, initially repeating Hertz's experiments. He first developed alternators as sources of high frequency current, but by 1890 found they were limited to frequencies of about 20 kHz. In search of higher frequencies he turned to spark excited resonant circuits. Tesla's innovation was in applying resonance to transformers. Transformers functioned differently at high frequencies than at the low frequencies used in power systems; the iron core in low frequency transformers caused energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis. Tesla and Elihu Thomson independently developed a new type of transformer without an iron core, the oscillation transformer , and the Tesla coil circuit to drive it to produce high voltages. Tesla invented the Tesla coil during efforts to develop a wireless lighting system, with gas discharge light bulbs that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source. For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil with his high frequency alternator. He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. To fix this problem Tesla changed the design so that there was an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies. He found that the highest voltages were generated when the closed primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the open secondary winding.  Tesla was not the first to invent this circuit. Henry Rowland built a spark excited resonant transformer circuit in 1889 and Elihu Thomson had experimented with similar circuits in 1890, including one which could produce 64 inch sparks, and other sources confirm Tesla was not the first. However he was the first to see practical applications for it and patent it. Tesla did not perform detailed mathematical analyses of the circuit, relying instead on trial and error and his intuitive understanding of resonance. He even realized that the secondary coil functioned as a quarter wave resonator; he specified the length of the wire in the secondary coil must be a quarter wavelength at the resonant frequency. The first mathematical analyses of the circuit were done by Anton Oberbeck and Paul Drude .  Tesla's demonstrations  A charismatic showman and self promoter, in 1891 1893 Tesla used the Tesla coil in dramatic public lectures demonstrating the new science of high voltage, high frequency electricity. The radio frequency AC electric currents produced by a Tesla coil did not behave like the DC or low frequency AC current scientists of the time were familiar with. In lectures at Columbia College May 20, 1891, scientific societies in Britain and France during an 1892 European speaking tour, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia in February 1893, and the National Electric Light Association, St. Louis in March 1893, he impressed audiences with spectacular brush discharges and streamers, heated iron by induction heating, showed RF current could pass through insulators and be conducted by a single wire without a return path, and powered light bulbs and motors without wires. He demonstrated that high frequency currents often did not cause the sensation of electric shock, applying hundreds of thousands of volts to his own body, causing his body to light up with a glowing corona discharge in the darkened room. These lectures introduced the Tesla oscillator to the scientific community, and made Tesla internationally famous.  Wireless power experiments  Tesla employed the Tesla coil in his efforts to achieve wireless power transmission, his lifelong dream. In the period 1891 to 1900 he used it to perform some of the first experiments in wireless power, transmitting radio frequency power across short distances by inductive coupling between coils of wire. In his early 1890s demonstrations such as those before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago he lit light bulbs from across a room. He found he could increase the distance by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the Tesla coil's LC circuit, transferring energy by resonant inductive coupling. At his Colorado Springs laboratory during 1899 1900, by using voltages of the order of 10 million volts generated by his enormous magnifying transmitter coil , he was able to light three incandescent lamps at a distance of about 100 feet . Today the resonant inductive coupling discovered by Tesla is a familiar concept in electronics, widely used in IF transformers and short range wireless power transmission systems such as cellphone charging pads. It is now understood that inductive and capacitive coupling are near field effects, so they cannot be used for long distance transmission. However, Tesla was convinced he could develop a long range wireless power transmission system which could transmit power from power plants directly into homes and factories without wires, described in a visionary June 1900 article in Century Magazine; The Problem of Increasing Human Energy . He claimed to be able to transmit power on a worldwide scale, using a method that involved conduction through the Earth and atmosphere. Tesla believed that the entire Earth could act as an electrical resonator, and that by driving current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil with an elevated capacitance, the potential of the Earth could be made to oscillate, creating global standing waves, and this alternating current could be received with a capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth. Another of his ideas was that transmitting and receiving terminals could be suspended in the air by balloons at 30,000 feet altitude, where the air pressure is lower. At this altitude, he thought, a layer of electrically conductive rarefied air would allow electricity to be sent at high voltages over long distances. Tesla envisioned building a global network of wireless power stations, which he called his World Wireless System , which would transmit both information and electric power to everyone on Earth. There is no reliable evidence that he ever transmitted significant amounts of power beyond the short range demonstrations above.  Magnifying transmitter  Tesla's wireless research required increasingly high voltages, and he had reached the limit of the voltages he could generate within the space of his New York lab. Between 1899 and 1900 he built a laboratory in Colorado Springs and performed experiments on wireless transmission there. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it. The Colorado Springs laboratory had one of the largest Tesla coils ever built, which Tesla called a magnifying transmitter as it was intended to transmit power to a distant receiver. With an input power of 300 kilowatts it could produce potentials of the order of 10 million volts, at frequencies of 50 150 kHz, creating huge lightning bolts reportedly up to 135 feet long. During experiments, it caused an overload which destroyed the alternator of the Colorado Springs power company, and Tesla had to rebuild the alternator.In the magnifying transmitter, Tesla used a modified design which he had developed in his New York lab in the period 1895 1898, and patented in 1902, different from his previous double tuned circuits. In addition to the primary and secondary coils, it had a third coil which he called the extra coil, not magnetically coupled to the others, attached to the top terminal of the secondary. When driven by the secondary it produced additional high voltage by resonance, being adjusted to resonate with its own parasitic capacitance The use of a series fed resonator coil to generate high voltages was independently discovered by Paul Marie Oudin in 1893 and employed in his Oudin coil.The Colorado Springs apparatus consisted of a 51 foot diameter Tesla transformer composed of a secondary winding of 50 turns of heavy wire wound on a 6 foot high circular wooden fence around the periphery of the lab, and a single turn primary either mounted on the fence or buried in the ground under it. The primary was connected to a bank of oil capacitors to make a tuned circuit, with a rotary spark gap , powered by 20 to 40 kilovolts from a powerful utility step up transformer . The top of the secondary was connected to the 100 turn 8 ft diameter extra or resonator coil in the center of the room. Its high voltage end was connected to a telescoping 143 foot antenna rod with a 30 inch metal ball on top which could project through the roof of the lab. By cranking the rod up or down he could adjust the capacitance in the circuit of the extra coil, tuning it to resonance with the rest of the circuit.  Wardenclyffe tower  In 1901, convinced his wireless theories were correct, Tesla with financing from banker J. P. Morgan began construction of a high voltage wireless station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. Although it was built as a transatlantic radiotelegraphy station, Tesla also intended it to transmit electric power without wires as a prototype transmitter for his proposed World Wireless System . Essentially an enormous Tesla coil, it consisted of a powerhouse with a 400 horsepower generator and a 187 foot tower topped by a 68 foot diameter metal dome capacitive electrode. The circuit he used was a version of the magnifying transmitter he built at Colorado Springs . Underneath the surface was an elaborate ground system that Tesla said was needed to grip the earth to create the oscillating earth currents which he believed would transmit the power. By 1904 his investors had pulled out and the facility was never completed; it was torn down in 1916. Although Tesla seems to have believed his wireless power ideas were proven, he had a history of making claims that he had not confirmed by experiment, and there seems to be no evidence that he ever transmitted significant power beyond the short range demonstrations mentioned above. The few reports of long distance power transmission by Tesla are not from reliable sources. For example, a widely repeated myth is that in 1899 he wirelessly lit 200 light bulbs at a distance of 26 miles . There is no independent confirmation of this supposed demonstration; Tesla did not mention it, and it does not appear in his laboratory notes. It originated in 1944 from Tesla's first biographer, John J. O'Neill, who said he pieced it together from fragmentary material... in a number of publications .In the 100 years since, others such as Robert Golka have built equipment similar to Tesla's, but long distance power transmission has not been demonstrated, and the scientific consensus is his World Wireless system would not have worked. Contemporary scientists point out that while Tesla's coils can function as radio transmitters, transmitting energy in the form of radio waves, the frequency he used, around 150 kHz, is far too low for practical long range power transmission. At these wavelengths the radio waves spread out in all directions and cannot be focused on a distant receiver. Tesla's world power transmission scheme remains today what it was in Tesla's time: a bold, fascinating dream.  Use in radio  The Tesla coil was invented not for wireless but for making vacuum lamps glow without external electrodes, and it later played a principal part in other hands in the operation of big spark stations. William H. Eccles, 1933One of the largest applications of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating in the same area their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.In 1892 William Crookes, a friend of Tesla, had given a lecture on the uses of radio waves in which he suggested using resonance to reduce the bandwidth in transmitters and receivers. By using resonant circuits, different transmitters could be tuned to transmit on different frequencies. With narrower bandwidth, separate transmitter frequencies would no longer overlap, so a receiver could receive a particular transmission by tuning its resonant circuit to the same frequency as the transmitter. This is the system used in all modern radio. With an appropriate wire antenna, the Tesla coil circuit could function as such a narrow bandwidth radio transmitter. In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system that was the first use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication. A grounded spark excited capacitor tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated wire antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube. This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the four circuit concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio communication system. He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth.Practical radiotelegraphy communication systems were developed by Marconi beginning in 1895. By 1897 the advantages of narrow bandwidth systems noted by Crookes were recognized, and resonant circuits, capacitors and inductors, were incorporated in transmitters and receivers. The closed primary, open secondary resonant transformer circuit used by Tesla proved a superior transmitter, because the loosely coupled transformer partially isolated the oscillating primary circuit from the energy radiating antenna circuit, reducing the damping, allowing it to produce long ringing waves which had a narrower bandwidth. Versions of the circuit were patented by Marconi, John Stone Stone and Oliver Lodge, and were widely used in radio for twenty years. In 1906 Max Wien invented the quenched or series spark gap, which extinguished the spark after the energy had been transferred to the secondary, allowing the secondary to oscillate freely after that, reducing damping and bandwidth still more. Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced damped waves which had a wide bandwidth, creating interference with other transmitters. Around 1920 they became obsolete, superseded by vacuum tube transmitters which generated continuous waves at a single frequency, which could also be modulated to carry sound. Tesla's resonant transformer continued to be used in vacuum tube transmitters and receivers, and is a key component in radio to this day.During the spark era the radio engineering profession gave credit to Tesla; his circuit became known as the Tesla coil or Tesla transformer . However Tesla did not benefit financially, due to competing patent claims. Marconi had claimed rights to the closed primary open secondary transmitter circuit in his controversial 1900 four circuit wireless patent. Tesla sued Marconi in 1915 for patent infringement, but didn't have the resources to pursue the action. However, in 1943, in a separate suit brought by the Marconi Company against the US government for use of its patents in World War I, the US Supreme Court invalidated Marconi's 1900 patent claim to the four circuit concept. The ruling cited the prior patents of Tesla, Lodge, and Stone, but did not decide which of these parties had rights to the circuit. By that time the issue was moot; the patent had expired in 1915 and spark transmitters had long been obsolete. Although there is some disagreement over the role Tesla himself played in the invention of radio, sources agree on the importance of his circuit in early radio transmitters. From a modern perspective, most spark transmitters could be regarded as Tesla coils.  Use in medicine  Tesla had observed as early as 1891 that high frequency currents above 10 kHz did not cause the sensation of electric shock, and in fact currents that would be lethal at lower frequencies could be passed through the body without apparent harm. He experimented on himself, and claimed daily applications of high voltage relieved depression. He was one of the first to observe the heating effect of high frequency currents on the body, the basis of diathermy. During his highly publicized early 1890s demonstrations he passed hundreds of thousands of volts through his body. With characteristic hyperbole he called electricity the greatest of all doctors and suggested burying wires under classrooms so its stimulating effect would improve performance of dull schoolchildren. Tesla wrote two pioneering papers, in 1891 and 1898 on the medical uses of high frequency currents, but did little further work on the subject. A few other researchers were also experimentally applying high frequency currents to the body at this time. Elihu Thomson, the co inventor of the Tesla coil, was one, so in medicine the Tesla coil became known as the Tesla Thomson apparatus . In France, from 1889 physician and pioneering biophysicist Jacques d'Arsonval had been documenting the physiological effects of high frequency current on the body, and had made the same discoveries as Tesla. During his 1892 European trip Tesla met with D'Arsonval and was flattered to find they were using similar circuits. D'Arsonval's spark excited resonant circuits did not produce as high voltage as the Tesla transformer. In 1893 French physician Paul Marie Oudin added a resonator coil to the D'Arsonval circuit to create the high voltage Oudin coil, a circuit very similar to the Tesla coil, which was widely used for treating patients in Europe.During this period, people were fascinated by the new technology of electricity, and many believed it had miraculous curative or vitalizing powers. Medical ethics were also looser, and doctors could experiment on their patients. By the turn of the century, application of high voltage, high frequency currents to the body had become part of a Victorian era medical field, part legitimate experimental medicine and part quack medicine, called electrotherapy. Manufacturers produced medical apparatus to generate Tesla currents , D'Arsonval currents , and Oudin currents for physicians. In electrotherapy, a pointed electrode attached to the high voltage terminal of the coil was held near the patient, and the luminous brush discharges from it were applied to parts of the body to treat a wide variety of medical conditions. In order to apply the electrode directly to the skin, or tissues inside the mouth, anus or vagina, a vacuum electrode was used, consisting of a metal electrode sealed inside a partially evacuated glass tube, which produced a dramatic violet glow. The glass wall of the tube and the skin surface formed a capacitor which limited the current to the patient, preventing discomfort. These vacuum electrodes were later manufactured with handheld Tesla coils to make violet ray wands, sold to the public as a quack home medical device.The popularity of electrotherapy peaked after World War I, but by the 1920s authorities began to crack down on fraudulent medical treatments, and electrotherapy largely became obsolete. A part of the field that survived was diathermy, the application of high frequency current to heat body tissue, pioneered by German physician Karl Nagelschmidt in 1907. During the 1920s long wave Tesla coil spark diathermy machines were used, in which the current was applied to the body by electrodes. By the 1930s these were being replaced by short wave vacuum tube diathermy machines, which had less danger of causing burns, but Tesla coils continued to be used in both diathermy and quack medical devices like violet ray until World War II. In 1926 William T. Bovie discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and spark oscillators were used as electrosurgery generators or Bovies as late as the 1980s.During the 1920s and 30s all unipolar high voltage medical coils came to be called Oudin coils, so today's unipolar Tesla coils are sometimes referred to as Oudin coils .  Use in show business  The Tesla coil's spectacular displays of sparks, and the fact that its currents could pass through the human body without causing electric shock, led to its use in the entertainment business. In the early 20th century it appeared in traveling carnivals, freak shows and circus and carnival sideshows, which often had an act in which a performer would pass high voltages through his body Performers such as Dr. Resisto , The Human Dynamo , Electrice , The Great Volta , and Madamoiselle Electra would have their body connected to the high voltage terminal of a hidden Tesla coil, causing sparks to shoot from their fingertips and other parts of their body, and neon lights and fluorescent tube lamps to light up when brought near them. They could also light candles or cigarettes with their fingers. Although they didn't usually cause electric shocks, RF arc discharges from the bare skin could cause painful burns; to prevent them performers sometimes wore metal thimbles on their fingertips . These acts were extremely dangerous and could kill the performer if the Tesla coil was misadjusted. In carny lingo this was called an electric chair act because it often included a spark laced electrocution of the performer in an electric chair, exploiting public fascination with this exotic new method of capital punishment, which had become the United States' dominant method of execution around 1900. Today entertainers still perform high voltage acts with Tesla coils, but modern bioelectromagnetics has brought a new awareness of the hazards of Tesla coil currents, and allowing them to pass through the body is today considered extremely dangerous. Tesla coils were also used as dramatic props in early mystery and science fiction motion pictures, starting in the silent era. The crackling, writhing sparks emanating from the electrode of a giant Tesla coil became Hollywood's iconic symbol of the mad scientist's lab, recognized throughout the world. This was probably because the eccentric Nikola Tesla himself, with his famous high voltage demonstrations and his mysterious Colorado Springs laboratory, was one of the main prototypes from which the mad scientist stock character originated. Some early films in which Tesla coils appeared were Wolves of Kultur , The Power God , Metropolis , Frankenstein and its many sequels such as Son of Frankenstein , The Mask of Fu Manchu , Chandu the Magician , The Lost City , and The Clutching Hand and many later films and television shows. By the 1980s, effects like high voltage sparks were being added to movies by CGI as visual effects in post production, eliminating the need for dangerous high voltage Tesla coils on sets. The Tesla coils for many of these movies were constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden who, beginning with his spectacular effects in the 1931 Frankenstein, became Hollywood's preeminent electrical special effects expert. His large Meg Senior Tesla coil seen in many of these movies consisted of a 6 foot 1000 turn conical secondary and a 10 turn primary, connected to a capacitor through a rotary spark gap, powered by a 20 kV transformer. It could produce 6 foot sparks. Some of his last gigs were the reassembly of the original 1931 Frankenstein high voltage apparatus for the Mel Brooks satire Young Frankenstein , and construction of a million volt Tesla coil which produced 12 foot sparks for a 1976 stage show by the rock band Kiss.  Use in education  Ever since Tesla's 1890s lectures, Tesla coils have been used as attractions in educational exhibits and science fairs. They have become a way to counter the stereotype that science is boring. In the early 20th century, experts like Henry Transtrom and Earle Ovington gave high voltage demonstrations at electric fairs . High school classes built Tesla coils. From 1933 into the 1980s, between movie jobs Hollywood special effects expert Ken Strickfaden would take his high voltage apparatus on the road in an exhibition called Science on Parade and later The Kenstric Space Age Science Show to high schools, colleges, World Fairs and expositions. These spectacular shows, which reached 48 states, had a seminal influence on the birth of the modern coiling movement. A number of present day Tesla hobbyists such as William Wysock say they were inspired to build Tesla coils by seeing Strickfaden's show.One of the oldest and best known coils still in operation is the GPO 1 at Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. It was originally one of a pair of coils built in 1910 by Earle L. Ovington, a friend of Tesla and manufacturer of high voltage electrotherapy apparatus. For a number of years Ovington displayed them at the December electrical trade show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, using them for demonstrations of high voltage science, which Tesla himself sometimes attended. Called the Million Volt Oscillator, the twin coils were installed on the balcony at the show. Every hour the lights were dimmed and the public was treated to a display of 10 foot arcs. Ovington gave the coils to his friend Dr. Frederick Finch Strong, whose work focused on electrotherapy as an alternative health treatment. In 1937 Strong donated the coils to the Griffith Observatory. The museum didn't have room to display both, but one coil was restored by Kenneth Strickfaden and has been in daily operation ever since. It consists of a 48 in. high conical secondary coil topped by a 12 in. diameter copper ball electrode, with a 9 turn spiral primary of 2 in. copper strip, a glass plate capacitor , and rotary spark gap. Its output has been estimated at 1.3 million volts.  Later uses  In addition to its use in spark gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the Tesla coil circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the Tesla coil was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing. In 1926, pioneering accelerator physicists Merle Tuve and Gregory Breit built a 5 million volt Tesla coil as a linear particle accelerator. The bipolar coil consisted of a pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of fine wire, with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used for a short period in 1929 30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage. In 1970 Robert K. Golka built a replica of Tesla's huge Colorado Springs magnifying transmitter in a shed at Wendover Air Force Base, Utah, using data he found in Tesla's lab notes archived at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Serbia. This was one of the first experiments with the magnifier circuit since Tesla's time. The coil generated 12 million volts. Golka used it to try to duplicate Tesla's reported synthesis of ball lightning.  References",

            "text": "David Hatcher Childress is a French born American author, and the owner of Adventures Unlimited Press, a publishing house established in 1984 specializing in books on unusual topics such as ancient mysteries, unexplained phenomena, alternative history, and historical revisionism. His own works primarily concentrate on pseudoarchaeological and pseudoscientific topics such as Atlantis and Lemuria, pole shifts, the hollow earth, pre Columbian trans oceanic contact, suppressed technology, Nikola Tesla, free energy, UFOs and ancient astronauts, anti gravity, vimana aircraft, secret societies and other conspiracy theories. More recently, he has written on time travel and cryptozoology phenomena such as the yeti and sasquatch. Childress refers to himself as a rogue archaeologist .  Biography Born in France to American parents, and raised in Colorado and Montana, United States, Childress went to University of Montana Missoula to study archaeology, but left college in 1976 at 19 to begin travelling in pursuit of his archaeological interests. After several years in Asia and then Africa, Childress moved in 1983 to Stelle, Illinois, a community founded by New Age writer Richard Kieninger; Childress had been given one of Kieninger's books while touring Africa. Childress chronicled his explorations in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s in his Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries series of books. Childress's first book, A Hitchhikers Guide to Africa and Arabia, was published in 1983 by Chicago Review Press. In 1984, Childress moved to Kempton, Illinois, and established a publishing company named Adventures Unlimited Press, which is a sole proprietorship. His company published his own works and then those of other authors, presenting fringe scientific theories regarding ancient civilizations, cryptozoology, and little known technologies. In 1992, Childress founded the World Explorers Club, which occasionally runs tours to places he writes about, and publishes a magazine called World Explorer.Childress has appeared on NBC , Fox Network , Discovery Channel, A E, and History , to comment on subjects such as the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and UFOs. Since first entering the industry in 1984, Childress has been involved in two lawsuits regarding publishing; one, concerning the Kennedy assassination, failed after expiry of a statute of limitations and the other, involving an unpublished master's thesis about UFOs written in 1950, was settled out of court. Childress writes humorously about these suits in his 2000 autobiography A Hitchhiker's Guide to Armageddon. Childress has been interviewed on several radio programs.  Reception Patrick D. Nunn, a professor of geography at the University of the Sunshine Coast has noted that Childress is a proponent of pseudoscientific claims such as the lost continent Mu and megaliths on the Pacific islands built by levitation. Nunn has written that the disappearance of Mu is very convenient because it means that theorists like Childress can say what they like and appear convincing to people who are comparatively uninformed, as many naturally are, of the huge body of scientific information on Pacific geology and cultures. Historical archaeologist Charles E. Orser has criticized Childress's writings: Pseudo archaeologists continue to perpetuate the idea that Atlantis was a racialized place. David Hatcher Childress, one of the most flagrant violators of basic archaeological reasoning, has provided perhaps the most outrageous racialized vision of Atlantis. In discussing Tiahuanaco in Bolivia as a palace built long before any Native South Americans were present Childress proposes that the majestic site could only have been constructed by the Atlantean League. The league was composed of mythic seafarers who sailed the world spreading a megalithic culture, and wore red turbans over their blond hair . Nowhere did Plato, the only actual source on Atlantis, mention the blond hair of the Atlanteans. Plato did mention that the men and women of Atlantis, being semi divine, were inherently good . . . The correlation between goodness and whiteness is thus obvious in Childress's formulation and in much else that has been written about Atlantis.  Publications Childress's company has published nearly 200 books over the course of two dozen years. Childress himself has authored and co authored over a dozen books, from his first in 1983 to his most recent in 2013. His influences include Erich von D niken, Thor Heyerdahl, and Charles Berlitz.

            "text": "Robert Underwood Johnson was an American writer, poet, and diplomat.  Biography Robert Underwood Johnson was born in Centerville, Indiana, on January 12, 1853. His brother Henry Underwood Johnson became a member of Congress from that district . His father, Nimrod Hoge Johnson was a lawyer and judge. His mother, Catherine Coyle Underwood was a suffragette. He was schooled in Calvinist Presbyterianism by his uncle by marriage, the Reverend Charles H. Raymond, who served as charg d affaires of the Republic of Texas at Washington before its admission as a state of the Union and by Quakerism of the Johnsons. He attended the Quaker Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, beginning at age fourteen and graduated with a B.S. in 1871. Johnson s first work was as a clerk in Chicago, Illinois, agency of the educational books of Charles Scribner s Sons, and in 1873 he entered the firm s New York office, beginning his long connection with The Century Magazine, then Scribner s Monthly, under Josiah Gilbert Holland. The Century Magazine was directed at leaders in the political, religious, artistic, and social opinion circles. One of his first major projects for Scribner's was the editing of Century War Series and the subsequent four volumes Battles and Leaders of the Civil War , with the goal of raising circulation , was a series on the great battles of the Civil War from the point of view of officers on both sides based on accounts sourced from soldiers family records. Johnson succeeded in securing four papers from General Ulysses S. Grant which later formed the basis of Grant s Memoirs. He married Katharine McMahon on August 31, 1876, in Washington, DC. They had a son, Owen McMahon Johnson , who became an American writer in his own right, and a daughter, Agnes McMahon Johnson . After their honeymoon that included attendance at the Philadelphia Exhibition, the couple relocated to the Murray Hill neighborhood in New York City. While in New York City, Johnson's love of nature and exploration extended to outings and ramblings. He was surrounded by social friends over for musical and literary evenings and consumed all forms of art, including opera and theater. His friends from the US and abroad included Tommaso Salvini, Paderewski, the Clemenses, Kipling and Eleonora Duse. By the 1890s, Johnson and his wife became friends with the inventor Nikola Tesla, for whom Johnson wrote a poem. He also collaborated with Tesla transliterating Serbian poems by Jovan Jovanovi Zmaj in The Century Magazine.  International copyright Johnson was a proponent of the establishment of international copyright protections. As secretary of the American Copyright League, he helped get the Law of 1891 passed, for which he was decorated by the French and Italian governments. The silver fruit stand honoring his role is in the collection of the Academy of Arts Letters. Johnson s role in the creation, initial passage, and reauthorization of the act to end intellectual piracy in the US ranged from his position at The Century, as an officer of the Copyright League, lobbying Members of Congress, participation in a conference to secure support from labor unions, negotiating with the Congressional conference committee. Johnson was called the father of international copyright law.  Land preservation Johnson advocated for the forest reservation system and a scientific national policy of conservation. In 1889, camping out with naturalist John Muir at Soda Springs, Johnson encouraged Muir to start an association to help protect the Sierra Nevada, inspiring the formation of the Sierra Club in 1892.Leveraging the influence of The Century, in conjunction with Muir, Johnson was one of the driving forces behind the creation of Yosemite National Park in California in 1890 and in 1913. He served as chairman of a national commission for the preservation of that area and is credited with writing the bill. Muir dedicated his book The Yosemite to Johnson. Johnson also fought persistently though vainly against the acquisition by the city of San Francisco, California, of the Hetch Hetchy Valley as a reservoir. In 1906, in letters to President Theodore Roosevelt, he proposed a conference of governors to conserve the forests of the Eastern states, out of which grew the White House Conference on Conservation. In 2017, a plaque commemorating Johnson s role in relationship with Muir was erected at Tuolome Meadows the site where Johnson and Muir held their conversation about land preservation in 1889. Their story was recounted in Ken Burns s public television series on Our National Parks.  Hall of Fame and American Academy of Arts and Letters  As a founding director of the Hall of Fame of New York University, he helped shape its principles to instill in both Americans and foreigners, and especially in the youth, the principle of patriotism, a healthy conservatism, and reverence for the traditions of high achievement along with respect for scholarship and at the best traditions and standards; secondly, maintenance of the dignity and insistence on the value of literature and the arts; and thirdly, realization that its authority mush rest on the experience and the achievement of its members.  He became permanent secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Letters whose formation started in 1899 with Johnson successfully proposing the charter from Congress , purchase of the Venetian Renaissance home on 155th Street, NYC, and the raising of funds for an endowment noting the indebtedness to the finest Spanish scholar in America, Archer M. Huntington and culminating in 1904 . The first members to be inducted by secret ballot of their peers were William Dean Howells, Augustus Saint Gaudens, Edmund Clarence Stedman, John La Farge, Mark Twain, John Hay and Edward MacDowell. The second group inducted at the first meeting were Henry James, Charles Follen McKim, Henry Adams, Charles Eliot Norton, John Quincy Adams Ward, Thomas Raynesford Lounsbury, Theodore Roosevelt, and Thomas Bailey Aldrich. A core of fifty members was inducted and in 1908 adopted a constitution. The value of a great institution, like the value of a great personality, lies in the potentiality of its influence. Our national ideas need to be firmly established and maintained on an intellectual plane. .we also need a revival of the gospel that the glory of man is his mind and his soul; and to remember that these, as well as the body, are exposed to starvation and dwarfism and disease and blindness.  In his book entitled Remembered Yesterdays: The Temple RUG poem at the laying for the cornerstone of the Academy s permanent home. Page 439 is an accounting of the history of the Academy. Said by John Hay an Academy was more needed in our democracy than in an old world monarchy, which has its own traditions and inherited standards since here we are more subject to the tyranny of vogue. As Secretary of the American Committee, he was a driving force for the effort to acquire and preserve as the Keats Shelley museum from a museum the rooms in Rome on Spanish Steps leading up to the Santa Trinita dei Monti church where the poet John Keats and his friend Joseph Severn spent Keats's final months in 1821. Percy Shelley apparently resided temporarily in a home across the steps.  Ambassador to Italy Johnson served as the U.S. Ambassador to Italy from April 1920 to July 1921, and represented the United States as observer at the San Remo conference of the Supreme Council of the League. He was decorated by the Italian government in recognition of his work in behalf of good relations between Italy and the United States. In 1916 he acted as pallbearer for the funeral of Alexander Wilson Drake, director of the Century Magazine art department and a notable engraver from New Jersey. Johnson s activities during World War I afforded him the opportunity to present the little known facts of Italy s important contributions to the Allied cause, and that in general I had written much in prose and verse in admiration of that country and her people. In 1917 he organized and was chairman of the American Poets' Ambulances in Italy. This organization presented 112 ambulances and 37 field hospitals to the Italian army in four months built from Ford chassis from Milan. In 1918 19 he was president of the New York Committee of the Italian War Relief Fund of America and raised 235,000 which was distributed all over Italy not merely to minister to the suffering but to show Italians everywhere the sympathy and cooperation of America the blind, prevention or cure of tuberculosis among children of veterans, benevolent work of San Gregorio in Rome. After being shown a photograph of a child holding the only doll in the valley he wrote a poem by that name, sent out a press appeal and hundreds of dolls were distributed to the Val. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Italy from April 1920 to July 1921, and represented the United States as observer at the San Remo conference of the Supreme Council of the League. He was decorated by the Italian government in recognition of his work in behalf of good relations between Italy and the United States. In his first week on the job, represented the United States as observer at the San Remo conference of the Supreme Council of the League In his biography, he describes in some detail bemoaning the lack of an official record of the proceedings or decisions despite momentous topics such as Armenia, status of Constantinople, Yugoslavia, borders and troop positions in Italy, Germany as well as Palestine and the Zionists. It is amazing how frequently Italy seemed to be in the throes of an inescapable crisis, which, however, passed by like a summer storm much noise and turmoil but little damage. Informed by his research into the Civil War, he visited the lower Alps battle fields. His duties were largely socially diplomatic but also included conversations with American business interested in working in Italy including Charles M. Schwab as well as a persistent opposition to Soviet intrusions of any kind. A detailed description of the Celebration of Vittorio Veneto enemy losses topped 500,000. A description of hosting a dinner for the King and Queen of Denmark is rich in description of rituals, atmosphere and attire. Zeppelin Roma purchased by the US, extensive description of two trips. He, and apparently many in the diplomatic corps, operated independently receiving little operational funding or response to their queries from the US State Department. He was decorated by the Italian government in recognition of his work in behalf of good relations between Italy and the United States.  Honors For his service in securing an international copyright, he received the honorary A.M. degree from Yale University, the decoration of chevalier in the French Legion of Honor in 1891 and the cavaliers of the Crown of Italy in 1895. In addition, Johnson was made a commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1919, an officer of the Order of Leopold II in 1919, and the commander of the Order of St. Sava in 1920. He received the Grand Cordon Order of SS.Maurice and Lazarus , conferred by King Victor Emanuel III in 1921; was named grand officer of the French Legion of Honor in 1922; and received the grand cordon, with star, order of Polonia Restituta in 1931. A member of Phi Beta Kappa, he was also an organizer in 1904 and permanent secretary of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an outgrowth of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, of which he had also been secretary. He was a member of the National Citizens Committee of the Third Hague Conference, Independence Hall Conference to found the League to Enforce Peace, National Association of American Speech, Civil Service Reform Association, Sons of the Revolution, and the Authors, MacDowell , Century and Sierra clubs.

            "text": "A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents,: ch1 and magnetic materials. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity and to the magnetic field.: ch13 : 278 A permanent magnet's magnetic field pulls on ferromagnetic materials such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location will exert a force on a range of non magnetic materials by affecting the motion of their outer atomic electrons. Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, and are created by electric currents such as those used in electromagnets, and by electric fields varying in time. Since both strength and direction of a magnetic field may vary with location, it is described mathematically by a function assigning a vector to each point of space, called a vector field. In electromagnetics, the term magnetic field is used for two distinct but closely related vector fields denoted by the symbols B and H. In the International System of Units, H, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of ampere per meter .: 22 B, magnetic flux density, is measured in tesla ,: 21 which is equivalent to newton per meter per ampere. H and B differ in how they account for magnetization. In a vacuum, the two fields are related through the vacuum permeability,         B                     0             H       displaystyle mathbf B mu 0 mathbf H  ; but in a magnetized material, the terms differ by the material's magnetization at each point. Magnetic fields are produced by moving electric charges and the intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a fundamental quantum property, their spin.: ch1 Magnetic fields and electric fields are interrelated and are both components of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. Magnetic fields are used throughout modern technology, particularly in electrical engineering and electromechanics. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both electric motors and generators. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is conceptualized and investigated as magnetic circuits. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The Earth produces its own magnetic field, which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the solar wind and is important in navigation using a compass.  Description The force on an electric charge depends on its location, speed, and direction; two vector fields are used to describe this force.: ch1 The first is the electric field, which describes the force acting on a stationary charge and gives the component of the force that is independent of motion. The magnetic field, in contrast, describes the component of the force that is proportional to both the speed and direction of charged particles.: ch13 The field is defined by the Lorentz force law and is, at each instant, perpendicular to both the motion of the charge and the force it experiences. There are two different, but closely related vector fields which are both sometimes called the magnetic field written B and H. While both the best names for these fields and exact interpretation of what these fields represent has been the subject of long running debate, there is wide agreement about how the underlying physics work. Historically, the term magnetic field was reserved for H while using other terms for B, but many recent textbooks use the term magnetic field to describe B as well as or in place of H. There are many alternative names for both .  The B field  The magnetic field vector B at any point can be defined as the vector that, when used in the Lorentz force law, correctly predicts the force on a charged particle at that point:: 204 Here F is the force on the particle, q is the particle's electric charge, v, is the particle's velocity, and denotes the cross product. The direction of force on the charge can be determined by a mnemonic known as the right hand rule . Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field can distinguish between these, see Hall effect below. The first term in the Lorentz equation is from the theory of electrostatics, and says that a particle of charge q in an electric field E experiences an electric force: The second term is the magnetic force: Using the definition of the cross product, the magnetic force can also be written as a scalar equation:: 357 where Fmagnetic, v, and B are the scalar magnitude of their respective vectors, and is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The vector B is defined as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion of a charged particle. In other words,: 173 4 T he command, Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at such and such a place, calls for the following operations: Take a particle of known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine E. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat with v in some other direction. Now find a B that makes the Lorentz force law fit all these results that is the magnetic field at the place in question. The B field can also be defined by the torque on a magnetic dipole, m.: 174 In SI units, B is measured in teslas . In Gaussian cgs units, B is measured in gauss . One nanotesla is equivalent to 1 gamma .  The H field  The magnetic H field is defined:: 269 : 192 : ch36 Where                0          displaystyle mu 0  is the vacuum permeability, and M is the magnetization vector. In a vacuum, B and H are proportional to each other. Inside a material they are different . The H field is measured in amperes per metre in SI units, and in oersteds in cgs units.: 286  Measurement  An instrument used to measure the local magnetic field is known as a magnetometer. Important classes of magnetometers include using induction magnetometers which measure only varying magnetic fields, rotating coil magnetometers, Hall effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that is detectable in radio waves. The finest precision for a magnetic field measurement was attained by Gravity Probe B at 5 aT .  Visualization  The field can be visualized by a set of magnetic field lines, that follow the direction of the field at each point. The lines can be constructed by measuring the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of points . Then, mark each location with an arrow pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. Connecting these arrows then forms a set of magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like streamlines in fluid flow, in that they represent a continuous distribution, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the number of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly translated to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.: 237 Various phenomena display magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to field lines . Magnetic field lines are also visually displayed in polar auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field. Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. Unlike poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; like poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.  Magnetic field of permanent magnets  Permanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel, that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole. The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's strength . The equations are non trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, m points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180 degrees. The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having their own m. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles. There were two simplified models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, H and B. Outside a material, though, the two are identical so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials. A realistic model of magnetism is more complicated than either of these models; neither model fully explains why materials are magnetic. The monopole model has no experimental support. Ampere's model explains some, but not all of a material's magnetic moment. Like Ampere's model predicts, the motion of electrons within an atom are connected to those electrons' orbital magnetic dipole moment, and these orbital moments do contribute to the magnetism seen at the macroscopic level. However, the motion of electrons is not classical, and the spin magnetic moment of electrons is also a significant contribution to the total moment of magnets.  Magnetic pole model  Historically, early physics textbooks would model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. At the microscopic level, this model contradicts the experimental evidence, and the pole model of magnetism is no longer the typical way to introduce the concept.: 204 However, it is still sometimes used as a macroscopic model for ferromagnetism due to its mathematical simplicity.In this model, a magnetic H field is produced by fictitious magnetic charges that are spread over the surface of each pole. These magnetic charges are in fact related to the magnetization field M. The H field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field E, which starts at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all H field lines point away from the north pole while near the south pole all H field lines point toward the south pole . Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the H field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the H field. In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qm separated by a small distance vector d, such that m qm d. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field H both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that H is opposite to the magnetization field M inside a permanent magnet. Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a magnetic charge density, the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents, nor the inherent connection between angular momentum and magnetism. The pole model usually treats magnetic charge as a mathematical abstraction, rather than a physical property of particles. However, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle that physically has only one magnetic pole . In other words, it would possess a magnetic charge analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end. Some theories have predicted the existence of magnetic monopoles, but so far, none have been observed.  Amperian loop model  In the model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is m IA where A is the area of the loop. These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B field. The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current I and an area a. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of: where the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area a has been reduced to zero and its current I increased to infinity such that the product m Ia is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein de Haas effect rotation by magnetization and its inverse, the Barnett effect or magnetization by rotation. Rotating the loop faster increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.  Interactions with magnets   Force between magnets  Specifying the force between two small magnets is quite complicated because it depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and their distance and direction relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field of the other. To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the magnetic pole model given above. In this model, the H field of one magnet pushes and pulls on both poles of a second magnet. If this H field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform , each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque. This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way. The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted repelled into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is:: Eq. 11.42 where the gradient is the change of the quantity m B per unit distance and the direction is that of maximum increase of m B. The dot product m B mBcos , where m and B represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and is the angle between them. If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive and the gradient points uphill pulling the magnet into regions of higher B field . This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own m then summing up the forces on each of these very small regions.  Magnetic torque on permanent magnets  If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a magnetic torque on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field. In terms of the pole model, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance between them. With the definition of m as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to  0 m H sin , where 0 is a constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring 4 10 7 V s and is the angle between H and m. Mathematically, the torque on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet: where represents the vector cross product. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field, since the cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction. Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.  Interactions with electric currents Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B fields.  Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents  All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges, such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical current carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the right hand grip rule . The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. Bending a current carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or solenoid enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron core may act as an electromagnet, generating a strong, well controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil. The magnetic field generated by a steady current I is described by the Biot Savart law:: 224 where the integral sums over the wire length where vector d is the vector line element with direction in the same sense as the current I, 0 is the magnetic constant, r is the distance between the location of d and the location where the magnetic field is calculated, and r is a unit vector in the direction of r. For example, in the case of a sufficiently long, straight wire, this becomes: where r r . The direction is tangent to a circle perpendicular to the wire according to the right hand rule.: 225 A slightly more general way of relating the current       I     displaystyle I  to the B field is through Amp re's law: where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and         I      enc          displaystyle I text enc  is the current enclosed by that loop. Amp re's law is always valid for steady currents and can be used to calculate the B field for certain highly symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid. In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Amp re's law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and magnetism.  Force on moving charges and current   Force on a charged particle  A charged particle moving in a B field experiences a sideways force that is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the particle. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and is given by where F is the force, q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the instantaneous velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field . The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non elementary magnetic dipole, or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.  Force on current carrying wire  The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the Laplace force. Consider a conductor of length , cross section A, and charge q due to electric current i. If this conductor is placed in a magnetic field of magnitude B that makes an angle with the velocity of charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge q is so, for N charges where the force exerted on the conductor is where i nqvA.  Relation between H and B The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to calculate. The H field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of magnetization first.  Magnetization  The magnetization vector field M represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment m of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A m2, the SI unit of magnetization M is ampere per meter, identical to that of the H field. The magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called bound current. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet. Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law: where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and Ib is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop. In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive magnetic pole strength then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to: where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface S and qM is the magnetic charge enclosed by S. The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.  H field and magnetic materials  In SI units, the H field is related to the B field by In terms of the H field, Ampere's law is where If represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents.For the differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's law leads to the boundary condition where Kf is the surface free current density and the unit normal                     n                     displaystyle hat mathbf n   points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.Similarly, a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent of the free currents and picks out the magnetic charges within that closed surface: which does not depend on the free currents. The H field, therefore, can be separated into two independent parts: where H0 is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents. The magnetic H field, therefore, re factors the bound current in terms of magnetic charges . The H field lines loop only around free current and, unlike the magnetic B field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.  Magnetism  Most materials respond to an applied B field by producing their own magnetization M and therefore their own B fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term magnetism describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material. Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior: Diamagnetic materials produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials produce a magnetization in the same direction as the applied magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials and the closely related ferrimagnetic materials and antiferromagnetic materials can have a magnetization independent of an applied B field with a complex relationship between the two fields. Superconductors are materials that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of M on B.In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization M is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that: where is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point in the same direction as B. These relations between B and H are examples of constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex B to H relation; see magnetic hysteresis.  Stored energy  Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field. For linear, non dispersive, materials , the energy density is: If there are no magnetic materials around then can be replaced by 0. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used. In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume W needed to cause a small change of magnetic field B is: Once the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.  Appearance in Maxwell's equations  Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its sources. These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up Maxwell's Equations. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of classical electrodynamics including both electricity and magnetism. The first property is the divergence of a vector field A,  A, which represents how A flows outward from a given point. As discussed above, a B field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B is zero. This property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles. The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that  A represents how A curls or circulates around a given point. The result of the curl is called a circulation source . The equations for the curl of B and of E are called the Amp re Maxwell equation and Faraday's law respectively.  Gauss' law for magnetism  One important property of the B field produced this way is that magnetic B field lines neither start nor end ; a field line may only extend to infinity, or wrap around to form a closed curve, or follow a never ending path. Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet B field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north. If a B field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the number of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to Gauss's law for magnetism: where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface S . Since dA points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for B field pointing out and negative for B field pointing in.  Faraday's Law  A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an electric field . This is known as Faraday's law and forms the basis of many electrical generators and electric motors. Mathematically, Faraday's law is: where             E          displaystyle mathcal E  is the electromotive force and is the magnetic flux the product of the area times the magnetic field normal to that area. : 210 The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as Lenz's law. This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions.  Amp re's Law and Maxwell's correction  Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as Maxwell's correction to Amp re's law and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. The full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell Amp re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used. The Maxwell term is critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form electromagnetic waves, such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below. where J is the complete microscopic current density. As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric E field and an applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal bound charge and current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, H and D fields are used to re factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the free current density Jf: These equations are not any more general than the original equations . They also must be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between E and D. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.  Formulation in special relativity and quantum electrodynamics   Relativistic Electrodynamics   As different aspects of the same phenomenon  According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces. Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank 2 tensor, called the electromagnetic tensor. Changing reference frames mixes these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum, and energy into four momentum. Similarly, the energy stored in a magnetic field is mixed with the energy stored in an electric field in the electromagnetic stress energy tensor.  Magnetic vector potential  In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the magnetic vector potential A, and the electric scalar potential , are defined using gauge fixing such that: The vector potential, A given by this form may be interpreted as a generalized potential momentum per unit charge just as is interpreted as a generalized potential energy per unit charge. There are multiple choices one can make for the potential fields that satisfy the above condition. However, the choice of potentials is represented by its respective gauge condition. Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials in Lorentz gauge can be cast into a form that agrees with special relativity. In relativity, A together with forms a four potential regardless of the gauge condition, analogous to the four momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage of being much simpler and it can be easily modified to work with quantum mechanics.  Propagation of Electric and Magnetic fields  Special theory of relativity imposes the condition for events related by cause and effect to be time like separated, that is that causal efficacy propagates no faster than light. Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism are be found to be in favor of this as electric and magnetic disturbances are found to travel at the speed of light in space. Electric and magnetic fields from classical electrodynamics obey the principle of locality in physics and are expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the cause of a measured field originated given that the influence of field travelled at speed of light. The retarded time for a point particle is given as solution of:         t      r             t                                 r                     r              s                               c          displaystyle t r mathbf t  frac mathbf r mathbf r s  c  where             t       r             textstyle t r  is retarded time or the time at which the source's contribution of the field originated,             r         s             textstyle r s  is the position vector of the particle as function of time,         r       textstyle mathbf r  is the point in space,         t       textstyle mathbf t  is the time at which fields are measured and       c     textstyle c  is the speed of light. The equation subtracts the time taken for light to travel from particle to the point in space from the time of measurement to find time of origin of the fields. The uniqueness of solution for             t       r             textstyle t r  for given         t       displaystyle mathbf t  ,         r       displaystyle mathbf r  and         r      s             displaystyle r s  is valid for charged particles moving slower than speed of light.  Magnetic field of arbitrary moving point charge  The solution of maxwell's equations for electric and magnetic field of a point charge is expressed in terms of retarded time or the time at which the particle in the past causes the field at the point, given that the influence travels across space at the speed of light. Any arbitrary motion of point charge causes electric and magnetic fields found by solving maxwell's equations using green's function for retarded potentials and hence finding the fields to be as follows:         A                                 0            c           4                                              r                          r                 s                                                 t           t        r                                                 s                   c               displaystyle mathbf A  frac mu 0 c 4 pi left mathbf r mathbf r s  right t t r  frac boldsymbol beta  s c varphi           B                            0              4                                                      2                             3                                       r                            r                  s                                               2                                              q                  n                  s                                                                                                     s                                                                                                                           3                                       r                            r                  s                                                        t           t        r                                    n              s                   c             E          displaystyle mathbf B  frac mu 0 4 pi left gamma 2 3 mathbf r mathbf r s 2  frac q mathbf n s times Big times dot boldsymbol beta  s  big  Big  3 mathbf r mathbf r s  right t t r  frac mathbf n s c times mathbf E  where              textstyle varphi  and         A          textstyle mathbf A  are electric scalar potential and magnetic vector potential in Lorentz gauge,       q     displaystyle q  is the charge of the point source,             n         s             textstyle n s  is a unit vector pointing from charged particle to the point in space,                      s             textstyle boldsymbol beta  s  is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light and              textstyle gamma  is the corresponding Lorentz factor. Hence by the principle of superposition, the fields of a system of charges also obey principle of locality.  Quantum electrodynamics  In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a classical field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction is quantum electrodynamics , which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the Standard Model of particle physics. In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles is computed using perturbation theory. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged. Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10 12 ; for details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far. All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is negligible.  Uses and examples   Earth's magnetic field  The Earth's magnetic field is produced by convection of a liquid iron alloy in the outer core. In a dynamo process, the movements drive a feedback process in which electric currents create electric and magnetic fields that in turn act on the currents.The field at the surface of the Earth is approximately the same as if a giant bar magnet were positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11 off the rotational axis of the Earth . The north pole of a magnetic compass needle points roughly north, toward the North Magnetic Pole. However, because a magnetic pole is attracted to its opposite, the North Magnetic Pole is actually the south pole of the geomagnetic field. This confusion in terminology arises because the pole of a magnet is defined by the geographical direction it points.Earth's magnetic field is not constant the strength of the field and the location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.  Rotating magnetic fields  The rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of alternating current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his and others' early AC electric motors. Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three wire arrangement with unequal currents. This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, three phase systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three phase systems dominate the world's electrical power supply systems. Synchronous motors use DC voltage fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled and induction motors use short circuited rotors following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force. In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin.  Hall effect  The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect. The Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors .  Magnetic circuits  An important use of H is in magnetic circuits where B H inside a linear material. Here, is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result is similar in form to Ohm's law J E, where J is the current density, is the conductance and E is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law is: where                 B          d        A       textstyle Phi int mathbf B cdot mathrm d mathbf A  is the magnetic flux in the circuit,       F          H          d               textstyle F int mathbf H cdot mathrm d boldsymbol ell  is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit, and Rm is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance Rm is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux. Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of circuit theory.  Largest magnetic fields  As of October 2018, The largest magnetic field produced over a macroscopic volume outside a lab setting is 2.8 kT . As of October 2018, the largest magnetic field produced in a laboratory over a macroscopic volume was 1.2 kT by researchers at the University of Tokyo in 2018. The largest magnetic fields produced in a laboratory occur in particle accelerators, such as RHIC, inside the collisions of heavy ions, where microscopic fields reach 1014 T. Magnetars have the strongest known magnetic fields of any naturally occurring object, ranging from 0.1 to 100 GT .  History   Early developments  While magnets and some properties of magnetism were known to ancient societies, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles. Noting the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points poles in analogy to Earth's poles. He also articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.Almost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated Petrus Peregrinus's work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.: 34 Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, De Magnete, helped to establish magnetism as a science.  Mathematical development  In 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an inverse square law: 56 Charles Augustin de Coulomb experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that north and south poles cannot be separated.: 59 Building on this force between poles, Sim on Denis Poisson created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.: 64 In this model, a magnetic H field is produced by magnetic poles and magnetism is due to small pairs of north south magnetic poles. Three discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism. Hans Christian rsted demonstrated that a current carrying wire is surrounded by a circular magnetic field. Then Andr Marie Amp re showed that parallel wires with currents attract one another if the currents are in the same direction and repel if they are in opposite directions.: 87 Finally, Jean Baptiste Biot and F lix Savart announced empirical results about the forces that a current carrying long, straight wire exerted on a small magnet, determining the forces were inversely proportional to the perpendicular distance from the wire to the magnet.: 86 Laplace later deduced a law of force based on the differential action of a differential section of the wire, which became known as the Biot Savart law, as Laplace did not publish his findings.Extending these experiments, Amp re published his own successful model of magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets: 88 and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model. Further, Amp re derived both Amp re's force law describing the force between two currents and Amp re's law, which, like the Biot Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp re introduced the term electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.: 88 92 In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field, formulating what is now known as Faraday's law of induction.: 189 192 Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp re's force law.: 222 In the process, he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.: 225 In 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted H and B. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp re's model and induction.: 224 Further, he derived how H and B relate to each other and coined the term permeability.: 245 Between 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled On Physical Lines of Force in 1861. These equations were valid but incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field and demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz published papers in 1887 and 1888 experimentally confirming this fact.  Modern developments  In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor . Tesla received a patent for his electric motor in May 1888. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched rotating magnetic fields and subsequently published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin, just two months before Tesla was awarded his patent, in March 1888.The twentieth century showed that classical electrodynamics is already consistent with special relativity, and extended classical electrodynamics to work with quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. Finally, the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to form quantum electrodynamics, which first formalized the notion that electromagnetic field energy is quantized in the form of photons.

            "text": "John Pierpont Morgan Sr. was an American financier and investment banker who dominated corporate finance on Wall Street throughout the Gilded Age. As the head of the banking firm that ultimately became known as J.P. Morgan and Co., he was the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the United States spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Over the course of his career on Wall Street, J.P. Morgan spearheaded the formation of several prominent multinational corporations including U.S. Steel, International Harvester and General Electric which subsequently fell under his supervision. He and his partners also held controlling interests in numerous other American businesses including Aetna, Western Union, Pullman Car Company and 21 railroads. Due to the extent of his dominance over U.S. finance, Morgan exercised enormous influence over the nation's policies and the market forces underlying its economy. During the Panic of 1907, he organized a coalition of financiers that saved the American monetary system from collapse. As the Progressive Era's leading financier, J.P. Morgan's dedication to efficiency and modernization helped transform the shape of the American economy. Adrian Wooldridge characterized Morgan as America's greatest banker . Morgan died in Rome, Italy, in his sleep in 1913 at the age of 75, leaving his fortune and business to his son, John Pierpont Morgan Jr. Biographer Ron Chernow estimated his fortune at 80 million .  Childhood and education Morgan was born and raised in Hartford, Connecticut, to Junius Spencer Morgan and Juliet Pierpont of the influential Morgan family. Pierpont, as he preferred to be known, had a varied education due in part to his father's plans. In the fall of 1848, he transferred to the Hartford Public School, then to the Episcopal Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut , where he boarded with the principal. In September 1851, he passed the entrance exam for The English High School of Boston, which specialized in mathematics for careers in commerce. In April 1852, an illness struck Morgan which became more common as his life progressed: Rheumatic fever left him in such pain that he could not walk, and Junius sent him to the Azores to recover.He convalesced there for almost a year, then returned to Boston to resume his studies. After graduation, his father sent him to Bellerive, a school in the Swiss village of La Tour de Peilz, where he gained fluency in French. His father then sent him to the University of G ttingen to improve his German. He attained passable fluency within six months, and a degree in art history; then traveled back to London via Wiesbaden, his formal education complete.  Career   Early years and life  Morgan went into banking in 1857 at the London branch of merchant banking firm Peabody, Morgan Co., a partnership between his father and George Peabody founded three years earlier. In 1858, he moved to New York City to join the banking house of Duncan, Sherman Company, the American representatives of George Peabody and Company. During the American Civil War, in an incident known as the Hall Carbine Affair, Morgan financed the purchase of five thousand rifles from an army arsenal at 3.50 each, which were then resold to a field general for 22 each. Morgan had avoided serving during the war by paying a substitute 300 to take his place. From 1860 to 1864, as J. Pierpont Morgan Company, he acted as agent in New York for his father's firm, renamed J.S. Morgan Co. upon Peabody's retirement in 1864. From 1864 to 1872, he was a member of the firm of Dabney, Morgan, and Company. In 1871, Anthony J. Drexel founded the New York firm of Drexel, Morgan Company with his apprentice Pierpont.  J.P. Morgan Company  After the death of Anthony Drexel, the firm was rechristened J. P. Morgan Company in 1895, retaining close ties with Drexel Company of Philadelphia; Morgan, Harjes Company of Paris; and J.S. Morgan Company of London. By 1900 it was one of the world's most powerful banking houses, focused primarily on reorganizations and consolidations.Morgan had many partners over the years, such as George W. Perkins, but always remained firmly in charge. He often took over troubled business and reorganized their structures and management to return them to profitability, a process that became known as Morganization . His reputation as a banker and financier drew interest from investors to the businesses that he took over.  Railroads  In his ascent to power, Morgan focused on railroads, America's largest business enterprises. He wrested control of the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad from Jay Gould and Jim Fisk in 1869; led the syndicate that broke the government financing privileges of Jay Cooke; and developed and financed a railroad empire by reorganization and consolidation in all parts of the United States. He raised large sums in Europe; but rather than participating solely as a financier, he helped the railroads reorganize and achieve greater efficiency. He fought speculators interested only in profit and built a vision of an integrated transportation system. He successfully marketed a large part of William H. Vanderbilt's New York Central holdings in 1883. In 1885 he reorganized the New York, West Shore Buffalo Railroad, leasing it to the New York Central. In 1886 he reorganized the Philadelphia Reading, and in 1888 the Chesapeake Ohio. After Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, Morgan set up conferences in 1889 and 1890 that brought together railroad presidents to help the industry follow the new laws and write agreements for the maintenance of public, reasonable, uniform and stable rates . The first of their kind, the conferences created a community of interest among competing lines, paving the way for the great consolidations of the early 20th century. In addition, J P Morgan Co, and the banking houses which it succeeded, reorganized a large number of railroads between 1869 and 1899. Morgan also financed street railways, especially in New York City.A major political debacle came in 1904. The Northern Pacific Railway went bankrupt in the great depression of 1893. The bankruptcy wiped out the railroad's bondholders, leaving it free of debt, and a complex financial battle for its control ensued. In 1901, a compromise was reached between Morgan, New York financier E. H. Harriman and St. Paul, MN railroad builder James J. Hill. To reduce expensive competition in the Midwest, they created the Northern Securities Company to consolidate the operations of three of the region's most important railways: the Northern Pacific Railway, the Great Northern Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The consolidators ran into unexpected opposition, however, from President Theodore Roosevelt. An energetic trustbuster, Roosevelt considered the giant merger bad for consumers and a violation of the seldom enforced Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In 1902, Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue to break it up. In 1904 the Supreme Court dissolved the Northern Security company and the railroads had to go their separate, competitive ways. Morgan did not lose money on the project, but his all powerful political reputation suffered.  Treasury gold  The Federal Treasury was nearly out of gold in 1895, at the depths of the Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal government to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was not enough time to implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he claimed the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5 million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30 year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re elected in 1900.  Steel  After his father's death in 1890, Morgan took control of J. S. Morgan Co. . He began talks with Charles M. Schwab, president of Carnegie Co., and businessman Andrew Carnegie in 1900, with the goal of buying Carnegie's steel business and merging it with several other steel, coal, mining and shipping firms. After financing the creation of the Federal Steel Company, he merged it in 1901 with the Carnegie Steel Company and several other steel and iron businesses , forming the United States Steel Corporation. In 1901, U.S. Steel was the world's first billion dollar company, with an authorized capitalization of 1.4 billion, much larger than any other industrial firm and comparable in size to the largest railroads. U.S. Steel's goals were to achieve greater economies of scale, reduce transportation and resource costs, expand product lines, and improve distribution to allow the United States to compete globally with the United Kingdom and Germany. Schwab and others claimed the company's size would enable it to be more aggressive and effective in pursuing distant international markets . U.S. Steel was regarded as a monopoly by critics, as it sought to dominate not only steel but the construction of bridges, ships, railroad cars and rails, wire, nails, and many other products. With U.S. Steel, Morgan captured two thirds of the steel market, and Schwab was confident that the company would soon hold a 75 market share. However, after 1901, its market share dropped; and in 1903, Schwab resigned to form Bethlehem Steel, which became the second largest U.S. steel producer. Labor policy was a contentious issue. U.S. Steel was non union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, used aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro union troublemakers . The lawyers and bankers who had organized the merger including Morgan and CEO Elbert Gary were more concerned with long range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble. The bankers' views generally prevailed, and the result was a paternalistic labor policy.   Panic of 1907  The Panic of 1907 was a financial crisis that almost crippled the American economy. Major New York banks were on the verge of bankruptcy and there was no mechanism to rescue them, until Morgan stepped in to help resolve the crisis. Treasury Secretary George B. Cortelyou earmarked 35 million of federal money to deposit in New York banks. Morgan then met with the nation's leading financiers in his New York mansion, where he forced them to devise a plan to meet the crisis. James Stillman, president of the National City Bank, also played a central role. Morgan organized a team of bank and trust executives which redirected money between banks, secured further international lines of credit, and bought up the plummeting stocks of healthy corporations.A delicate political issue arose regarding the brokerage firm of Moore and Schley, which was deeply involved in a speculative pool in the stock of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Moore and Schley had pledged over 6 million of the Tennessee Coal and Iron stock for loans among the Wall Street banks. The banks had called the loans, and the firm could not pay. If Moore and Schley should fail, a hundred more failures would follow and then all Wall Street might go to pieces. Morgan decided they had to save Moore and Schley. TCI was one of the chief competitors of U.S. Steel, owning valuable iron and coal deposits. Morgan controlled U.S. Steel; he decided it had to buy the TCI stock from Moore and Schley. Elbert Gary, head of U.S. Steel, agreed, but was concerned there would be antitrust implications that could cause grave trouble for U.S. Steel, which was already dominant in the steel industry. Morgan sent Gary to see President Theodore Roosevelt, who promised legal immunity for the deal. U.S. Steel thereupon paid 30 million for the TCI stock and Moore and Schley was saved. The announcement had an immediate effect; by November 7, 1907, the panic was over. The crisis underscored the need for a powerful oversight mechanism.Vowing never to let it happen again, and realizing that in a future crisis there was unlikely to be another Morgan, in 1913 banking and political leaders, led by Senator Nelson Aldrich, devised a plan that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.  Banking's critics  While conservatives in the Progressive Era hailed Morgan for his civic responsibility, his strengthening of the national economy, and his devotion to the arts and religion, the left wing viewed him as one of the central figures in the system it rejected. Morgan redefined conservatism in terms of financial prowess coupled with strong commitments to religion and high culture.Enemies of banking attacked Morgan for the terms of his loan of gold to the federal government in the 1895 crisis and, together with writer Upton Sinclair, they attacked him for the financial resolution of the Panic of 1907. They also attempted to attribute to him the financial ills of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. In December 1912, Morgan testified before the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency committee. The committee ultimately concluded that a small number of financial leaders was exercising considerable control over many industries. The partners of J.P. Morgan Co. and directors of First National and National City Bank controlled aggregate resources of 22.245 billion, which Louis Brandeis, later a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, compared to the value of all the property in the twenty two states west of the Mississippi River.  Unsuccessful ventures Morgan did not always invest well, as several failures demonstrated.  Nikola Tesla  In 1900, the inventor Nikola Tesla convinced Morgan he could build a trans Atlantic wireless communication system that would outperform the short range radio wave based wireless telegraph system then being demonstrated by Guglielmo Marconi. Morgan agreed to give Tesla 150,000 to build the system in return for a 51 control of the patents. Almost as soon as the contract was signed Tesla decided to scale up the facility to include his ideas of terrestrial wireless power transmission to make what he thought was a more competitive system. Morgan considered Tesla's changes a breach of contract and refused to fund the changes. With no additional investment capital available, the project at Wardenclyffe was abandoned in 1906, and never became operational.  London Underground  Morgan suffered a rare business defeat in 1902 when he attempted to build and operate a line on the London Underground. Transit magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes thwarted Morgan's effort to obtain parliamentary authority to build the Piccadilly, City and North East London Railway, a subway line that would have competed with tube lines controlled by Yerkes. Morgan called Yerkes' coup the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of .  International Mercantile Marine  In 1902, J.P. Morgan Co. financed the formation of International Mercantile Marine Company , an Atlantic shipping company which absorbed several major American and British lines in an attempt to monopolize the shipping trade. IMMC was a holding company that controlled subsidiary corporations that had their own operating subsidiaries. Morgan hoped to dominate transatlantic shipping through interlocking directorates and contractual arrangements with the railroads, but that proved impossible because of the unscheduled nature of sea transport, American antitrust legislation, and an agreement with the British government. One of IMMC's subsidiaries was the White Star Line, which owned the RMS Titanic. The ship's famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan's death, was a financial disaster for IMMC, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMMC was over leveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow causing it to default on bond interest payments. Saved by World War I, IMMC eventually re emerged as the United States Lines, which went bankrupt in 1986.  Morgan corporations From 1890 to 1913, 42 major corporations were organized or their securities were underwritten, in whole or part, by J.P. Morgan and Company.  Manufacturing and construction industry   Railroads   Later years  Morgan was a member of the Union Club in New York City. When his friend, Erie Railroad president John King, was black balled, Morgan resigned and organized the Metropolitan Club of New York. He donated the land on 5th Avenue and 60th Street at a cost of 125,000, and commanded Stanford White to ...build me a club fit for gentlemen, forget the expense... He invited King in as a charter member and served as club president from 1891 to 1900.  Personal life   Marriages and children  In 1861, Morgan married Amelia Sturges, called Mimi . He married Frances Louisa Fanny Tracy , on May 31, 1865. They had four children: Louisa Pierpont Morgan , who married Herbert L. Satterlee J. P. Morgan Jr. , who married Jane Norton Grew Juliet Pierpont Morgan , who married William Pierson Hamilton Anne Tracy Morgan , philanthropist  Appearance  Morgan often had a tremendous physical effect on people; one man said that a visit from Morgan left him feeling as if a gale had blown through the house. He was physically large with massive shoulders, piercing eyes, and a purple nose. He was known to dislike publicity and hated being photographed without his permission; as a result of his self consciousness of his rosacea, all of his professional portraits were retouched. His deformed nose was due to a disease called rhinophyma, which can result from rosacea. As the deformity worsens, pits, nodules, fissures, lobulations, and pedunculation contort the nose. This condition inspired the crude taunt Johnny Morgan's nasal organ has a purple hue. Surgeons could have shaved away the rhinophymous growth of sebaceous tissue during Morgan's lifetime, but as a child he suffered from infantile seizures, and Morgan's son in law, Herbert L. Satterlee, has speculated that he did not seek surgery for his nose because he feared the seizures would return.His social and professional self confidence were too well established to be undermined by this affliction. It appeared as if he dared people to meet him squarely and not shrink from the sight, asserting the force of his character over the ugliness of his face.  Religion  Morgan was a lifelong member of the Episcopal Church, and by 1890 was one of its most influential leaders. He was a founding member of the Church Club of New York, an Episcopal private member's club in Manhattan. In 1910, the General Convention of the Episcopal Church established a commission, proposed by Bishop Charles Brent, to implement a world conference of churches to address their differences in their faith and order. Morgan was so impressed by the proposal for such a conference that he contributed 100,000 to finance the commission's work.  Homes  His house at 219 Madison Avenue was originally built in 1853 by John Jay Phelps and purchased by Morgan in 1882. It became the first electrically lit private residence in New York. His interest in the new technology was a result of his financing Thomas Alva Edison's Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1878. It was there that a reception of 1,000 people was held for the marriage of Juliet Morgan and William Pierson Hamilton on April 12, 1894, where they were given a favorite clock of Morgan's. Morgan also owned the Cragston estate, located in Highland Falls, New York. His son, of the same name, was the owner of East Island in Glen Cove, New York.J.P. Morgan spent three months of every year in London and owned two houses there. His 'town' house, 13 Prince's Gate was inherited from his father and was later expanded by the acquisition of the neighbouring Number 14 to house his growing art collection. After his death the merged houses were offered to the US government for use as the residence of the US Ambassador, from 1929 to 1955. His other property was Dover House, Putney, which was later demolished and developed into the Dover House Estate.  Yachting  An avid yachtsman, Morgan owned several large yachts, the first being the Corsair, built by William Cramp Sons for Charles J. Osborn and launched on May 26, 1880. Charles J. Osborn was Jay Gould's private banker. Morgan bought the yacht in 1882. The well known quote, If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it is commonly attributed to Morgan in response to a question about the cost of maintaining a yacht, although the story is unconfirmed. A similarly unconfirmed legend attributes the quote to his son, J. P. Morgan Jr., in connection with the launching of the son's yacht Corsair IV at Bath Iron Works in 1930. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the ill fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, but canceled at the last minute, choosing to remain at a resort in Aix les Bains, France. The White Star Line, which operated Titanic, was part of Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Company, and Morgan was to have his own private suite and promenade deck on the ship. In response to the sinking of Titanic, Morgan purportedly said: Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death.  Collector  Morgan was a collector of books, pictures, paintings, clocks and other art objects, many loaned or given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and many housed in his London house and in his private library on 36th Street, near Madison Avenue in New York City. For a number of years the British artist and art critic Roger Fry worked for the museum, and in effect for Morgan, as a collector.His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., made the Pierpont Morgan Library a public institution in 1924 as a memorial to his father, and kept Belle da Costa Greene, his father's private librarian, as its first director.  Benefactor  Morgan was a benefactor of the Morgan Library and Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, Groton School, Harvard University , Trinity College, the Lying in Hospital of the City of New York, and the New York trade schools.  Gem collector  By the turn of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most important collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones . Tiffany Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief Gemologist, George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.George Frederick Kunz continued to build a second, even finer, collection which was exhibited in Paris in 1900. These collections have been donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where they were known as the Morgan Tiffany and the Morgan Bement collections. In 1911 Kunz named a newly found gem after his best customer morganite.  Photography  Morgan was a patron to photographer Edward S. Curtis, offering Curtis 75,000 in 1906, to create a series on the American Indians. Curtis eventually published a 20 volume work entitled The North American Indian. Curtis also produced a motion picture, In the Land of the Head Hunters , which was restored in 1974 and re released as In the Land of the War Canoes. Curtis was also famous for a 1911 magic lantern slide show The Indian Picture Opera which used his photos and original musical compositions by composer Henry F. Gilbert.  Other  Morgan smoked dozens of cigars per day and favored large Havana cigars dubbed Hercules' Clubs by observers.  Death  Morgan died while traveling abroad on March 31, 1913, just shy of his 76th birthday. He died in his sleep at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome, Italy. His body was brought back to America aboard the SS France, a French Line passenger ship. Flags on Wall Street flew at half staff, and in an honor usually reserved for heads of state, the stock market closed for two hours when his body passed through New York City. His body was brought to lie in his home and adjacent library the first night of arrival in New York City. His remains were interred in the Cedar Hill Cemetery in his birthplace of Hartford, Connecticut. His son, John Pierpont Jack Morgan Jr., inherited the banking business. He bequeathed his mansion and large book collections to the Morgan Library Museum in New York. His estate was worth 68.3 million , of which about 30 million represented his share in the New York and Philadelphia banks. The value of his art collection was estimated at 50 million.  Legacy His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., took over the business at his father's death, but was never as influential. As required by the 1933 Glass Steagall Act, the House of Morgan became three entities: J.P. Morgan Co., which later became Morgan Guaranty Trust; Morgan Stanley, an investment house formed by his grandson Henry Sturgis Morgan; and Morgan Grenfell in London, an overseas securities house. The gemstone morganite was named in his honor.The Cragston Dependencies, associated with his estate, Cragston , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  Popular culture A contemporary literary biography of Morgan is used as an allegory for the financial environment in America after World War I in the second volume, Nineteen Nineteen, of John Dos Passos' U.S.A. trilogy. Morgan appears as a character in Caleb Carr's novel The Alienist, in E. L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime, in Steven S. Drachman's novel The Ghosts of Watt O'Hugh, in Graham Moore's novel The Last Days of Night, and in Marie Bendedict and Victoria Christopher Murray's novel, The Personal Librarian.Morgan is believed to have been the model for Walter Parks Thatcher , guardian of the young Citizen Kane with whom he has a tense relationship Kane blaming Thatcher for destroying his childhood. According to Phil Orbanes, former vice president of Parker Brothers, the Rich Uncle Pennybags of the American version of the board game Monopoly is modeled after J. P. Morgan.The family of the illustrator Daniel Fox, who in 1936 created the mascot for the game, have accredited J. P. Morgan as being the inspiration for the character. Morgan's career is highlighted in episodes three and four of the History Channel's The Men Who Built America. My Name Is Morgan  1906 popular song released as an Edison cylinder recording, words by Will A. Mahoney, music by Halsey K. Mohr, sung by Bob Roberts. Originally released as a coon song but revised over the years, a poor man named Morgan tells his girlfriend not to mistake him for a rich man.

            "text": "The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla is a book compiled and edited by Thomas Commerford Martin detailing the work of Nikola Tesla through 1893. The book is a comprehensive compilation of Tesla's early work with many illustrations.  Overview Written in 1893, the book is a record of Tesla's pioneering activities, research, and works. Tesla is recognized as one of the foremost electrical researchers and inventors. At the time of publication, the book was the bible of every electrical engineer practicing the profession. The book contains Forty three chapters, most of them on different areas of Tesla's research and inventions by Tesla. The first chapter is a brief biography while three chapters are transcripts of important lectures and one covers his section of Westinghouse's exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair Martin stated that, No attempt whatever has been made here to emphasize the importance of his researches and discoveries . The ideas and inventions are conveyed in their own way, determining by their own place by intrinsic merit. But with the fact that Tesla blazed a path that electrical development would later follow for years to come, the compiler of the book endeavored to bring together all of Tesla's work up to that point in Tesla's life. Aside from indicating the range of his thought and originality of his mind, the book has historical value because it describes the scope of Tesla's early inventions.  Publication Upon securing the deal to publish the book, Thomas Commerford Martin was praised by his contemporaries as having executed a brilliant stratagem in closing the deal to publish a book which would be a landmark in the electrical sciences. Martin and Tesla both profited from sales of the book, but Tesla insisted that copies had to be given out freely. Tesla was unconcerned with the financial aspect of the book but though in the future it would make a good amount of money.  Editions  1894 The Electrical Engineer , New York, 2nd edition, copyright expired, scanned copy available online 1995 Barnes Noble 496 page reprint ISBN 0 88029 812 X casebound, ISBN 1 56619 812 7 paperback 2014 Barnes Noble ISBN 978 1 4351 6795 7 leatherbound Multiple other versions available  Analysis Edwin Armstrong, the inventor of FM radio, commented on the importance of the book and stated in the middle of the 20th century: Who today can read a copy of The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla, published before the turn of the century, without being fascinated by the beauty of the experiments described and struck with admiration for Tesla's extraordinary insight into the nature of the phenomena with which he was dealing? Who now can realize the difficulties he must have had to overcome in those early days? But one can imagine the inspirational effect of the book forty years ago on a boy about to decide to study the electrical art. Its effect was both profound and decisive.  Citations Margaret Cheney, in Tesla: Man Out of Time, used the text of the book to call attention to the fact that Tesla indicated that one of the uses of the experimental equipment would be for the professional field of harmonic and synchronous telegraphy and that vast possibilities are again opened up for the radio arts of the time.In Nikola Tesla and John Jacob Astor by Marc J. Seifer, Seifer writes of Tesla answering what is the spark of life: Thus, everything that exists, organic or inorganic, animated or inert, is susceptible to stimulus from the outside. There is no gap between, no break in continuity, no special and distinguishing vital agent. The momentous question of Spencer, What is it that causes inorganic matter to run into organic forms? has been answered. It is the sun's heat and light. Wherever they are there is life.

            "text": "The Tesla Experimental Station was a laboratory in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA built in 1899 by inventor Nikola Tesla and for his study of the use of high voltage, high frequency electricity in wireless power transmission. Tesla used it for only one year, until 1900, and it was torn down in 1904 to pay his outstanding debts.  History  In May 1899, Tesla, several of his assistants, and a local contractor commenced the construction of Tesla's laboratory shortly after arriving in Colorado Springs, a high altitude location where he would have more room than in his downtown New York City laboratory for his high voltage, high frequency experiments. Tesla moved there to study the conductive nature of low pressure air, part of his research into wireless transmission of electrical power. The lab possessed the largest Tesla coil ever built, 49.25 feet in diameter, which was a preliminary version of the magnifying transmitter planned for installation in the Wardenclyffe Tower. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris. He produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings. While experimenting, Tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator, causing a power outage. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house 6 miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation! During his time at his laboratory Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded might be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to reporter Julian Hawthorne at the Philadelphia North American on 8 December 1899 and in a December 1900 letter about possible discoveries in the new century to the Red Cross Society where he referred to messages from another world that read 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... . Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article Talking With Planets where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing intelligently controlled signals and that the signals could come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Marconi's European experiments in July 1899 Marconi may have transmitted the letter S in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.On 7 January 1900 Tesla made his final entry in his journal while in Colorado Springs. In 1904 Tesla was sued for unpaid bills in Colorado Springs, his lab was torn down in that year, and its contents were sold two years later in an auction at the court house to satisfy his debts.  Location The Experimental Station was located on empty land on the highest local point between the 1876 Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind and the Union Printers Home, where Tesla conducted the research described in the Colorado Springs Notes, 1899 1900. A few papers of the times listed Tesla's lab as about 200 feet east of the Deaf and Blind School and 200 feet north of Pikes Peak Avenue. This put it on top of the hill at E. Kiowa Street and N. Foote Avenue , as documented by Pikes Peak Library District.  See also Wardenclyffe Tower  References",

            "text": "Radio control is the use of control signals transmitted by radio to remotely control a device. Examples of simple radio control systems are garage door openers and keyless entry systems for vehicles, in which a small handheld radio transmitter unlocks or opens doors. Radio control is also used for control of model vehicles from a hand held radio transmitter. Industrial, military, and scientific research organizations make use of radio controlled vehicles as well. A rapidly growing application is control of unmanned aerial vehicles for both civilian and military uses, although these have more sophisticated control systems than traditional applications.  History  The idea of controlling unmanned vehicles predates the invention of radio. The latter half of the 1800s saw development of many such devices, connected to an operator by wires, including the first practical application invented by German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1870.Getting rid of the wires via using a new wireless technology, radio, appeared in the late 1890s. In 1897 British engineer Ernest Wilson and C. J. Evans patented a radio controlled torpedo or demonstrated remote radio control boats on the Thames river . At an 1898 exhibition at Madison Square Garden, Nikola Tesla demonstrated a small unmanned boat that used a coherer based radio control. With an eye towards selling the idea to the US government as a torpedo, Tesla's 1898 patent included a clockwork frequency changer so an enemy couldn't take control of the device. In 1903, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres y Quevedo introduced a radio based control system called the Telekino at the Paris Academy of Science. In the same year, he obtained a patent in France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States. It was intended as a way of testing a dirigible of his own design without risking human lives. To avoid the expense of conceivably crashing his airship prototype he built his demonstration device into a boat. Unlike the previous systems, which carried out actions of the 'on off' type, Torres device was able to memorize the signals received to execute the operations on its own and could carry out to 19 different orders. In 1906, in the presence of an audience which included the King of Spain, Torres demonstrated the invention in the Port of Bilbao, guiding a boat from the shore with people on board. Later, he would try to apply the Telekino to projectiles and torpedoes but had to abandon the project for lack of financing.In 1904, Bat, a Windermere steam launch, was controlled using experimental radio control by its inventor, Jack Kitchen . In 1909 the French inventor Gabet demonstrated what he called his Torpille Radio Automatique , a radio controlled torpedo.In 1917, Archibald Low as head of the secret RFC experimental works at Feltham, was the first person to use radio control successfully on an aircraft, an Aerial Target . It was piloted from the ground by future world aerial speed record holder Henry Segrave. Low's systems encoded the command transmissions as a countermeasure to prevent enemy intervention. By 1918 the secret D.C.B. Section of the Royal Navy's Signals School, Portsmouth under the command of Eric Robinson V.C. used a variant of the Aerial Target s radio control system to control from mother aircraft different types of naval vessels including a submarine. During World War I American inventor John Hays Hammond, Jr. developed many techniques used in subsequent radio control including developing remote controlled torpedoes, ships, anti jamming systems and even a system allowing his remote controlled ship targeting an enemy ship's searchlights. In 1922 he installed radio control gear on the obsolete US Navy battleship USS Iowa so it could be used as a target ship . The Soviet Red Army used remotely controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and fielded at least two teletank battalions at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500 1,500 m, the two constituting a telemechanical group. There were also remotely controlled cutters and experimental remotely controlled planes in the Red Army. The United Kingdom's World War One development of their radio controlled 1917 'Aerial Target' and 1918 'Distant Control Boat' using Low's control systems led eventually to their 1930s fleet of Queen Bee . This was a remotely controlled unmanned version of the de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft for Navy fleet gunnery firing practice. The Queen Bee was superseded by the similarly named Queen Wasp, a purpose built, target aircraft of higher performance.  Second World War Radio control was further developed during World War II, primarily by the Germans who used it in a number of missile projects. Their main effort was the development of radio controlled missiles and glide bombs for use against shipping, a target otherwise both difficult and dangerous to attack. However, by the end of the war, the Luftwaffe was having similar problems attacking Allied bombers and developed a number of radio command guided anti aircraft missiles, none of which saw service. The effectiveness of the Luftwaffe's systems, primarily comprising the series of Telefunken Funk Ger t 203 Kehl twin axis, single joystick equipped transmitters mounted in the deploying aircraft, and Telefunken's companion FuG 230 Stra burg receiver placed in the ordnance to be controlled during deployment and used by both the Fritz X unpowered, armored anti ship bomb, and the powered Henschel Hs 293 guided bomb, was greatly reduced by British efforts to jam their radio signals, eventually with American assistance. After initial successes, the British launched a number of commando raids to collect the missile radio sets. Jammers were then installed on British ships, and the weapons basically stopped working . The German development teams then turned to wire guidance once they realized what was going on, but the systems were not ready for deployment until the war had already moved to France. The German Kriegsmarine operated FL Boote which were radio controlled motor boats filled with explosives to attack enemy shipping from 1944. Both the British and US also developed radio control systems for similar tasks, to avoid the huge anti aircraft batteries set up around German targets. However, no system proved usable in practice, and the one major US effort, Operation Aphrodite, proved to be far more dangerous to its users than to the target. The American Azon guided free fall ordnance, however, proved useful in both the European and CBI Theaters of World War II. Radio control systems of this era were generally electromechanical in nature, using small metal fingers or reeds with different resonant frequencies each of which would operate one of a number of different relays when a particular frequency was received. The relays would in turn then activate various actuators acting on the control surfaces of the missile. The controller's radio transmitter would transmit the different frequencies in response to the movements of a control stick; these were typically on off signals. The radio gear used to control the rudder function on the American developed Azon guided ordnance, however, was a fully proportional control, with the ailerons , solely under the control of an on board gyroscope, serving merely to keep the ordnance from rolling. These systems were widely used until the 1960s, when the increasing use of solid state systems greatly simplified radio control. The electromechanical systems using reed relays were replaced by similar electronic ones, and the continued miniaturization of electronics allowed more signals, referred to as control channels, to be packed into the same package. While early control systems might have two or three channels using amplitude modulation, modern systems include 20 or more using frequency modulation.  Radio controlled models  The first general use of radio control systems in models started in the early 1950s with single channel self built equipment; commercial equipment came later. The advent of transistors greatly reduced the battery requirements, since the current requirements at low voltage were greatly reduced and the high voltage battery was eliminated. In both tube and early transistor sets the model's control surfaces were usually operated by an electromagnetic 'escapement' controlling the stored energy in a rubber band loop, allowing simple on off rudder control and sometimes other functions such as motor speed.Crystal controlled superheterodyne receivers with better selectivity and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. Multi channel developments were of particular use to aircraft, which really needed a minimum of three control dimensions , as opposed to boats, which required only two or one. As the electronics revolution took off, single signal channel circuit design became redundant, and instead radios provided proportionally coded signal streams which a servomechanism could interpret, using pulse width modulation . More recently, high end hobby systems using pulse code modulation features have come on the market that provide a computerized digital bit stream signal to the receiving device, instead of the earlier PWM encoding type. However, even with this coding, loss of transmission during flight has become more common, in part because of the ever more wireless society. Some more modern FM signal receivers that still use PWM encoding instead can, thanks to the use of more advanced computer chips in them, be made to lock onto and use the individual signal characteristics of a particular PWM type RC transmitter's emissions alone, without needing a special code transmitted along with the control information as PCM encoding has always required. In the early 21st century, 2.4 gigahertz spread spectrum RC control systems have become increasingly utilized in control of model vehicles and aircraft. Now, these 2.4 GHz systems are being made by most radio manufacturers. These radio systems range in price from a couple thousand dollars, all the way down to under US 30 for some. Some manufacturers even offer conversion kits for older digital 72 MHz or 35 MHz receivers and radios. As the emerging multitude of 2.4 GHz band spread spectrum RC systems usually use a frequency agile mode of operations, like FHSS that do not stay on one set frequency any longer while in use, the older exclusive use provisions at model flying sites needed for VHF band RC control systems' frequency control, for VHF band RC systems that only used one set frequency unless serviced to change it, are not as mandatory as before.  Modern military and aerospace applications  Remote control military applications are typically not radio control in the direct sense, directly operating flight control surfaces and propulsion power settings, but instead take the form of instructions sent to a completely autonomous, computerized automatic pilot. Instead of a turn left signal that is applied until the aircraft is flying in the right direction, the system sends a single instruction that says fly to this point . Some of the most outstanding examples of remote radio control of a vehicle are the Mars Exploration Rovers such as Sojourner.  Industrial radio remote control Today radio control is used in industry for such devices as overhead cranes and switchyard locomotives. Radio controlled teleoperators are used for such purposes as inspections, and special vehicles for disarming of bombs. Some remotely controlled devices are loosely called robots, but are more properly categorized as teleoperators since they do not operate autonomously, but only under control of a human operator. An industrial radio remote control can either be operated by a person, or by a computer control system in a machine to machine mode. For example, an automated warehouse may use a radio controlled crane that is operated by a computer to retrieve a particular item. Industrial radio controls for some applications, such as lifting machinery, are required to be of a fail safe design in many jurisdictions.Industrial remote controls work differently from most consumer products. When the receiver receives the radio signal which the transmitter sent, it checks it so that it is the correct frequency and that any security codes match. Once the verification is complete, the receiver sends an instruction to a relay which is activated. The relay activates a function in the application corresponding to the transmitters button. This could be to engage an electrical directional motor in an overhead crane. In a receiver there are usually several relays, and in something as complex as an overhead crane, perhaps up to 12 or more relays are required to control all directions. In a receiver which opens a gate, two relays are often sufficient.Industrial remote controls are getting more and higher safety requirements. For example: a remote control may not lose the safety functionality in case of malfunction. This can be avoided by using redundant relays with forced contacts.

            "text": "Ivan Me trovi ; 15 August 1883 16 January 1962 was a Croatian sculptor, architect, and writer. He was the most prominent modern Croatian sculptor and a leading artistic personality in contemporary Zagreb. He studied at Pavle Bilini 's Stone Workshop in Split and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he was formed under the influence of the Secession. He traveled throughout Europe and studied the works of ancient and Renaissance masters, especially Michelangelo, and French sculptors Auguste Rodin, Antoine Bourdelle and Aristide Maillol. He was the initiator of the national romantic group Meduli . During the First World War, he lived in emigration. After the war, he returned to Croatia and began a long and fruitful period of sculpture and pedagogical work. In 1942 he emigrated to Italy, in 1943 to Switzerland and in 1947 to the United States. He was a professor of sculpture at the Syracuse University and from 1955 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Most of his early works of symbolic themes were formed in the spirit of the Secession, some of which, like the Well of Life, show impressionist restless surfaces created under the influence of Rodin's naturalism, and the second, reviving national myth, become stylized monumental plastics . Before the First World War, he left pathetic epic stylization, expressing increasingly emotional states, as evidenced by the wooden reliefs of biblical themes made in a combination of Archaic, Gothic, Secessionist and Expressionist styles. During the 1920s and 1930s, the classical component prevailed in his works. In this period, he created a number of public monuments of strong plastic expression, pronounced and legible shapes . Portraits take a special place in his opus. Me trovi achieved works of strong plastic value in the construction sculptural monuments and projects, mostly with central layout . He also designed a memorial church of King Zvonimir in Biskupija near Knin inspired by old Croatian churches, a representative family palace, today the Ivan Me trovi Gallery, and reconstructed renaissance fortified mansion Crikvine Ka tilac in Split.  Life   Early life  He was born in Vrpolje, Slavonia, and spent his childhood in the small Dalmatian village of Otavice, the native place of his parents in the Dinaric Alps. His father was a poor peasant and sheep breeder. At the age of sixteen he was accepted as an apprentice by Pavle Blini , a master of a stonemasonry in Split.His artistic skills were improved by studying the monumental buildings in the city and his education at the hands of Bilini 's wife, who was a high school teacher. Soon, they found a mine owner from Vienna who paid for Me trovi to move there and be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Edmund von Hellmer and Otto Wagner. Quickly he had to learn German from scratch and adjust to the new environment, but he persevered and successfully finished his studies. In 1905 he had his first exhibit with the Secession Group in Vienna, noticeably influenced by the Art Nouveau style. His work quickly became popular, even with the likes of Auguste Rodin who once said that Me trovi is the greatest phenomenon among sculptors and even greater sculptor than he was. Because of that popularity he soon earned enough for him and his wife , Ru a Klein, to travel to more international exhibitions. In 1908 Me trovi moved to Paris and the sculptures made in this period earned him international reputation. At this time, Ivan was a friend of the cubist painter Jelena Dorotka . In 1911 he moved to Zagreb, and soon after to Rome where he received the grand prix for the Serbian Pavilion on the 1911 Rome International Exhibition. There his work was praised as being strong and monumental compared to the soft and ineffectual pieces exhibited by his contemporaries, Hugo Lederer, Anton Hanak, and Franz Metzner. He remained in Rome, spending four years studying ancient Greek sculpture. Me trovi became a supporter of Yugoslavism and Yugoslav identity after he traveled to Serbia and became impressed with Serb culture. He created a sculpture of Serbian folk legend hero Prince Marko for the International Exhibition of Art , which was exhibited along with 73 sculptures at the pavilion of Kingdom of Serbia. When asked about the statue, Me trovi replied This Marko is our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart . Me trovi wrote poetry speaking of a Yugoslav race . Those who knew Me trovi 's views referred to him as The Prophet of Yugoslavism .  First World War and Yugoslavia  At the onset of World War I, after the assassination in Sarajevo, Me trovi tried to move back to Split via Venice, but was dissuaded by threats made against him because of his political opposition to the Austro Hungarian authorities. During the war he travelled to present exhibits in Paris, Cannes, London and in Switzerland. He was a founding member of the Yugoslav Committee. He was the first artist of Croatian origin to exhibit his work at the Victoria Albert Museum in London, in 1915. After World War I he moved back home to the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and met the second love of his life, Olga Kester anek, whom he married shortly thereafter. They had four children: Marta, Tvrtko, Maria and Mate, all of whom were born in Zagreb, where Ivan and Olga settled in 1922. He was a contemporary and friend of Nikola Tesla. Me trovi and his family would later spend the winter months in their mansion in Zagreb and the summer months in a summer house he built by the end of the 1930s in Split. He became a professor and later the director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, and proceeded to build numerous internationally renowned works as well as many donated chapels and churches and grants to art students. By 1923 he designed the mausoleum for the Ra i Family Memorial Chapel in Cavtat, also known as Our Lady of the Angels. He also created a set of statues for a never built Yugoslav national temple that would have been erected in Kosovo to commemorate the 1389 Battle of Kosovo. Me trovi sculpted numerous sculptures commissioned by the Kara or evi dynasty, especially Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Among the orders of King Alexander are sculptures of a sphinx, Milo Obili , Marko Kraljevi , the hero of the Kosovo myth Sr o Zlopogle a, sculptures of female counterparts to Kosovo's heroes, as well as a self portrait of Me trovi . Most of the commissioned sculptures had the idea of an integral Yugoslav nation as ideological background. Today, the works are mostly located within the royal compound in Dedinje. Me trovi had a role in the constitution of Yugoslav national identity.He continued to travel to post his exhibits around the world: he displayed at the Brooklyn Museum in New York in 1924, in Chicago in 1925, he even travelled to Egypt and Palestine in 1927. In 1927 he entered a design for the coins of the Irish Free State, and though his design arrived too late for consideration it was adopted in 1965 as the seal of the Central Bank of Ireland.  Second World War  During the April War in 1941 Me trovi was living in Split. After being warned by novelist and Independent State of Croatia minister Mile Budak that the Croatian authorities could not guarantee his safety in Split, he moved to Zagreb in September 1941. Me trovi and painter Jozo Kljakovi were arrested by the Usta e in Zagreb on 7 November 1941, ostensibly due to the regime's fears that the two would emigrate. He eventually served three and a half months in the Savska Cesta prison. With help from archbishop Aloysius Stepinac and subsequently the Vatican he was released, on condition that he travel to Venice to attend the Independent State of Croatia pavilion at the Venice Biennale. From there he relocated to Rome, where he stayed and worked at the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome. He was sponsored here by Fra Dominik Mandi , and during his time in the city was received by Pope Pius XII. In July 1943, Me trovi secured a visa to Switzerland through NDH diplomat Stijepo Peri and moved there. Not all of his family managed to escape his first wife Ru a died in 1942 and many from her Jewish family were murdered in the Holocaust. Later, his brother Petar was imprisoned for publicly advising Ivan not to return to the country. Marshal Josip Broz Tito's government in Yugoslavia eventually invited Me trovi to return, but he refused to do so. In 1946, Syracuse University offered him a professorship, and he moved to the United States. He became the first artist of Croatian origin to exhibit his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1947.From 1951 he began making contributions to the Croatian emigrant journal Hrvatska revija, which would later publish his memoirs. He was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Gold Medal for sculpture in 1953. President Dwight D. Eisenhower personally presided over the 1954 ceremony granting Me trovi American citizenship. He went on to become a professor at the University of Notre Dame in 1955.At the end of January 1951 Me trovi joined the American campaign for the release of Archbishop Stepinac from prison.  Later years  Before he died, Me trovi returned to Yugoslavia one last time to visit with the imprisoned Cardinal Stepinac and with Tito. At the request of various people from his homeland he sent 59 statues from the United States to Yugoslavia , and in 1952 signed off his Croatian estates to the people of Croatia, including more than 400 sculptures and numerous drawings. Upon his return he vowed to his colleague painter Jozo Kljakovi that he would not return to the country as long as the communists were in power. Two of his children predeceased him. His daughter Marta, who moved with him to the U.S., died in 1949 at the age of 24. His son Tvrtko, who remained in Zagreb, was 39 when he died in 1961. In 1960 he suffered a minor stroke which affected his eyesight. In 1961, his memoir, Uspomene na politi ke ljude i doga aje , was published by the Croatian emigrant publishing house Hrvatska revija in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1969, they were published by Matica hrvatska in Zagreb. After creating four clay sculptures to memorialize his children, Me trovi died in early 1962, aged 79, in South Bend, Indiana. His funeral mass was celebrated by the bishops of ibenik, Josip Arneri , and bishop of Split Makarska Frane Frani . His remains were interred at a mausoleum in his childhood home of Otavice. Communist Yugoslav authorities had originally promised the Me trovi family that his remains could lie in repose at the cathedrals in Zagreb and Split. Once his remains had arrived in Yugoslavia, however, the authorities reneged and did not allow this to take place. After communist officials interfered during his funeral, his son Mate Me trovi sharply criticized the level of religious freedom in the country.His son, Mate, is a Croatian American diplomat, university professor and editor at Time magazine, who served as a lieutenant in the US Army PsyWar. Later, he served as president of the Croatian National Congress and lobbied on behalf of Croatian self determination in Washington, D.C., Western Europe and Australia, and was a deputy in the Croatian Parliament, a member of Croatia's delegation to the Council of Europe, and the Inter Parliamentary Union. He also served as an ambassador in the Foreign Ministry.Me trovi 's grandson Stjepan is an American sociology professor at Texas A M and author of several books.  Reputation and legacy  His sculptural strengths are manifested in the lyrical and dramatic expression of the human body. Critics in Europe and the United States ranked him highly in the first half of the 20th century. He is one of the most prominent Croatian artists whose work has at times gained worldwide recognition. Professor Miljenko Jurkovic of the University of Zagreb states he: is the most renowned modern Croatian sculptor. His works combine various influences, and they are both monumental and poetic. He sculpted in stone, bronze and wood, covering a diverse range of themes spreading to religious, portraits and symbolic themes.Historians Wojciech Roszkowski and Jan Kofman report: Me trovi 's sculpture of the 1389 Battle of Kosovo Field won first prize at an international exhibition in 1911, and critics acclaimed him the greatest sculptor of modern times. Auguste Rodin's evaluation was often quoted: Me trovi was the greatest phenomena among the sculptors of his time.Alonzo Lansford, editor of Arts Magazine in New York City, reviewed the Mestrovic show of 1947 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He wrote: It is therefore singularly significant that he is almost unanimously revered by American sculptors of all schools as one of the greatest living sculptors. Several streets in Serbia are named after him.  Work  Me trovic created over fifty monuments during his two years in Paris . The theme of the Battle of Kosovo particularly moved him, prompting one of his first great works, the Paris Kosovo Monument, as well as other works in bronze and stone. Much of his early work commemorated such epic moments from Slavic history, as he attempted to foster the pan Slavic cause in his native country. With the creation of the first Yugoslavia, Me trovi 's focus shifted to more mundane topics such as musical instruments or chapels. He particularly oriented himself towards religious items, mostly made of wood, under artistic influence from the Byzantine and Gothic architecture. The most renowned works from his early period are the Crucifix and Madonna; later he became inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti and created a large number of stone reliefs and portraits. The Croatian dinar featured Me trovi 's work History of the Croats.Me trovi 's most famous monuments include: Canadian Phalanx, a marble relief, 284 Wellington Street in Ottawa, Ontario Gregory of Nin in Split Josip Juraj Strossmayer in Zagreb Monument of Gratitude to France in Belgrade Monument to the Unknown Hero, Avala, Belgrade Victor monument on Kalemegdan Fortress in Belgrade Svetozar Mileti in Novi Sad Nade da Petrovi in a ak Nikola Tesla in Zagreb Mausoleum of Njego on Mount Lov en in Montenegro The Spring of Life in Zagreb Domagoj's Archers in Zagreb The Bowman and The Spearman in Chicago Martin Kuku n in the Medical Garden, Bratislava, Slovakia Ion I.

            "text": "Henry Sutton was an Australian designer, engineer, and inventor credited with contributions to early developments in electricity, aviation, wireless communication, photography and telephony.: 10  Early life   Family  Henry Sutton, the second of the eleven children of Richard Henry Sutton , and Mary Sutton , n e Johnson, was born in a tent on the Ballarat goldfields on 4 September 1855.: 3 He had three brothers, with whom he was associated in the Sutton Brothers musical business originally centred on Ballarat, and two sisters. He married Elizabeth Ellen Wyatt in 1881, and Annie May Tatti , on 17 September 1902, who bore four and two sons, respectively.: 371  Education  Up to the age of ten, Sutton was schooled by his mother, then attended a state school, and then Gracefield college between 1869 and 1872.: 23 Sutton was self taught in the field of science, having read all the available books in library of the Ballarat Mechanics lnstitute by the age of 14.Sutton trained as a draftsman at the Ballarat School of Design: 18 where he won a silver medal and 30 other prizes for drawing.Sutton studied at the Ballarat School of Mines.  Ballarat Sutton lectured at the Ballarat School of Mines from 1883 to 1886. In 1883, as a consequence of his work on batteries, Sutton was admitted as an associate of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians.: 50, 57 M. Louis Adolphe Cochery minister of Post and Telegraph Office in France invited Sutton to membership of the Soci t Internationale des Electriciens.: 50 Sutton was also offered membership of Electrical societies from America, Belgium and Russia.: 50 In 1890 prior to leaving for England, a farewell dinner was held by the citizens of Ballarat, where Sutton was presented with an Illuminated address.: 84 8  London: 1890 1893 Sutton registered Sutton's Process Syndicate in November 1891 at an address in London to exploit his Suttontype printing process. The process was not considered particularly innovative and it was reported to be unreliable. He abandoned the business to return to Australia.In 1892, he was introduced to Nikola Tesla by Lord Rayleigh and William Preece.: ix On the return voyage to Australia in 1893, Sutton used his printing process to contribute pictures to a shipboard newspaper called the Red Sea Scorcher.  Melbourne Sutton travelled with Alexander Graham Bell from Melbourne to Ballarat on 15 August 1910 where they discussed their respective discoveries.: 225 6 Sutton died suddenly, at his residence , on 28 July 1912, at the age of 56 and was buried in the Brighton Cemetery.  Inventions   Printing  Sutton's Suttontype process for converting photographs into a printing surface was patented in 1887.  Wireless telegraphy  Sutton discovered, and patented, a galena detector : 134 that had superior performance over other devices used to that time.Sutton had also built the world's first portable radio: 222 and held a number of other patents relating to wireless transmission and reception.  Other endeavours   Aviation  Sutton built a clockwork driven ornithopter operating on a fixed arm: 11 and presented two papers on flight to the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, in 1878, entitled On the Flight of Birds and A rial Navigation and Second Paper on the Flight of Birds .  Batteries  In 1881, Sutton had developed a new rechargeable battery: 18 : 318 which was patented the following year.: 49, 281 He also wrote of a four volt cell compound battery invention which was described as impossible by the English Mechanic and World of Science in 1890.: 170  Lighting  Sutton demonstrated a light globe sixteen days after Edison's demonstration on 31 December 1879.: 38 : 316 Subsequently Sutton's vacuum pump design which overcame deficiencies in the Sprengel pump, was used for the production of light globes by the Edison Swan company.: 42 4 : 316 7  Telephony  After reading of Bell's 1876 announcement of the invention of the telephone, Sutton had designed about twenty different telephones within a year.: 316 Sutton was said to have believed in the free flow of information as a gift to science ... patented little, although sixteen of his twenty original telephone designs were patented by others overseas .The first Australian telephone connection was made in Ballarat and Ballarat East, linking fire stations in the two towns. The exact location of one of the telephone sets can be seen in the Ballarat East Fire Station. The device once allowed communication between the two fire brigades in Ballarat so that they could more accurately locate fires from their watch towers. Sutton had also wired up Sutton's Music Stores, his family business warehouses and offices, with a telephone network two years before an official Australian telephone system. Sutton devised a method for using gas and water pipes as part of a telephone circuit.  Microscopy  In 1885 after cholera outbreak on a ship in Queensland, Sutton obtained a slide and managed to photograph the cholera germ at 1000 times magnification. A letter to this effect, from Sutton, was published in The Argus on 28 December 1885.  Photography  In the 1880s Sutton also devised a colour photography process but, although examples of this work exist, he did not commercialize it.: 98 9, 103  Television  In 1885, Sutton designed, but did not construct, a mechanical television apparatus to see the Melbourne Cup in Ballarat.: 319 Sutton had published his Telephane designs in 1890. According to historian Ann Moyal, the concept was never successfully demonstrated: Sutton's 'TV system', which he called 'telephany', used all the latest technology, such as the recently invented Kerr effect, the Nipkow disc and the selenium photocell. But its weak link in the 1870s was that the signal had to be transferred by telegraph lines, as radio had yet to arrive, and these were too slow to transmit the dashing horses of the Melbourne Cup successfully.  Facsimile  Sutton used his telephone system to demonstrate facsimile transmission with the help of Nicola Tesla in England.: 188 9 An account of his invention was later published in Washington in 1896, noting that the first patents for long distance transmission of images dated back to 1867.  Lifts  For the benefit of his mother, who had been paralyzed by a stroke, a new hydraulic lift had been installed in the newly built Suttons Music Emporium.: 109 As Ballarat's low water pressure and lack of an efficient drainage system were incompatible, Sutton designed and built a new hydraulic mechanism to drive the lift. This design was subsequently used by the Austral Otis company and exported for use in America.: 110  Automotive  Henry Sutton can be classed as an automobile inventor and designer rather than a manufacturer whose achievements were considerable and internationally recognized. As an inventor he produced a number of automobiles of his own design in an evolutionary process . In 1897, a tricycle fitted with a Sutton designed and built engine was driven from Melbourne to Ballarat. Despite atrocious road conditions the trip was completed in eleven and a half hours, and the vehicle arrived in Ballarat to a crowd of thousands.: 129 32 From 1898 Sutton held patents for improvements in combustion engine carburettors; and, by 1899, he had built and driven the Sutton Autocar, one of the first motor cars in Australia.  Automobile Club of Victoria Sutton was a founding member of the Automobile Club of Victoria; and, at its inaugural meeting, on 10 December 1903, Sutton's proposed objects of the club were unanimously accepted by all present: that the objects of the club should be the promotion of a social organisation and club, composed mainly of persons owning self propelled vehicles or motor cycles; to afford a means of recording the experiences of members and others using motor cars and motor cycles; to promote investigation in their development; to co operate in securing rational legislation and the formation of proper rules and regulations governing the use of motor cars and motor cycles in cities, towns and country districts; to maintain the lawful rights and privileges and protect the interests of owners and users of all forms of self propelled vehicles whenever and wherever such interests, rights and privileges are menaced; to promote and encourage the improvement, construction and maintenance of roads and highways and the development generally in this State of motoring, and to maintain a club to be devoted to the interests and advancement of automobilism.  Legacy   Henry Sutton Circuit  On 20 January 2004, several streets in the new Canberra suburb of Dunlop were named after inventors, inventions, and artists ; and one of these new streets was called Henry Sutton Circuit .  The Henry Sutton Oration  In 2014, the Telecommunications Association , inaugurated its annual Henry Sutton Oration.  Poetry  Les Murray referred to Sutton and television in his 1990 poem The Tube .  The Science Show  Science journalist Robyn Williams has featured Sutton in episodes of his long running radio program.

            "text": "The National Electric Light Association was a national United States trade association that included the operators of electric central power generation stations, electrical supply companies, electrical engineers, scientists, educational institutions and interested individuals. Founded in 1885 by George S. Bowen, Franklin S. Terry and Charles A. Brown, it represented the interests of private companies involved in the fledgling electric power industry that included companies like General Electric, Westinghouse and most of the country's electric companies. The NELA played a dominant role in promoting the interests and expansion of the U.S. commercial electric industry. The association's conventions became a major clearinghouse for technical papers covering the entire field of electricity and its development, with a special focus on the components needed for centralized power stations or power plants. In 1895 the Association sponsored a conference that led to the issue of the first edition of the U.S. National Electrical Code. Its rapid growth mirrored the development of electricity in the U.S. that included regional and statewide affiliations across the country and Canada. It was the forerunner of the Edison Electric Institute . Its highly aggressive battle against municipal ownership of electric production led to extensive federal hearings between 1928 35 that led to its demise. Its logo is an early depiction of Ohm's law which is C equals E divided by R, or the current strength in any circuit is equal to the electromotive force divided by the resistance, or the basic law of electricity. It was established in 1827 by Dr. G. S. Ohm.  Structure During its first convention, the NELA set up a formal structure that included a constitution and a governing body made up of elected officers using committees to carry out the interests of its members. By 1904, the NELA had 588 members that were broken down into major classes. The membership included all of the major electric suppliers, like Edison Electric Company that later became General Electric as well as most of the larger electric generating companies from the east to west coast. The list of honorary members included Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild, Charles A. Coffin , George Westinghouse, Lord Kelvin, Charles F. Brush, Thomas A. Edison, Prof. Elihu Thomson, and Nikola Tesla. Tesla read his technical paper on Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena at the 1893 convention in St. Louis. By 1921, the NELA had eight different classes of membership with over 11,000 members including companies, associations and individuals from other countries. The NELA had nearly 30 different committees in place that came together during its conventions. These committees that included geographical representatives from the industry broken down by region and state affiliated associations and industry representatives coordinated the distribution of reports on best practices and standards of the industry from the ratings of light bulbs, safety, accounting practices, engineering designs of equipment to advertizing, public relations and legislative campaigns. Each year, the NELA selected a new president to lead the Association from an executive of a major electric power company. For example, in 1898 Sam Insull from the Commonwealth Edison Company was selected the same year that his hometown of Chicago hosted the June 7 9 event. The president would preside over the convention that included an introductory speech that summarized the major events of the year. Part of Insull's speech stunned attendees as he promoted the idea that electric companies were natural monopolies that should be regulated at the state rather than local level. Within fifteen years, his idea would sweep the nation. The Association maintained a modest year round staff in New York City. They managed the group's budget, produced and distributed its reports and coordinated the conventions along with the host electric company. Prior to 1905, events were three days long but jumped to five days by 1910. In 1907, the association introduced a monthly Bulletin that was distributed to all members. By 1910, the NELA was approaching 7,000 members, with its main office maintaining an exchange network of 114 trade and company journals being produced by its members in 1922. Each convention was organized to draw prominent media coverage. Exhibitions that included dazzling displays of lighting and the latest electric appliances were modeled after the wildly popular 1893 Chicago World's Fair. It was always held at a high profile luxury hotel. The convention's publicity included local and national celebrities. Opening ceremonies for the convention and exhibition included a welcome speech by the host city's mayor. Each day would have a morning and evening session that started with a live presentation of a major paper followed by a discussion on the topic by those in attendance. This was followed by entertainment, trips to the exhibition hall or local company's central electric power station.  History The National Electric Light Association's formation and activities parallel the history of the U.S. electric industry and early development of energy use via electricity and its role in lighting. Electric lighting started with the use of Arc lamps, soon followed by Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan's incandescent light bulb. Most indoor lighting prior to this was done by wood fireplaces, candles, Whale oil, or kerosene in buildings. While the invention of arc lamps for street lighting in larger urban areas date back to the beginning of the 19th century. The first Power stations used hydro electric power that evolved from watermills and centuries of mechanical development. Edison's Pearl Street Station was the first commercial steam powered central station where coal fed boilers were used to produce electricity by generators. On February 25, 1885, NELA held its first convention in Chicago Illinois with an estimated 90 people in attendance. Its first president was J. Frank Morrison. The founding meeting was organized by George S. Bowen, Franklin S. Terry, and Charles A. Brown. Franklin S. Terry was known for having organized a number of local and then regional Incandescent light bulb companies that included the National Electric Lamp Company that was merged with General Electric in 1911. Charles Brown was the head of the Western Electric Company, an electrical engineering and manufacturing company that served as the primary supplier to AT T and the Bell Operating Companies. George Bowen was the founder of the Elgin Electric Light Company of Elgin Illinois and the head of the Chicago Pacific railway company.From its founding, until 1891, the NELA held semi annual conventions, when it switched to annual events that were hosted by various cities across the United States. These conventions had a number of major goals that included formal presentations by scientists and engineers on the subjects of municipal street lights, residential lights, appliances, central power station construction and operations. The conventions also included major exhibitions of the latest appliances, motors, and equipment being produced by electric supply companies. In addition, the convention was meant to help newly formed electric generating companies discuss the latest innovations in the transmission of electricity. The conventions with its lighting exhibitions quickly became a major promotional tool for the electric industry that NELA would soon represent as membership expanded nationwide over the next few years. The turnout from around the country for the first convention convinced the attendees that this should become a regular event as a constitution was set up along with committees to coordinate future conventions. The second convention was August 18 19, 1885 in New York City. At this convention discussions were held about how to run a central power station, what kinds of members could join and debates between Electric arc vs. incandescent lighting. It was reported that roughly 350,000 arc and incandescent lights were already in operation around the country by 1886. The NELA's earliest public relations concern was with Insurance Companies as a result of Edison's public demonstrations known as the war of the currents. Its conventions were already starting to include exhibitions by supply companies. A number of committees were set up to deal with a broad variety of issues that were rapidly evolving at this early date of the industry's development with a strong focus on statistics, both as internal feedback for the industry but also for promotion. By the third convention at Baltimore, finding a space big enough for all the exhibitors became a problem. The 1887 convention at Philadelphia was the first year the NELA took up the issue of Alternating current as a possible source of long distance transmission and power, while the number of delegates jumped to 344 with its summer convention at Boston. Topics from how to insulate wires to storage batteries and motors were just beginning to be discussed. By 1888, one of the major issues was whether put all electrical wiring underground as was the demand in New York City and the growing problem of competing electric company lines on a single electric pole. During their 1889 convention in Chicago, the NELA statistics bureau pointed out that there were now 2.7 million arc and incandescent lights in the country or nearly a tenfold increase in three years. By 1892 the NELA had 26 Honorary members, 90 active members and 111 associate members in the association.Between 1900 and 1902 the NELA conventions included 16 papers, 4 reports and their first discussions about appliances, standardized accounting practices and consumer complaints. In 1903, however, the number of published papers and reports started to skyrocket with 14 papers and 5 reports that were published in two volumes with major pieces on corporate consolidation and the promotion of electric signs. This grew again in 1904 with 16 papers, 18 reports 3 discussions and 3 additional special reports with the convention expanding to a week long event. The highlights included presentations on legislation, long distance transmission, electric heating, advertising methods and remote control of appliances. 1905 had 16 papers and 16 reports with more discussions on advertising and networking with alliances as well as a separate report on municipal ownership that was not released as well as the introduction to the idea of co operation within the industry to organize and promote its agenda across a broad array of issues.  Electric Industry Co operation 1890 1905  NELA's conventions played a prominent role in bringing manufacturers, engineers and central station companies together to share information about issues the newly emerging industry faced. The three day conventions would include around five technical papers and debates on lighting, motors, circuits and central station hardware that included the popular exhibits of equipment being produced. During this early period, there were no appliances being produced. In one of its most important early contributions between 1890 and 1897, the NELA led a campaign that brought seven other national associations together, including the Underwriters National Electric Association, known today as the National Fire Protection Association, along with the insurance industry to produce the National Electrical Code.In 1893, NELA's St. Louis convention had its first paper on Alternating Current, a presentation by Nikola Tesla that drew a large crowd and the morals of corporations. The presentation on Corporate Morals was NELA's first paper mentioning the tension between private vs. public ownership of electric generating facilities. At the time, all but the very wealthiest members of the country could afford electric lighting while the only other market was for street lighting. A.E. Armstrong started his presentation on corporate morals with a joke about how a preacher told him that the first corporation of which mention is ever made, and it is in the Bible, brought death and misery into the world, and that same history has ever repeated itself. He then acknowledged that he couldn't kill the preacher, but reassured him that his business wasn't actually a corporation, just a partnership. During his presentation, he spoke of moral obligations required by both the public and corporations, but also about tactics against the cooperative movement that distrusted corporations and how easily a few organized men can disperse mobs. NELA's president then stated that the industry had failed to understand or promote the importance of Corporate personhood to the public. From 1894 until the end of the century, 42 formal papers and five lectures were presented at NELA conventions on technical subjects from Lightning arresters, meter rates, lighting large cities to electrical safety issues. In 1896, a few special topics stuck out like a lecture on Roentgen Rays, electrolysis and standardized electric sockets. Besides the usual business of the conventions which was handled by committee, the Association's 1898 president, Samuel Insull introduced the heretical idea of Europe's public regulation of electric companies as a way to legitimize the industry's promotion of its natural monopoly business model.Between 1900 and 1902 the NELA conventions included 16 papers, 4 reports and their first discussions about appliances, standardized accounting practices and consumer complaints. In 1903, however, the number of published papers and reports started to skyrocket with 14 papers and 5 reports that were published in two volumes with major pieces on corporate consolidation and the promotion of electric signs. This grew again in 1904 with 16 papers, 18 reports 3 discussions and 3 additional special reports with the convention expanding to a week long event. The highlights included presentations on legislation, long distance transmission, electric heating, advertising methods and remote control of appliances. 1905 had 16 papers and 16 reports with more discussions on advertising and networking with alliances as well as an separate report on municipal ownership that was not released as well as the introduction to the idea of co operation within the industry to organize and promote its agenda across a broad array of issues.  Electric Industry Co operation Campaign 1905 07  In February 1905, the light bulb industry's National Electric Lamp Association financed the formation of the Co operative Electrical Development Association with the goal of making it the coordinator of a public relations campaign for the entire electric industry. In June 1905, J.R. Crouch, a prominent leader of the lamp industry took the proposal to the National Electric Light Association's convention in Denver Colorado. After investigating the proposal for a year, NELA agreed to a three year test period that set aside .02 of the industry's national income for the Co operative plan with Crouse in charge.On March 23, 1906, 65 representatives from major east coast electric companies met to hear Crouse's latest presentation on the Co operation campaign that had been given a 60,000 budget to proceed for 3 years. Crouse made a 45 page presentation that included 10 papers on major aspects of the plan by the acting president of NELA, General Electric, Westinghouse, Western Electric and other segments of the industry as a whole. NELA then created a new Commercial Section committee with a budget of 30,000 for the Co operative Electrical Development Association's office in New York City. The next step was to have Crouse announce details of the project at the June 1906 NELA Convention.Crouse's presentation at the NELA convention for the Co operative Electrical Development Association's goal to promote a dramatic expansion in the consumption of electricity by coordinating a nationwide public relations campaign aimed at the American public was the first step. He then laid out the major parts of the plan: The distribution of 26 pamphlets on best practices that would eventually go into the formation of a national handbook; The formation of a national quarterly magazine the NELA Bulletin that started production in 1907; The formation of central station commercial departments that integrate their work with national advertising agencies; A nationwide news clipping and Press Bureau to monitor public opinion and distribute PR pieces to the national media; Coordinated advertising campaigns between trade journals, appliance wholesalers, manufacturers and electric companies; Establishment of a statistics department to distribute and promote industry growth and projected goals; Networking with other trades, the country's magazine industry and the Chamber of Commerce; Networking with the architectural and engineering communities on electrical designs in new and old buildings.The movement's slogan would be: All Together, All the Time, for Everything Electrical. As part of the plan, one of NELA's largest ongoing campaigns against Municipal ownership which had its own committee was renamed to the Committee on Public Policy during the convention. In 1907 J.R Crouse became seriously ill so the industry partially shelved the larger project, not just because of him but due to the dramatic changes taking place nationwide The change in how the industry would be regulated.  The electric power industry gets regulated 1907  Prior to 1907, city governments across the country were in charge of electric company's licenses and setting rates. The country's central stations were tiny compared to modern electric power companies, with larger cities having a number of competing companies. This politicized situation led to major scandals from New York to San Francisco. One public reaction to this was the growing number of cities like San Francisco, Cleveland and Seattle that built their own power stations. The other response was regulation reform which was first proposed by Samuel Insull in 1898 at NELA's convention. His proposal was to shift regulatory control from the city to the state in exchange for monopoly control over service territories. In 1905, the National Civic Federation did a two year investigation of municipal vs. private electric stations. They ended up promoting Insull's plan which he'd gotten from Europe. In 1907, model legislation giving regulatory control of all public utilities to the state was adopted by Wisconsin, New York and Massachusetts. It quickly spread nationwide.  Electric Industry Co operation Campaign 1912  In September 1912 industry leaders met at the NELA's Association Island and agreed to restart J.R. Crouse's national public relations campaign as laid out in 1906. The new organization, known as the Society for Electrical Development Inc., with an initial budget of 150,000 had its first meeting on October 12 at the offices of the National Electric Light Association. A committee led by H.L. Doherty from the Association Island meeting setup its bylaws including the twenty board of governors placed in charge that were selected from across the entire electrical industry. In September 1913, a second meeting chaired by NELA's president J.B. McCall known as Camp Co operation was held. Attendees included the head of National City Bank, General Electric, Westinghouse, Western Electric, Senators, academics, patent lawyers and state regulatory commissioners. Even Thomas Edison sent a letter in support. The four day retreat's informal settings were similar to the Bohemian Club. Twenty prominent speakers from the industry and government spoke including Samuel Insull and J.R. Crouse. Details of the event were published and circulated to NELA members nationwide. There were four Camp Co operation meetings held at Association Island between 1912 and 1920. The Society held a competition that ended on May 5, 1913 for the best slogan and logo with the winner being Do It Electrically . James Wakemen was made the manager of the Society with Henry L Doherty president. By June 1913 the Society had 180 members with and 125,000 pledged. During the June NELA convention an example from Cleveland known as the People's Electrical Page with a full page of advertisements and publicity pieces three times a week by local companies was demonstrated as a new model for coordinating newspaper content. The ad campaigns for residential and commercial clients included 25 rotating subjects during the year ending with Christmas. By 1917, the Society's annual Christmas campaign that started on November 29 sent its 1,300 members 450,000 pieces of material with their annual Electrical Prosperity Week. One of the most popular items were stamps as well as colorful window posters and movies.The 38th annual NELA convention was held between June 7 and 11, 1915 in San Francisco at the same time as the Panama Pacific International Exposition. By 1915, the NELA had 29 standing committees made up of 500 working members that produced 2,500 pages of reports and 17 technical papers. Besides the regular convention where the papers and reports were shared, many other events took place, including daily ceremonies at the Expo with special light shows, parades, tours, and evening balls. A specially lit electric temple was erected in downtown Union Square, while addresses by industry leaders, regulators and politicians covering a wide variety of topics including the state of the west coast's massive hydro electric development. One of the four major NELA sections on accounting practices demonstrated the latest technique of punched cards and accounting machines to handle large numbers of ratepayers, another section demonstrated the latest electric cars, while an entirely new section was opened up to begin active relationships with technical colleges and institutions nationwide. Reports claimed that NELA's total membership at over 13,000 by the time of the convention with its public relations section being increasingly important.  Goodwin Plan California Electric Co operation Campaign  During World War I, William L. Goodwin conceived of the California Electric Co operation campaign to coordinate appliance sales between major segments of the electric industry. The campaign spread across California, Australia and then to the rest of the U.S. via the industry's trade journals. The model was first devised in Fresno California using Hoover vacuum cleaners but was used for other appliances as well. The plan started with local newspaper advertisements developed by the manufacturer for use by the electric company. The manufacturer would then also work with the local wholesaler of the product to make sure supplies were in place when the campaign began. Trained door to door salesmen driving company cars with logos of the product used the electric company's database so the peddlers knew the names of the customers when they knocked on their door. The last part of the deal was to sell the appliance on credit. Five dollars down and it's yours for monthly payments. The strategy increased appliance sales five times higher than appliance stores and resulted in increased electric use for the utility company.  1925 San Francisco Convention  NELA's 1925 annual convention was held between June 16 and 19 in San Francisco California. Besides being two weeks later than usual, it just happened to coincide with the San Francisco Board of Supervisors vote the day after the convention that gave away 30 years of work by the city to build its own municipal power facility. On May 26, 1898, after years of political struggle, San Francisco passed a new city charter calling for the public ownership of all utility services. It was in need of a new water supply and the replacement of the corrupt Spring Valley Water Company. The city identified a candidate site in Yosemite National Park for the construction of a new water and power supply known as Hetch Hetchy. It would take years of fighting the water company, private interests and John Muir before the dust settled and construction began in 1914. By the spring of 1925, the dam was complete, the city's new water supply was almost done and power lines had been strung within a mile of a newly constructed Pacific Gas Electric Company substation, when the mayor lied about the city running out of wire. With 4,000 electric company executives from across the U.S. in town, the conservative San Francisco Chronicle filled its front pages with speeches touting the benefits of private ownership of electricity. On June 20, openly defying the 1913 federal Raker Act that banned private sale of Hetch Hetchy power, the Board of Supervisors voted to lease all power from the facility to the Pacific Gas Electric Company. Attempts to reverse the contract, including a 1940 U.S. Supreme Court decision, and decades of political campaigns have failed to break the agreement.  Federal Trade Commission Investigation  According to the March 21st, 1927 New York Herald Tribune, Power Trust opponents met on March 11 in the Washington D.C. office of Nebraska's Republican Senator George W. Norris. Norris, along with former Pennsylvania governor Gifford Pinchot, U.S. senators, house members, leaders of radical organizations and movements came together to plan a government ownership drive. In reality, the group was developing plans for a senate investigation of the electric industry. In June, just as the Federal Trade Commission's report on the country's most controversial electric holding company, the Electric Bond and Share Company was released, Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh introduced a resolution calling for a Senate investigation of the country's electric utilities. The reasons for Senator Walsh's investigation was clear: General Electric's central role in the 1925 global Phoebus cartel's planned obsolescence of light bulbs The 1926 U.S. Dept. of Justice light bulb price fixing lawsuit GE's ownership of over 10 of the country's electric utilities via its Electric Bond and Share Company GE's leading role with NELA in the long standing war against municipal ownership of electric stations State attempts to regulate holding company abuses had failed while over 95 of America's 6.5 million farmers and most of the country's urban poor had no access to electricityWalsh's initial legislation failed but the coalition did not give up. He reintroduced his resolution on December 17, 1927 that received positive support from newspapers around the country. The electric industry was initially opposed to any investigation but then reversed its strategy, using its senate allies to amend the resolution, transferring the investigation to the Federal Trade Commission. On February 15, 1928 the Walsh resolution, or Senate Resolution 83 passed with the requirement for public hearings. It directed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the U.S. electric industry and make monthly written status reports to the Senate on the following: The capital assets and liabilities of gas and electric holding companies or any of its subsidiaries doing interstate or international business; all financial activities surrounding the above mentioned corporation's securities or stocks; all connections between stockholders, holding companies and subsidiaries; all services, earnings, and expenses between holding companies and its subsidiaries; and the value or detriment to the public of holding companies and any proposed corrective legislation.And The utility industry and its association's effort to manipulate opinion of public ownership of electrical generation; and since 1923, any attempt to influence the outcome of federal elections.The Commission's public hearings started on March 8, 1928 and ended on December 12, 1935, spanning three different presidential administrations. The investigation was overseen by the Federal Trade Commission's Chief Counsel Robert E. Healy and Commissioner Edgar A. McCulloch . It was one of the largest federal investigations ever undertaken with a starting budget of 85,000 that increased to over 1 million annually. The seven year investigation produced 63,000 pages of testimony and 6,000 exhibits in 94 volumes. The Commission sent out dozens of accountants to all 48 states to inspect the financial records of 29 holding companies, 70 sub holding companies and 278 gas electric companies with assets of over 19 billion. In addition to the monthly reports, the Commission also produced annual summaries of the probe. The 94 volumes are broken down as follows: Volumes 1 19 March 1928 Jan. 1930: the National Electric Light Assoc., committee members, and affiliated company activities. Volumes 20 80 Feb. 1930 Sept. 1935: investigations of specific electric companies. Volumes 81 84 A D Oct. Dec. 1935: the Natural Gas Industry investigation, conclusions and recommendations. Volumes containing Exhibits Numbers 1 4047. Volumes 69 A through 81 A Sept. 1934 Dec. 1935: seven special reports including the FTC's conclusions and Recommendations. Volume 69 A 9 15 1934: Pros and cons of federal ownership Volume 71 A 11 15 1934: Propaganda Part I: Efforts by Associations and Agencies of Electric and Gas Utilities to Influence Public Opinion Volume 71 B 11 15 1934: Propaganda Part II: Index of names and exhibits Vol 1 20 Volume 72 A 6 17 1935: Financial Investigation Phase of Holding Companies Volume 73 A 1 28 1935: Conclusions and Recommendations for governing holding Companies Volume 77 A 5 16 1935: Propaganda Index for testimony exhibits Vol. 21 45 Volume 81 A 11 14 1935: Propaganda Part III Efforts by Electric and Gas Utilities to Influence Public OpinionThe Federal Trade Commission's final conclusions called the electric utility industry's practices evil and recommended that holding companies working across state lines be broken up. The industry's decades old propaganda campaign which was led by NELA and the very largest holding companies actively worked to undermine public ownership of power stations, using every conceivable strategy and medium. The report states that the record establishes that, measured by quantity, extent, and cost, this was probably the greatest peace time propaganda campaign ever conducted by private interests in this country. The NELA's handbook was used to train thousands of industry proponents of private ownership. Its tactics included fear based red baiting attacks that were deployed using every possible medium. The campaign included both free and paid for advertising in the hundreds of thousands of pieces costing ten's of millions of dollars annually, and in most cases paid for out of the ratepayers pocket. Millions more were spent to influence government officials and elections. From ownership of newspapers, and radio stations, all the way to editorial control over the nation's textbooks, the industry promoted itself while leaving no stone unturned in its brutal attack against the country's municipally owned power stations. Once the investigation was underway, most of the country's newspapers went silent on the investigation. On May 5, 1928 Senator George Norris attacked the press for failing to cover the dramatic issues being exposed during the public hearings. One major controversy was the industry's veto power over what was allowed in the country's school text books. As a result, the National Education Association denounced this activity.One of the largest parts of the investigation focused on the industry's decades old propaganda war hidden behind their deceptive co operation campaign . The multiple volumes and thousands of pages of exhibits and testimony on the subject was summarized by Jack Levin in one of the few books to have ever been written about the results of the FTC's investigation. In Chapter twelve, he detailed how NELA's national network of Public Utility Information Committees stigmatized the democrats, republicans and cities supporting public power as un American, resulting in the country's media freely giving away ten's of thousands of stories mixed in with the 30 million a year advertising budget of the industry. The investigation concluded on the last day of 1935. According to the FTC, the investigation resulted in the enactment of such remedial legislation as the Securities Act of 1933, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act of 1935, and the Natural Gas Act of 1938. The Investigation resulted in 94 volumes of reports up to 2,000 pages in length, with its last report issued in 1936. On March 12, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt released a report based on the Federal Trade Commission investigation he commissioned by the National Power Policy Committee. This report became the template for the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  Closure  On April 4, 1932, three major utility groups rejoined NELA after its executive director Paul Clapp resigned. Clapp was associated with Samuel Insull, who was a past president of NELA and one of its most powerful leaders. Four days later, Insull's massive Middle West Utility empire failed to obtain a critical loan from National City Bank. On April 16, Middle West which was made up of 24 holding companies and 239 operating companies, covering 30 U.S. states went into receivership. Two months later, Insull fled to Europe after resigning his chairmanship of Middle West 13 . Its bankruptcy was the largest electric company failure in U.S. history until the 2001 collapse of Enron. During NELA's June 1932 convention, a committee was formed to investigate the potential of merging with the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies. NELA was dissolved on February 15, 1933, at the end of its 56th convention in New York City. However, on January 12, 1933 the Edison Electric Institute was formed to take over as the association representing the U.S. electric industry .

            "text": "Teleoperation indicates operation of a system or machine at a distance. It is similar in meaning to the phrase remote control but is usually encountered in research, academia and technology. It is most commonly associated with robotics and mobile robots but can be applied to a whole range of circumstances in which a device or machine is operated by a person from a distance. The term teleoperation is in use in research and technical communities as a standard term for referring to operation at a distance. This is as opposed to telepresence which is a less standard term and might refer to a whole range of existence or interaction that include a remote connotation.  History The 19th century saw many inventors working on remotely operated weapons including prototypes built by John Louis Lay , John Ericsson , Victor von Scheliha , and the first practical wire guided torpedo, the Brennan torpedo, patented by Louis Brennan in 1877. In 1898, Nikola Tesla demonstrated a remotely controlled boat with a patented wireless radio guidance system that he tried to market to the United States military, but was turned down.Teleoperation is now moving into the hobby industry with first person view equipment. FPV equipment mounted on hobby cars, planes and helicopters give a TV style transmission back to the operator, extending the range of the vehicle to greater than line of sight range.  Examples There are several particular types of systems that are often controlled remotely: Entertainment systems are often controlled remotely via a remote control. Industrial machinery is often operated remotely, particularly in hazardous environments. Examples include the construction of the Object Shelter or sarcophagus at Chernobyl after the Chernobyl accident, and removal of debris after hazardous rock slides. Remotely operated vehicles are extensively used in hazardous environments . Remote surgery Unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as drones  Teleoperation of Autonomous Vehicles Teleoperation of Autonomous Vehicles, is the ability to remotely drive or assist a self driving car. Most leading companies in the industry believe that to bridge the gap between current self driving capabilities and the requirements needed for widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, there is a need to have Teleoperation capabilities for assisting self driving cars, in situations of edge cases where the autonomous vehicle software stack has low confidence level in its ability to perform the correct action, or when the vehicle needs to operate outside of its standard operating parameters. Without remote assistance, in such situations the self driving car would transition to a Minimum Risk Maneuverer which is usually to stop. Many AV companies plan on using teleoperations as part of their rollout for self driving cars. Examples of companies that have stated they will deploy, or currently deploying teleoperations solutions include Voyage.auto, Denso, Waymo, GM Cruise, Aptiv, Zoox. Teleoperation of Autonomous Vehicles includes privately owned self driving car use cases, such as self parking assistants, shared mobility use cases, e.g. in robotaxis and autonomous shuttles and industrial use cases, for example autonomous forklifts. There are two main modes for Teleoperation of Autonomous Vehicles: Remote Driving, also called Direct Driving where the remote operator performs the dynamic drive task, i.e. drives the car remotely, controlling the car's steering, acceleration and braking systems. Remote Assistance, also called High Level Commands remote operators supervise the vehicle, and provide instructions, approve or correct the vehicle path, without actually performing the dynamic driving task. Some companies deploy a combination of both concepts, depending on the use case. Examples of companies that provide solutions in the field of Teleoperations are DriveU.auto, Roboauto, Scotti.ai, Phantom.Auto, Pylot, Ottopia, and Designated Driver.

            "text": "The Exposition Universelle of 1889 was a world's fair held in Paris, France, from 5 May to 31 October 1889. It was the fourth of eight expositions held in the city between 1855 and 1937. It attracted more than thirty two million visitors. The most famous structure created for the Exposition, and still remaining, is the Eiffel Tower.  Organization The Exposition was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille, which marked the beginning of French Revolution, and was also seen as a way to stimulate the economy and pull France out of an economic recession. The Exposition attracted 61,722 official exhibitors, of whom twenty five thousand were from outside of France.  Admission price Admission to the Exposition cost forty centimes, at a time when the price of an economy plate of meat and vegetables in a Paris cafe was ten centimes. Visitors paid an additional price for several of the Exposition's most popular attractions. Climbing the Eiffel Tower cost five Francs; admission to the popular panoramas, theatres and concerts was one franc. Visitors from the French provinces could buy a ticket which included the train fare and entry into the Exposition. The total cost of Exposition was 41,500,000 francs, while income was 49,500,000 francs. It was the last of the Paris Universal Expositions to make a profit.  National participation and boycotts The countries that officially participated in the Exposition were Andorra, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, the United States, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii, Honduras, India, Japan, Morocco, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Norway, Paraguay, Persia, Saint Martin, El Salvador, Serbia, Siam, the South African Republic, Switzerland, Uruguay and Venezuela. The British dominions of New Zealand and Tasmania also took part. Because of the theme of the Exposition, celebrating the overthrow of the French monarchy, nearly all European countries with monarchies officially boycotted the Exposition. The boycotting nations were Germany, Austria Hungary, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, and Sweden.Nonetheless, many citizens and companies from those countries participated, and a number of countries had their participation entirely funded by private sponsors. They included Germany and Alsace Lorraine, Austria Hungary, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, the United Kingdom and its colonies, Haiti, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Finland and Sweden.  Exposition sites  The Exposition occupied two large sites. The main site was on Champs de Mars on the Left Bank, which had been the parade ground of the Ecole Militaire, and had been occupied by the 1878 Universal Exposition. This was the site of the major part of the Exposition, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Machines, and the Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The Exposition extended across the Seine to the right bank, to the Trocadero Palace, which had been built on the heights for the 1878 Exposition. The slope from the Trocadero Palace down to the Seine was filled with terrace, fountains, gardens and horticultural exhibits. A separate, smaller site was located on the esplanade of Les Invalides, which hosted the pavilions of the French colonies. This section featured a large assortment of outdoor restaurants and cafes with foods from Indochina, North Africa, and other cuisines from around the world. The colonial pavilions conveyed the multiculturalism of France's colonies, the largest of them being the Palais Central des Colonies, designed by Stephen Sauvestre, who notably contributed to the design of the Eiffel Tower. In addition to the architectural displays of France's colonies, the exposition showcased a construction of villages inhabited by natives of the colonies, to be observed by viewers. The colonized people had their daily lives displayed for the exposition visitors, which made some of them uncomfortable. Samba Lawb Thiam, a jeweler from Senegal who was part of the 1889 exposition, said the following: We are very humiliated to be exhibited this way, in huts like savages; these straw and mud huts do not give an idea of Senegal. In Senegal ... we have large buildings, railroad stations, railroads; we light them with electricity. The Bureau of Hygiene does not tolerate the construction of this type of hovel. Those existing ones that fall into disrepair are not replaced. The incorporation of indigenous colonized individuals in the exposition was intended to be an educational element, but has also historically been framed as an exploitative and patronizing display of colonized people without their consent.This colonial section of the exposition was linked to the Champs de Mars site by a corridor of pavilions along the left Bank. This corridor, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, also featured a display called The History of Human Habitation , with model houses depicting the history of domestic architecture, designed with much imagination by Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Opera. There were twenty two different entrances to the Exposition, around its perimeter. They were open from 8 a.m. until 6:00 p,m. for the major exhibits and palaces, and until 11:00 in the evening for the illuminated greens and restaurants. The major ceremonial entrance was located at Les Invalides consisting of two tall pylons with colorful ornament, like giant candelabras.  Views of the Exposition       Structures   The Eiffel Tower  The Eiffel Tower, built especially for the Exposition, was the tallest structure in the world at the time. A competition to build what was simply called A tower of three hundred meters with a base one hundred meters wide, was announced in 1886. It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty. The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions. The structural design was created by two Eiffel engineers, Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, who along with Eiffel himself, received the patent for the plan. An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance. Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the Exposition was completed. The construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois Perret, a Paris suburb. Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son in law of Eiffel, declared, no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history. During the Exposition, no one other than construction personnel were allowed higher than the second viewing platform.In the first week of the Exposition, 29,922 persons climbed the tower to the viewing platform, though the elevators were not yet in service, and they had to climb by a narrow winding stairway. By the time the Exposition finished, after 173 days, 1,968,287 persons had ascended the tower. When the Exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station. In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level. In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.      The Gallery of Machines  A second monumental building on the site was the Galerie des machines, by the architect Ferdinand Dutert and engineer Victor Contamin, which had originally been built for the Universal Exposition of 1878. It was a huge iron and glass structure which contained the industrial displays. It occupied the entire width of the Exposition site, the land between the avenue de la Bourdonnais and the present avenue de Suffren, and covered 77,000 square meters, with 34,700 square meters of glass windows. At 111 meters, the Gallery covered the longest interior space in the world at the time, It cost 7,430,000 Francs, or seven times the cost of the Eiffel Tower. It was later used again at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 and then destroyed in 1910. The Gallery of Machines used a system of hinged arches made of steel or iron. Although often described as being constructed of steel, it was actually made of iron.   Science and technology  One important goal of the Exposition was to present the latest in science and technology. Thomas Edison visited the Exposition to visit a pavilion devoted to his recent inventions, including an improved phonograph with clearer sound quality. Another new technology that was promoted at the Exposition was the safety elevator, developed by a new American company, Otis Elevator. Otis built the elevators carrying passengers up the legs of the Eiffel Tower to the first level. When journalists expressed concern about the safety of the elevators, Otis technicians filled one elevator with three thousand kilograms of lead, simulating passengers, and then, with journalists from around the world watching, cut the cable with an axe. The elevator's fall was halted ten feet above the ground by the Otis safety brakes. There were pavilions especially devoted to the telephone and to electricity, and others devoted to maritime navigation, and another, the Palais de Guerre or Palace of War, to developments in military technology, such as naval artillery. Prefabricated metal housing was another technology that appeared at the Exposition. Gustave Eiffel developed a series of houses with roof and walls of galvanised steel, and wooden interiors, which could be rapidly put together or taken apart, largely for use in French colony of Indochina. Some of them served as ticket booths at the 1889 Exposition; one of these old booths, now used as a shelter for hikers, can now be found in the Forest of Dampierre.      The Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts  Other major buildings included the Palaces of Liberal and Fine Arts, each with a richly decorated dome, facing each other across a garden and reflecting pool between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. Both were designed by Jean Camille Formig with a similar plan. Both buildings had modern iron frames abundance of glass, but were completely covered with colorful ceramic tiles and sculpted decoration. The Exposition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine Egyptian Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Sch lcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Sch lcher had donated to the island. Today, it houses over 250,000 books and an ethnographic museum, and stands as a tribute to the man it is named after who led the movement to abolish slavery in Martinique.     Fountains  The Exposition featured numerous fountains and reflecting pools, particularly in the mall that ran between the Eiffel Tower and the Palace of Machines. The largest fountain, near the Eiffel Tower, was entitled The City of Paris enlightens the world with its torch. The fountain was designed by Jean Camille Formig , who designed the nearby Palaces of Fine Arts and Liberal Arts. The other major fountain, not far away, was The Five Parts of the World , illustrating the continents. It was designed by Francis de Saint Vidal.  The Street of Cairo and exotic habitations  The Rue de Caire was a popular attraction designed to recreate the architecture and street life of Cairo. It provided a striking contrast to the very modern Palace of Machines, next to it. It was the idea of Baron Delort Gl on, an art collector and specialist in Egyptian art, with financial support from Charles De Lesseps, the head of the Egyptian committee for the Exposition, and son of Ferdinand De Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal. It was a winding street, with buildings at odd angles, and featured, among other buildings, a minaret, two mosques, a school and two ornamental gateways. The doors, windows, and architectural fittings and decoration were real, imported from demolished buildings in Cairo. The street was populated by real Egyptians in costumes, including musicians, belly dancers, artists, craftsmen, and vendors of various Egyptian foods and delicacies. The Exposition featured several other examples of picturesque habitations and villages from around the world, including a Javanese village and recreated houses of villages from Senegal, Benin, and other colonies, with costumed residents.      The Pavilions of the participating nations and special industries  The Pavilions of the participating nations were located along the edge of the Champ de Mars. The Latin American nations had particularly colorful and lavish structures. The Pavilion of Argentina was one of the largest and most decorative pavilions in the Exposition. It was designed by the French architect Albert Ballu, who won the 1887 design competition. It covered 1,600 square meters, and was fifty meters high, topped by five iron and glass cupolas and surrounded by a frieze of mosaics, ceramics and coloured glass ornaments. After the Exposition closed, it was taken apart and shipped to Buenos Aires, where it stood until it was dismantled in 1952.In addition to the nations, there were pavilions of specialized industries, such as the Suez Canal company, the pavilion of the Transatlantic steamship company, the telephone and electricity pavilions, and the Pavilions of gas and oil. The Palace of Food Products was a very large and ornate structure, presenting French food and wine products. One of its highlights was an enormous sculpted wooden barrel from Champagne Mercier that could hold 200,000 bottles of champagne.           Charles Garnier's History of Habitation  An unusual display was the History of Habitation , designed by Charles Garnier, the architect of the Paris Opera House named for him. He was then 61 and had designed very few other major projects since the Opera. Although he had also signed a petition, along with other prominent writers and artists, that denounced the Eiffel Tower as an atrocity, he agreed to design a series of houses to illustrate the history of human habitation. The houses, separated by gardens, were placed close to the Eiffel Tower on a narrow strip of land along Quai D'Orsay and the banks of the Seine.The houses were arranged by century and by continent, beginning with Garnier's idea of prehistoric dwellings and huts, through the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans and other early civilizations, through the Middle Ages and Renaissance to the modern then houses from Japan, and China and the homes of Eskimos, and dwellings from Africa, Japan, China and Lapland, and dwellings of Native Americans, Aztecs and Incas. The dwellings were designed by Garnier with more imagination than strict historical accuracy, but they were picturesque and very popular. The Roman House had a special function, as the residence of the President of France when he visited the Exposition.    Other buildings  Many smaller but picturesque buildings were included within or adjacent to the Exposition. The architect Hector Guimard, then just twenty two years old, built his first two buildings for the Exposition; The cafe restaurant Au Grand Neptune at 148 Quai Louis Bleriot , and a small Pavillon of Electricity for an electrician named Ferdinand de Boy res, located just outside the Exposition site at avenue de Suffren. The Pavilion of electricity was demolished immediately after the Exposition, and the cafe was torn down in 1910. the exhibition will be famous for four distinctive features. In the first place, for its buildings, especially the Eiffel tower and the Machinery Hall; in the second place, for its Colonial Exhibition, which for the first time brings vividly to the appreciation of the Frenchmen that they are masters of lands beyond the sea; thirdly, it will be remembered for its great collection of war material, the most absorbing subject now a days, unfortunately, to governments if not to individuals; and fourthly, it will be remembered, and with good cause by many, for the extraordinary manner in which South American countries are represented.  Music and entertainment The Exposition itself included several large theatres for concerts and spectacles, including one for the dancers of Les Follies Parisiens. A separate theatre presented the music and dance of the French colonies in Indochina. Operas and concerts were also given in the grand hall of the Trocadero Palace. The Op ra Comique premiered on 14 May 1889 with a work specially composed for that event: Jules Massenet's Esclarmonde . The Barnum and Bailey Circus performed during the Exposition in the Salle des Fetes of the Palais des Machines. At the Exposition, the French composer Claude Debussy first heard Javanese gamelan music, performed by an ensemble from Java. This influenced some of his later compositions.Outside the Exposition, other theatres and venues presented a range of spectacles including Buffalo Bill Cody and his Wild West Show, with the sharpshooter Annie Oakley.   Transportation the miniature train Transport around the Exposition was partly provided by the 3 kilometre 600 mm gauge Decauville railway at Exposition Universelle. The Exposition railroad was reported to have carried 6,342,446 visitors in just six months of operation. Some of the locomotives used on this line later saw service on the Chemins de fer du Calvados and the Di go Suarez Decauville railway.  Notable visitors and special events Celebrities and dignitaries from around the world visited the Exposition. Thomas Edison, with his wife and daughter, visited the Exposition on August 14, 1889, his third day in France, to visit the exhibit where his improved phonograph was being demonstrated. He also ascended to the viewing platform of the Eiffel Tower, where he was met by a group of Sioux Indians who were at the Exposition to perform in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He returned to the Eiffel Tower later in his visit , where he was hosted for a lunch in Eiffel's private apartment on the Tower, along with the composer Charles Gounod. A Negro village where 400 people were displayed was a popular attraction.Other prominent visitors included the Shah of Persia Nasereddin Shah, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Alexandra; artists Antoni Gaudi, James McNeill Whistler, Edvard Munch, Rosa Bonheur and Paul Gauguin; U.S. journalist and diplomat Whitelaw Reid; author Henry James; Filipino patriots Jos Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar; and inventors Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. A central attraction in the French section was the Imperial Diamond, at the time the largest diamond in the world.The Mexican pavilion featured a model of an exotic Aztec temple, a combination of archeology, history, architecture, and technology. The presentation of Joseph Farcot's steam engine, that had already won a prize in 1878.  Statistics Expenses: 41,500,000 Francs Receipts: 49,500,000 Francs Visitors: 32,250,297 Exhibitors: over 61,722, of whom 55 were French Countries represented: 35  Legacy Most of the buildings were on military land or city owned park land, and they were demolished shortly after the Exposition closed. The most notable survivor was the Eiffel Tower, which had been deliberately built on Paris city owned land, to avoid demolition. The Exhibition included a building by the Paris architect Pierre Henri Picq. This was an elaborate iron and glass structure decorated with ceramic tiles in a Byzantine Egyptian Romanesque style. After the Exposition the building was shipped to Fort de France in Martinique and reassembled there, the work being completed by 1893. Known as the Sch lcher Library, initially it contained the 10,000 books that Victor Sch lcher had donated to the island.
